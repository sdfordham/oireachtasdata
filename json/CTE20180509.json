The purpose of today's meeting is to engage with Scouting Ireland in regard to governance, how child protection policies in Scouting Ireland are implemented and related matters.  The committee may also wish to explore matters such as the recent events that have resulted in reputational damage to Scouting Ireland, how it can reassure parents who have genuine concerns in respect of those events, the effect of the suspension of funding on Scouting Ireland, how the funding can be restored and what Scouting Ireland will do to achieve that.<\/p><p>I wish to advise members that although there have been media reports on the matter, it is important to note that the committee must not discuss individual cases or anything which is or is likely to be the subject of court proceedings and should avoid using individuals' names, whether those names are in the public domain or not.  In that context, it is also important to note that it is possible to identify an individual by using his or her title.  Members should also be aware that an investigation by Ms Lorna Lynch, BL, is currently under way into the actions of a number of senior volunteers in a case which is the subject of media attention.  I ask that members take that into consideration when asking questions so as not to compromise the investigation.  I also note that the entirety of the matter is being reviewed by an appointee of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.<\/p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. John Lawlor, chief executive officer of Scouting Ireland, Mr. Ian Elliot, independent safeguarding consultant, Mr. Martin Burbridge, honorary vice president of Scouting Ireland and team lead on this crisis management issue, and Mr. Kieran McCann, board member and provincial commissioner for the northern province.  They are very welcome and I thank them for their attendance.<\/p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I remind members to switch off their mobile phones or turn it to flight mode as phones left on silent will interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and it can adversely affect broadcasting.<\/p><p>I thank Scouting Ireland for the provision of its opening statement which I now invite Mr. Burbridge to deliver.  I will not be too strict on time.  I have read the statement and estimate it will take approximately ten minutes to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050900002#B00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525878600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Having been part of the leadership team which successfully created Scouting Ireland in 2003, when it was formed from two older organisations, I became the first chief scout of the new organisation.  I am currently the team leader of the governance change project, which encompasses the challenges being faced by Scouting Ireland at present.  I am accompanied by Dr. John Lawlor, who is the chief executive officer of Scouting Ireland and has a background in scouting; Mr. Kieran McCann, who is a scout leader in the Ardoyne area of Belfast and a member of the board of Scouting Ireland; and Mr. Ian Elliott, who is an independent safeguarding consultant.  Mr. Elliott is working with us to guide us through safeguarding changes.<\/p> <p>  Scouting Ireland wishes to thank the joint committee for its interest in and concern for the difficulties we are currently experiencing.  It was always the intention and stated commitment of the organisation to come before the committee.  As members will be aware, our preference was to do so after the completion of the investigator's report.  We are here today to address the committee's concerns as openly as possible within the constraints placed on us by the current investigation.  Unfortunately, the interim chair of Scouting Ireland, Ms Annette Byrne, is abroad and unavailable today due to a long-standing leave commitment.  Nevertheless, we are confident that our team has sufficient knowledge and expertise to provide the committee with the necessary information.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, we met the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and her officials on 19 April last.  Our lengthy, constructive and detailed discussion covered all the areas of concern.  We have since provided further information on cases of particular concern that were raised by third parties with the Minister.  We continue to engage regularly with the Department on these matters.  We are pleased the Minister has advised the D&aacute;il that in light of our conversation, she believes Scouting Ireland to be honest in its ambition and intention to make the reforms that are necessary.  Members will know that the Minister has appointed a former Senator, Ms Jillian van Turnhout, to provide her with a view on Scouting Ireland's governance.  Scouting Ireland welcomes this appointment and looks forward to working with Ms van Turnhout to provide the necessary reassurance to the Minister concerning the adequacy of the governance of our organisation and the project that is in train to improve our governance structures radically.<\/p> <p>  The withholding of funds has had an immediate and serious impact on the finances of Scouting Ireland.  A Government grant under the youth service grant scheme represents approximately one third of our funding.  This is primarily spent on funding our national office and professional staff salaries.  Our financial situation is now grave, with a requirement to place staff on protective notice in June.  Our reserves are limited.  The stop on funding has had significant indirect effects.  We are experiencing a loss of key staff because of the uncertainty of their positions.  Our board has taken steps to change our reserves policy, restrict our spending and husband our resources to maintain our operations for as long as possible.  We have experienced a negative reaction from creditors and suppliers.  This is affecting our day-to-day operations and, worryingly, our ability to put in place the necessary arrangements and facilities for our planned jamboree for 3,000 young people in July.  It is also affecting the planned recruitment of additional professional safeguarding staff.  The establishment of a pathway to the restoration of our funding is a vital requirement for us.<\/p> <p>  Scouting Ireland was established in 2003 as an unincorporated entity.  Scouting Ireland Services was established as a company limited by guarantee at a later stage.  The management and oversight of these two entities are enmeshed in a single board called the national management committee, which consists of elected volunteers.  At present, the volunteer national management committee exercises executive control in Scouting Ireland and directs the chief executive officer.  A governance reform project that is in its fourth year is working to change this structure to separate the oversight and executive functions and establish clear lines of accountability and responsibility.  This project, which has been accelerated so that it will reach its conclusion in October 2018, will facilitate full compliance with the code of governance for the community and voluntary sector.<\/p> <p>  In July 2017, Scouting Ireland on its own initiative commissioned Mr. Ian Elliott, who is an internationally respected expert in safeguarding, to review our safeguarding policies, procedures and practices to ensure we were conforming with best practice and were compliant with the Children First Act 2015 ahead of its implementation in 2018.  The chief executive officer asked Mr. Elliott to conduct a critical case review into a specific case.  The interim report produced by Mr. Elliott in October 2017 was presented to the board of Scouting Ireland.  The recommendations made by Mr. Elliott, including the stepping down of the child protection management team, which was a standing committee of the board, and the transfer of responsibility for safeguarding to the chief executive officer, were accepted in full.  It was decided that Mr. Elliott should provide professional supervision of case management in safeguarding until new structures and additional professional staff could be put in place.  That arrangement is continuing.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Elliott completed his second report in November 2017 and appended the requested critical case review.  This was presented to the board of Scouting Ireland in January 2018.  The critical case review was updated in February 2018.  The board resolved on foot of the critical case review to commission an independent investigation into whether named individuals acted appropriately with regard to a complaint.  It further resolved that the board would consider disciplinary actions based on the findings of that investigation.  Four senior volunteers who are directors of Scouting Ireland are the respondents in the investigation.  A barrister has been engaged to carry out this investigation, which is independent and at arm's length from Scouting Ireland.  It is anticipated it will conclude by the end of this month.  The report will be provided to our board for its consideration and action as appropriate.  We are concerned that this investigation should not be compromised by any external commentary or interference and we will avoid any comment on it while it proceeds.<\/p> <p>  The legacy safeguarding structure that was stood down in October 2017 on the recommendation of Mr. Elliott relied on a board sub-committee called the child protection management team with a volunteer chair and membership of senior volunteers, and with the child protection officer and chief executive officer attending.  Mr. Elliott identified serious weaknesses in this structure and particularly pointed to the vulnerability of volunteers to be lobbied in cases.  Mr. Elliott has proposed a new structure with an entirely professional management and expert oversight.  This will include a safeguarding co-ordinator, in-house case officers and external sessional case officers who will be engaged on a case-by-case basis.  A regional spread of expertise and overarching professional expert oversight will also be made available.<\/p> <p>  Scouting Ireland has 34 full-time staff supporting and serving 13,000 adult volunteers, who provide Scouting Ireland's programme to 40,000 young people in over 500 communities across the island of Ireland.  Our staff to volunteer ratio is by far the leanest in this sector.  Our human resources strategy, which was prepared recently, has identified a gap of ten full-time equivalent staff to meet our current requirements.  This is before the requirement to recruit additional safeguarding staff.  Scouting Ireland does not have the financial resources to close this human resources gap.<\/p> <p>  Scouting Ireland is in possession of historic case files covering safeguarding and child protection cases reaching back to the 1950s.  These pre-2003 files were passed on to Scouting Ireland from the two old scouting organisations after they resolved to form Scouting Ireland in 2003.  These files are securely stored by Scouting Ireland and are made available to statutory agencies as required.  Access to these files has been provided on occasion to assist investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  They have provided an important source of information in those inquiries.  In 2012, Scouting Ireland conducted a review of these files with the specific objective of determining if any person removed from the old organisations for child protection reasons had gained access to Scouting Ireland.  We encountered one such case, which was immediately dealt with by removing this person from the organisation.  No further such instances were uncovered in the review.  As part of meeting the recommendations set out in Mr. Elliott's report, a further indepth assessment of these files is planned and will be made under Mr. Elliott's supervision.  Since 2012, Scouting Ireland has carefully maintained safeguarding and child protection files.  We have worked to improve their quality, guided by the report and oversight provided by Mr. Elliott.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050900002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Burbridge"},{"type":"speech","time":1525878600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Burbridge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050900002#C00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1525878600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Before I open the floor to my two colleagues who have indicated - if others wish to contribute, please let me know - I wish to ask a number of pertinent questions to elicit further information on what I hope will be matters that are not before the investigation.

As mentioned in our opening statement, the board of Scouting Ireland has oversight responsibility, but also, because of the way we were structured, it has a number of people who have an executive function day to day and week to week.  We are changing that.  The board will become an oversight board with a senior management team which will be led by a chief executive officer and a number of senior department heads who will be responsible for delivering on the policies and services that are needed for our membership across the island of Ireland.  They will be reporting regularly, probably monthly and certainly no less than every two months, to the board of directors.<\/p> <p>  We want to make certain that the board of directors are more cognisant of the oversight functions.  The number on the board at present is 20 members and we are envisaging a smaller board, around 12 or 13 members, but the number is not quite finalised.  We are also envisaging that some members of that board will not be elected at the company AGM but will be brought in to ensure that we will have the right expertise, talent, and experience on the board.  That is a key element of this.  We need to ensure that we have external people as well as internal people with the correct balance of skills between all the different groups.

Approximately 200 leaders are vetted each month.  That is a large volume and means that we have a very strong relationship with the Garda vetting unit.  Vetting is imbedded in the culture of the organisation, but it is only one part of the application and induction process for a person who wants to work with us.  For instance, any new scout leader is required to undertake a residential training course which includes between four and five hours of training in child protection and safeguarding issues before he or she can commence or attend a meeting.  The process is rigorous.  Garda vetting is part and parcel of what we do.  It is a cornerstone of safeguarding and very important, but it is only one of the components available.  If somebody seeks to join, the checking of references is very important.  We need to know what the attitude of local leaders is to somebody joining a group.  That gives some idea of the process involved.  Garda vetting is limited in that it is only provides information on prosecutions and convictions, which are limiting factors.  I cite a sad statistic from the United Kingdom.  It is known that offenders could offend up to 100 times before coming to the attention of the police.  Garda vetting is a very important cornerstone and part and parcel of what we do, but it is not all of what we do to try to ensure those who work with us are safe to work with children.  I can advise that we are moving to a full cycle of revetting all of our leaders.  It will be done on a three-year basis and is viewed as best practice in the sector.  There are other additional safeguards.  We look forward to working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla to tighten the safeguards in place in local groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050900002#E02200","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Lawlor"},{"type":"speech","time":1525878600,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for entertaining my questions.

When will the audit of all historical abuse allegations take place?  Why has there been a delay in undertaking the audit or review?  Who will undertake the audit or review?<\/p><p>This question is for Mr. Burbridge, since it is in its historical files, why does Scouting Ireland not refer these allegations and the files to Tusla?  It is charged with looking at historical and retrospective cases.  From what I can gather, those files are in a sealed dungeon somewhere and, every now and again, the witnesses prod into them, have a look at them and come back out.  I have learned, with historical cases and retrospective cases, that people like that repeat and reoffend.  If there is somebody hidden in there that we are not aware of, he or she might not be a member of Scouting or Ireland or be participating, but could pose a risk to other children.<\/p><p> Are the witnesses aware of anyone against whom an allegation has been made previously who continues to work within the organisation or volunteers in Scouting Ireland?  Do the witnesses accept that, without completing this audit, there may be young members of the scouts who, today, may be at potential risk of abuse?  The delay in undertaking the audit is unacceptable.  I find it hard to believe that a conversation has been going on for 24 months.  On child protection, I was a member of the scouts as a chairperson and friend of my scouting group in Galway.  I was very proud.  All my children were scouts.  I understand the rigour of what is expected at a grassroots level.  I cannot understand why we have a problem at a higher level.  Will somebody explain to me where the governance fell down on the basic issue where we have 40,000 children involved?  Someone mentioned Garda vetting.  To me, Garda vetting is what the general public needs to be reassured of the fundamentals of any form of governance where children are involved.  It might not throw up everything but it is a barometer of measurement that we are doing our job right.  I have many questions and would appreciate the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050900002#E02400","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525878600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I can set the situation for Mr. Ian Elliot to come in.

I understand them and note the frustration that she expresses.  As someone who is coming as an independent person, from a safeguarding perspective, I share that frustration.  The total number of files that I have been informed of existing which were pre-2003 is in the region of 300.  Since 2003, to today, that has been added to by a further 500 to 600.  It would be my intention to look at all of those files and to read them to confirm that there is nothing in the content of those files that the organisation is not aware of and has not acted appropriately on.  The only way to do that is by sitting down and critically reviewing them, then providing an analysis and commentary to the organisation to make sure that something has not been missed.  Like the Deputy, I have a passion about what I do.  The reason I have continued to do it for the past 44 years is because the safety of young people motivates me.  It is frustrating when I meet with a situation where an organisation may have information that it should have acted differently on and has not pushed the buttons.  The only way I can be sure that that has not occurred is to sit down, do it and read the files.<\/p> <p>  I intend to do that myself.  It has not started yet because of the volume of work.  When I first made contact with Scouting Ireland in July of last year, I did not anticipate that I would still be working for it at this time and that I would still be as involved as I am.  It has been a process of revelation and development which I have tried to respond to and tried to guide the organisation through.  As mentioned in the opening statement from Mr. Martin Burbridge, the historic files are critical.  That is accepted.  It is a priority.  We will look at that by critically reviewing each one of them and ensuring that any information that should have been passed on to any other agencies that are working for the people or to the statutory child protection agency has been passed on.  It is a priority.  The leave is for one week.  I will go on holiday.  I have already been told by my wife that if I bring my laptop with me, she will shoot me, so I will not be doing any work.

I will take that first, if the Deputy does not mind.  It was the last thing she asked.  Our safeguarding team would deal with a volume of work like this.  These are 2017 statistics.  There were 160 advice requests, 62 new cases, 27 referrals to statutory authorities - the Deputy will understand that we have responsibility to report - 41 cases closed, and 21 cases still open.  Those cases would range in a spectrum from what is probably an inappropriate term, the less serious, to the most serious.  They would all require the opening of a file.  Some would involve actions that took place within the context of scouting.  Some would be where young people may have made disclosures to a trusted scout leader of something that has happened at home or in school.  The Deputy will understand that it happens.  That is a file for us and we have a reporting responsibility.  I, particularly, as chief executive officer, have a reporting responsibility.<\/p> <p>  The files are of quite a different nature to the pre-2003 ones and, as we go back to a period before those, with regard any professional involvement in the management of cases.  We have seen the responsibility to retain those files from the old organisation for the purposes of statutory authorities such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  They make good use of them when they need to but it has been on a case basis.  That case the Deputy made about the worry of somebody being in scouting who should have been removed is really important.  That was exactly the reason that we moved on this in 2012.  I was five minutes behind the desk as chief executive officer six years ago when it was brought to my attention that a scouter had been removed from one of the old organisations in the early 1970s and had gained access to Scouting Ireland.  He had been abstained and removed and we had to deal with that.  I was faced with the worry at the time that there might have been others.<\/p><p>We brought back veteran staff from the old organisation who understood the files.  They went through them with us in a systematic way.  We traffic-lighted them as either red, amber or green, with red meaning that we had to act immediately, amber meaning that we had something to do but that it was not immediate and green meaning that everything was okay.  Fortunately, we ended up with seven amber lights, but it had the limitation of being staff-led.  We had no one with the expertise or insight of someone like Mr. Ian Elliott, but we engaged in that due diligence exercise at the time.  We have since retained the files which are openly available to those bodies with statutory responsibility, particularly Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the case to this day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050900002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Lawlor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525878600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>What is the number since 2012?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050900002#G00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525878600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>We are talking about roughly 70 files a year, multiplied by the number of years.

That is important because it needs to have that knowledge to ensure Scouting Ireland is appropriately resourced to deal with whatever the workload is.  The only way it can do that - I have argued for this and it has been approved - is to have safeguarding as a standing item on the agenda for every board meeting that takes place.

It is probably awkward to ask Mr. Elliot the question when the CEO is sitting beside him, but the CEO has brought in Mr. Elliot to do a job and I will proceed on that basis.  There are a number of sample cases on file during the tenure of the CEO and Mr. Elliot is going through an internal process, albeit with an external consultant.  I have dealt with him in the past on the Cloyne report.  Historically, we have had much engagement on the national board for safeguarding children in the Catholic Church.  Had it not been for him, the Cloyne report would never have seen the light of day.  We did a great deal of work on it and I appreciate the work he has done in safeguarding children.  However, I have a difficulty in understanding why, for instance, if an investigation is ongoing into a sample number of files during the CEO's tenure, the board and the CEO have not stepped aside from the process and the investigation has not become a fully external process on the basis that there is considerable taxpayer funding at play and there is a massive disparity between the ordinary experiences of the leader of a scout troop and the children and those who operate in the upper echelons of the organisation.

Dr. Lawlor is subjecting himself to an internal process to appoint a new board of directors to reflect the new realities in which he finds himself.

I have questions about whether there have been documented complaints made by volunteers - this is adult scout leaders - against members of the board, right up to CEO level, or other staff, or whether there have been allegations of bullying, for instance.  Have reports been commissioned by Scouting Ireland to examine complaints and the mechanisms by which it can resolve those complaints in a mediated fashion?  Have the reports been published and have they been provided, for instance, to all parties involved?  Those are just some of the questions that are still on our minds, which have not been presented to us here as representatives of taxpayers' interests in relation to the submissions today.  We do not know if there are any legal cases open against the organisation by volunteers for alleged harassment, for instance.  If we are talking about change management and if it is a change management structure from within and the board is hoping to bring all of these people with it, I suggest that it does not necessarily have the confidence of a lot of people in the organisation on the ground.

We need that difference and external view being brought into our board to make sure that it is more open to things and is not internalising all the time.  That is one of the problems we have had.

Mr. Lirim Grei&ccedil;evci, the Republic of Kosovo ambassador in Ireland.  The ambassador has gone to great lengths - taking a middle of the night flight - to be with us today.  We very much appreciate this.<\/p><p>More than one month ago the European Commission published a draft strategy document that outlines a possible enlargement perspective for the western Balkans.  This committee looked at the strategy and the various documents that were published at the same time.  We agreed this was a very important issue that we would want to consider in more depth.  As a small member state that has benefited greatly from our EU membership, Ireland is often interested in and supportive of other countries that would like to make the same journey.<\/p><p>At our last meeting we had a good engagement with the Commission official who is responsible for this area of work, and with representatives from Albania and Montenegro.  We are delighted to have the ambassador with us today.<\/p><p>I remind members about the rules on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that a member should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p> <p> Before I invite the ambassador to make this opening remarks, I would like to tell him a nice story that he might not be aware of.  Many years ago, when there was trouble in Kosovo, a number of people from the country came to Ireland.  They were flown into Kerry airport, which is in the county I represent.  My father was an Oireachtas Member for the county at the time and he asked me to drive him to the airport.  I drove him there late at night but when we got there, the Kosovans had not left the plane.  My father insisted to the security people that he be allowed on to the tarmac where the plane was parked.  The steps were put down and my father insisted on being at the bottom to shake hands with every person who came off the plane.  One would have to know my father.  Members know what he was like, God be good to him.  When he shook hands with a man, it was not enough to shake hands.  He would hit him on the back and welcome him.  He was gregarious about his welcome.  I was standing alongside him and we met young children as well.  I will speed dial on to a couple of months ago.  I met a tall, young gentleman in his mid-20s and he reminded of that night.  He was the son of people who had gotten off the plane.  He said that when they were coming down the steps, having landed in a strange country and not knowing where Kerry was, they were so happy that this man was at the bottom of the steps.  He said my father nearly broke his father's back telling him how welcome he was in County Kerry.  The young boy went on to be educated there.  Many of the Kosovans returned home but that young boy and his parents stayed.  He is a valuable member of our community now.  He enjoyed his upbringing in the county and he is working now.  However, he reminded me of that story recently and I thought it would nice to let the ambassador know what we thought of the people who came from Kosovo at that time.<\/p> <p> I welcome him to the meeting.  We appreciate him taking the time to be with us.  I invite him to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018050900002#A00200","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525870800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members.  It is a great honour to appear before the committee on this special day - Europe Day.  Every year, 9 May is a public holiday in Kosovo.  It is a day off and, technically, it should have applied to me as well but I am happy to be here.  Kosovo's parliament, shortly after the declaration of independence on 17 February 2008, decreed that 9 May should be a public holiday to show Kosovo's clear EU aspiration.  On this day, many public events take place in Kosovo such as concerts, lectures, town hall meetings and so on to explain how the EU works and what the EU stands for.  Kosovo is the youngest country in Europe and this year we are marking the tenth anniversary of our independence.  We are enormously grateful to the people of Ireland for showing so much generosity and friendship to Kosovo.  I was touched by the Chairman's story.  I have heard many similar stories from those who were transported from the refugee camps in Albania and Macedonia at the time to this great country.  I thank him very much.<\/p>  <p>  The Kosovan people are among the most pro-EU in the western Balkans and our strategic goal is to join the EU and NATO.  For us in the western Balkans, and most notably in Kosovo, the EU is crucial to our present and our future, primarily as a catalyst of reform of democracy, governance and the rule of law and of economic growth but perhaps, more important, as a guarantor of peace, stability, good neighbourly relations and reconciliation.  The EU is not merely a trading bloc; it is at the core of all peace agreements in our region, starting from the Dayton peace accord for Bosnia, the Ahtisaari plan for Kosovo, and the Ohrid agreement for Macedonia.  We need the EU in many ways but it also needs the western Balkans to ensure all of Europe is free, stable and democratic.  We belong in Europe not just geographically, but also politically, culturally and economically.  Europe is our home.<\/p>  <p>  Thanks in large part to the EU, the western Balkans has made substantial progress and today is more peaceful, stable and democratic than ever before.  However, progress remains fragile and many unresolved issues loom large.  In that regard, we welcome the publication of the draft western Balkans strategy by the Commission in February 2018 in which the EU perspective on all six western Balkan countries was ensured, including for Kosovo.  We fully understand that the EU accession process is merit-based but as is emphasised in the strategy, the Union is more than a technical process.  It is a generational choice based on fundamental values.  The EU is the biggest investor and trading partner in our region.  Western Balkans' leaders, government officials, civil servants and members of civil society interact with one another regularly in EU fora and EU-backed regional initiatives.  We are looking forward to the next EU-western Balkans summit in Sofia on 17 May, which will be followed by a London summit in July as part of the Berlin process.  Important initiatives are on the agenda such as interconnectivity, road and railway infrastructure linking our countries, digital economy and society, youth, security and so-called legacy issues, which are the unresolved political issues in the region to do with good neighbourly relations, reconciliation and mutual recognition.  In that regard, we welcome the recent announcement by the Commission to open accession negotiations with Albania and Macedonia.  Kosovo supports the EU integration of all our neighbours because we all stand to benefit from a region anchored in European standards and values.<\/p>  <p>  Kosovo has benefitted immensely from EU assistance.  We host the largest ESDP rule of law commission, EULEX, in Kosovo, and the first contractual relations between Kosovo and the Union in the form of a stabilisation and association agreement entered into force in April 2016.  That is an important step towards candidate status.  Kosovo's relations with the EU, however, have an added complication due to a lack of recognition by five member states - Spain, Romania, Slovakia, Greece and Cyprus.  Kosovo is primarily a European issue and we count on all our European partners to recognise the fact that leaving the country behind or in limbo will not contribute to stability and reconciliation in the region.  While we understand the complexities surrounding the decision making in certain member states, we reject any comparison between Kosovo and other cases.  Kosovo is a unique case arising from the violent dissolution of Yugoslavia, international intervention and a UN-led process to determine Kosovo's status.  The International Court of Justice, which is a UN body, in 2010 ruled that Kosovo's declaration of independence was in accordance with international law.  While the EU enlargement process is of paramount importance, addressing the underlying unresolved political issues in the region remains key to further progress.<\/p>  <p>  The EU facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, which has yielded important results.  To date, some 30 agreements have been signed at a technical level, including a first agreement governing the normalisation of relations.  The two presidents have met numerous times in Brussels in the presence of the EU High Representative.  We strongly welcome the EU position, which is part of the strategy I mentioned, that there needs to be a comprehensive, legally binding normalisation agreement between both countries in order that they can advance on their respective European paths.  The implementation of the existing agreements by Serbia is not satisfactory and the EU must do more to ensure what is agreed on the negotiating table is implemented in order that the trust of the public in the process can be maintained.  However, none of this would have been possible without the EU leverage, which we must cherish and maintain.<\/p>  <p>  We also welcome the EU's position in the western Balkans enlargement strategy that countries aspiring to join the Union will not be permitted to import any problems or disputes with their neighbours.  This must be followed through in our region as freedom of movement of goods and people in the region is still an issue, most notably between Kosovo and Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.<\/p> <p>If the public does not see and feel any meaningful practical benefits from regional integration, there is a risk they will lose faith in the EU integration process also.<\/p> <p> Reconciliation and good neighbourly relations are at the heart of the EU and we remain hopeful the EU will keep the momentum in the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue so that lasting pace and full recognition can be realised.  We support Serbia's European agenda provided it acts in accordance with European values and looks to Brussels for solutions.  We must not allow nationalism or any malign foreign influence to disrupt the good results we have achieved together.  For Kosovo, the EU has no alternative.  We are Europeans and our place is within the European Union.  We will continue to implement the EU criteria, abide by EU rules, standards and values, and maintain and seek the best neighbourly relations with all our neighbours.  The EU and all member states, however, should also heed Kosovo's call and allow it to move forward.  Our region of the western Balkans will only be fully at peace and stable if it is firmly grounded in its natural habitat of the European family of nations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018050900003#B00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We agree entirely that the western Balkans is important to Europe economically and from the point of view of stability and peace.  The European Union represents the largest peace agreement which has been reached in approximately 500 years and it has worked very well, with the exception of the western Balkans where we had a difficulty a number of years ago.  It took quite a long time before the influence of the USA, the EU and other bodies was brought to bear in a huge effort to bring about peace in the region.  It is an uneasy peace in many ways.<\/p><p>Most members have been to the region on more than one occasion.  I think I have been to all of the western Balkan states, in fact.  It is timely for the western Balkan states to reaffirm their intentions.  The ambassador is quite right about that.  There is no use being a candidate for membership of the EU unless there is realistic progress.  The ambassador is right that membership may cease to be an objective if other objectives are being considered.  The easiest ones are not always the best ones.  It is better to conform to the standards laid down by the European Union and what that entails.  I acknowledge that we are going through a difficult time in our relations within the European Union.  With Brexit, a member state is leaving, which is a sad thing and something which could have a lasting negative impact on the Union unless it is handled well.  So far, the negotiations have been handled well by Mr. Barnier and his colleagues because there is a recognition that if one country benefits at the expense of the Union by leaving, everyone will scatter within a short space of time.  There is no rationale as to what the next best thing to do is.<\/p><p>I welcome the ambassador warmly and I hope he has a fruitful time here as he meets the various bodies he proposes to see.  Most important, and as was said at a recent meeting here, I note that the western Balkans has tended to be part of a pressure zone between two continents.  It still is.  Its importance remains the same as it was 100 years ago and more.  It is even more important now, in fact.  We welcome what the ambassador has said.  The European Union is similarly positive.  While one gets the odd person who says the European Union developed too quickly, that is not true.  There were very few options.  There are times when options are limited but decisions must be taken as to what is the best thing in such contexts and in a particular window of opportunity.  The opportunity may otherwise be lost.  We hope the opportunities which have been there for some time will remain and that the EU and the western Balkans &ndash; each country in its turn &ndash; can respond positively and quickly to meet the criteria laid down in the <i>acquis communautaire<\/i>in particular.  Not all existing member states comply with that at all times, but we think positively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018050900004#C00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1525871400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The ambassador is very welcome and I thank him for his presentation.  Deputy Durkan and I do not agree fully on the benefits of expansion in Europe.  I believe there is a point at which diminishing marginal returns from expansion kick in.  Any expansion which takes place must be managed carefully and to the benefit of the Union rather than of the applying state.  As to the issue of peace, I have visited that part of the world and it is truly beautiful.  It is quite sad, however, that as one tries to move between the different states, one still senses hostility.  It is a reflection of where things are right now.  While it has underpinned peace in the wider European framework, the European project has not provided a peace association or club.  We are a trading bloc and trade is what we are about.  From that point of view, the European Union will support any efforts to underwrite peace in the region, but it is not there to guarantee it or to set it up.  That is my view of it.  This is something, as the ambassador said in his speech, that the states themselves must do.  They must find the reconciliation that is required.<\/p>  <p>  Reconciliation is difficult as there were quite a few bloody years in the region.  A great deal of hurt and many open wounds remain to be healed.  Reconciliation is the major issue for the western Balkans as it moves forward.  Kosovo would be welcome in the European Union.  I see no reason all of the western Balkans should not be part of the EU.  While I support the accession of the region's countries, they must find that reconciliation and peace among themselves before they are welcomed in.  In addition, the issue of free movement must be sorted out.  Moving across the western Balkans must be seamless.  The ambassador cannot be unaware of the way in which we in Ireland are trying to hold on to the seamless border we have.  That is what the European project has to be about: seamless movement from one state to the next.  One should be unaware as one travels where one is exactly with respect to which political entity is ruling a geographic area.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted the ambassador has attended.  His speech was forthright and honest and I wish his country well as it makes its way forward to become part of the European project.  I wish Kosovo the peace the ambassador's speech sought.  I hope there is reconciliation.  After all, we are all doing the same thing, which is to struggle our way through this life to our eternal rest, wherever that may bring us.

Obviously, there are still some issues to be addressed in Kosovo but I hope it is getting there.  We will be happy to do anything we can to support Kosovo.  It took a long time for Ireland's application for EU membership to be accepted.  We agree with the expansion of the European Union and do not wish to pull up the ladder behind us and to take all the benefits for ourselves.

He is assigned to the United Kingdom and Ireland.  Kosovo has a close relationship with Ireland.  During the conflict Ireland was very involved, as the Chairman said with regard to Kerry.  In Roscommon, which is a long way from Kosovo, there was a considerable amount of support and truckloads of supplies were sent out.  It was a harrowing situation and was really bad around Easter 1998.  We had great sympathy for the country's plight and there was a great response from the Irish people.  Many people came to Ireland from Kosovo, settled here and have been very successful.<\/p>  <p>  There is no question that its future is with the European Union.  I was very involved with Montenegro when I was doing a report for the Council of Europe.  When I was there I visited the camps where there were many people, including Roma, from Kosovo.

I have visited some of the camps and they were better than most.  However, it is not a place to rear families.  Most of the people want to return to Kosovo, but in the meantime Montenegro is looking after them as best it can with the help of the European Union and the Council of Europe.  I do not know what role the ethnic groups that fled Kosovo during the conflict will have back in Kosovo in a situation where it enters the European Union.  It is very important to have integration.<\/p>  <p>  The ambassador's speech and views are important, and I believe this committee will be supportive of what Kosovo is proposing.

I am delighted to hear the very generous support in the committee for Kosovo and its aspiration to join the European Union.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that the European Union is key to stability in our region.  The western Balkans is not an isolated region but is part of Europe and its place is in the European Union.  Of course, the criteria must be met.  As the European Commission has stated in its western Balkans enlargement strategy, this is very much an objective process in which countries will be assessed on their merits and on whether they have met the criteria.  This is a painful process in many ways for our countries, but they are necessary reforms to bring our institutions in line with European standards.  It is a little easier for Kosovo, however, because it is a young country, and when Kosovo became free in 1999, it was placed under UN administration for eight years.  In 2008, we declared independence in parliament.  Since the Kosovo parliament was established in 2001, we have benefited enormously from international expertise in drafting laws that were fully in line with European standards.  Our legislation is in line with European legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I accept Senator Craughwell's point that the EU is also a trading bloc.  That might have been the starting point but underlying the trade is peace.  Nations that trade with each other do not wish to make war on each other.  When I said that the EU is the guarantor of stability, peace and security, I did not mean the guarantor of hard security.  We have NATO in our region and NATO is the guarantor of hard security in Kosovo.  The EU is there to cement.  It is a glue that will keep everything together.<\/p>  <p>  I can relate a personal story from 2011 when we started the dialogue to normalise relations with Serbia.  When we declared independence in 2008, the Serbian Government adopted a decree banning all contacts between Kosovan officials and Serbian Government officials.  It was in Brussels in 2011, and I was there as part of the team, and we shook hands for the first time with our Serbian colleagues after independence.  We have been meeting regularly ever since in Brussels and elsewhere.  The two presidents have met perhaps 15 times.  The Prime Ministers are present in all the regional meetings.<\/p>  <p>  If it was not for the EU leverage, I do not think we could have done it.  US leadership has been key, of course, to ending the wars and bringing civility, but the EU carried the torch from there onwards.  The EU leverage is still important and is still working in our region.  It is key to bringing about full normalisation of relations between Kosovo and Serbia.  Both Serbia and Kosovo want to join the EU, and the EU western Balkans strategy explicitly demands that there must be legally binding agreement in the end so both countries can join the EU.  They will not join at the same time.  That depends on how fast the reforms are introduced and so forth.  This is the path ahead, however, and without the EU we would not have been able to do it.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the conflict in the past and the ethnic groups mentioned by Senator Leyden, there was a terrible war in Kosovo in 1998 and 1999 in which close to 1 million Kosovans were deported from their homes to Albania, Macedonia and elsewhere.  NATO intervened with an air campaign for 78 days.  Most of the Kosovans were able to return home after NATO entered Kosovo, including Irish peacekeepers.  I believe there are still Irish peacekeepers in Kosovo.  I have seen their patrol cars many times.  It is important to have them there.  There was some ethnic division after the war but I am proud to say that today the Kosovo parliament is fully multi-ethnic.  All ethnic groups are represented in the parliament and the government.  There are Serb MPs in parliament and Serb Ministers in the government.<\/p>  <p>  There are still some issues in the north of Kosovo where Serbia still holds considerable influence, and we suspect Russia is meddling in our affairs there as well in a negative sense.  We have signed technical agreements, however, to integrate the northern part of Kosovo into the judiciary and the police.<\/p> <p>In all of this the EU has played a key role.  It is an interface between Kosovo and Serbia.  We are not happy with the implementation process and we would like to see more EU involvement in ensuring that the agreements are implemented.  All in all, we are happy that we are part of European integration process.  As I said, we have an issue with five member states that do not recognise Kosovo, but so far they have all supported the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which is the first contractual relations between Kosovo and the EU.  We hope to continue with the next logical step, which is to get candidate status and then open accession.  By that time we are hopeful a legally binding agreement will have been reached with Serbia and that it will have recognised Kosovo, or that Kosovo would be able to join the United Nations as a member and then we would have global recognition.  We are enormously grateful to the Irish Government and the Irish people for their support.<\/p> <p> As a final thought, we as a country are trying to join as many international organisations as we can.  We would very much count on Ireland's support in the Council of Europe and elsewhere when we are ready to apply in order that Kosovo can be a full member of the international community.

I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before this committee to advise members on the role of the national doctors training and planning, NDTP, in consultant recruitment and retention in mental health services, as well as to discuss the role of the consultant applications advisory committee, which has the unfortunate acronym of CAAC.<\/p> <p>  I shall outline the role of the NDTP division.  The division was established in November 2014.  It is a division of the HSE's national directorate for human resources.  The NDTP's statutory remit is outlined in the Health Act 2004 and the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  <\/p> <p>  I will read the first paragraph of my presentation in order to set the scene but abbreviate the rest.  The main objective of the  NDTP is to ensure that the Irish health service is provided with an appropriate number of specialists, who possess the required skills and competencies to deliver high quality and safe care, and whose training is matched to the model of healthcare delivery in Ireland, regardless of location.  In order to meet this overarching objective, NDTP focuses on the three core domains of medical education and training, medical workforce planning, and the consultant post approval process.  It is important to state that NDTP does not recruit non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, or consultants for the HSE or HSE-funded agencies.<\/p> <p>  The recruitment and retention of doctors has been evaluated in the report entitled Strategic Review of Medical Training and Career Structure 2014, which is also known as the MacCraith report.  I am sure the members are familiar with the report.  It contained 27 recommendations on several themes, including training, consultant issues, hospital configuration, medical workforce planning and specific recommendations for service specialties.  I have provided a tabular statement that shows three categories of outcomes: positive outcomes; areas of progress, and slow progress.  I will leave members to read it themselves.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the HSE's approach to training numbers in mental health as it is an area of interest for the committee today.  The NDTP, in conjunction with the postgraduate medical training bodies, agrees on the intake numbers of doctors in training for each specialty on an annual basis.  The principles utilised by the HSE-NDTP to underpin the number and types of specialist training posts required by the health service remains consistent from year to year.  I have listed the principles.  Will I take them as read? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1525869000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#B00400","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525869000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>In terms of medical training in mental health, to meet legislative obligations the HSE has established formal, structured contractual arrangements with any organisation that provides medical education and training.  These arrangements have been  formally incorporated through service level agreements between the HSE and training bodies.  For mental health, the service level agreement is with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, which is the formal recognised training that is credited by the Medical Council.<\/p> <p>  It is important that I outline how postgraduate training, which takes place after an intern year, is structured.  Traditionally, postgraduate specialist training is delivered in a two-stage process.  First, there is basic or initial specialist training.  Members will know it as senior house officers or SHOs, which is a term that we still use today.  Second, there is higher specialist training, which is known as specialist registrars.  In recent years there have been significant changes in the delivery of postgraduate training in Ireland.  Many training programmes have transitioned towards a model of streamlined or continual training so that people move directly from initial specialist training to higher specialist training.  The next paragraph of my presentation is on streamlined training, which I shall take as read. <\/p> <p>  It is worth reflecting on doctors in training in mental health.  In 2017, as many as 233 trainees undertook initial specialist training in psychiatry and 104 undertook higher specialist training in psychiatry.  That means there are 337 doctors in total training to be specialists in psychiatry.  They are divided into two streams.  Child and adolescent psychiatry has 20% of the trainees and adult psychiatry has 80% of the trainees.  I have outlined the numbers in my presentation.  I have also provided some charts showing data.  Figure 1 shows the number of trainees per year in initial specialist training over the past several years. <\/p> <p>  On page 4, tabular statement No. 2 shows data about consultants.  One can see the following: 104 doctors work in child and adolescent psychiatry; 259 doctors work in adult psychiatry; 43 doctors work in the sector called the psychiatry of learning disability; and 52 doctors work in the sector called the psychiatry of old age.  The total is 458 consultants and we have half the number of trainees as we have consultants in psychiatry.<\/p><p> Figure 3 shows the age profile in psychiatry.  Between a quarter and a third of consultants are more than 55 years of age, indicating problems for the future in terms of retirements.<\/p><p> Figure 4 shows a topic that has been discussed a considerable amount in recent weeks, namely, the number of psychiatry consultants not on the specialist register.  This figure shows that, depending on the subspecialty, between 4% and 9% of doctors working in psychiatry are not on that register.  In other words, they do not have a certificate of completion of training.<\/p><p> Members will note from figure 5 on the number of doctors in psychiatry that, depending on the subspecialty, between 13% and 22% of consultant psychiatrists hold non-permanent contracts of one sort or another.<\/p><p> Figure 6 shows the geographical distribution of psychiatric consultant posts by healthcare setting.<\/p><p> These tables show more or less the first half of what I want to address in an abbreviated form, that being, the role of the HSE's national doctors training and planning, NDTP, with a particular emphasis on psychiatry.  I am happy to take questions on this or to proceed to the second part, as the committee wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525869000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Professor Murray should proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#C00200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525869000,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I will outline the consultant recruitment and appointment process.  Many factors influence successful recruitment and retention of consultants, for example, the supply of appropriately-trained candidates, structure of posts, configuration of service, geographic location, and terms and conditions, including remuneration.  In 2015, the then director general of the HSE requested Professor Frank Keane, the national clinical lead in psychiatry and a former president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, to lead a process to address a range of issues associated with the creation and approval of consultant posts and successful recruitment to these posts.  Professor Keane's report, which is available on our website, followed close engagement with all stakeholders.  It diagnosed a consultant recruitment and retention crisis and noted that, &quot;a key driver of the large number of vacant posts was a Consultant recruitment and retention crisis&quot;.<br\/><br\/>A range of factors contributed to this crisis, which are outlined in my submission and I will take as read, although I would be happy to go through them if the committee wishes.  In addition, the report found that, &quot;some hospitals [and healthcare settings] struggle to recruit Consultants in any specialty or in a particular specialty&quot;.  It noted:<\/p><blockquote>[...] a key concern for many potential candidates for Consultant posts in recent years has been salary.  Starting salary, progression through points on the salary scale and how new appointees compare to colleagues appointed in earlier years are all reported as influencing decisions by potential candidates to apply or to accept an offer of a post.<\/blockquote> <p>The 2015 salary rates represent a partial restoration of the pre-2012 rates, albeit consultants appointed under these rates take longer to progress to the final point on the scale and that final point is lower than the one for consultants appointed before 2012.  There are two tiers of pay for consultants.<br\/><br\/>While access to private practice differs according to contract type, it also varies by specialty and location of post.  The 2008 contract aimed to address this by providing for a substantial difference between a type A salary, where the consultant has no access to private practice, and types B, B* and C, where they have some access to private practice.  However, changes to consultant remuneration have reduced the difference between type A and other contract types.<br\/><br\/>Data from the Public Appointments Service, PAS, regarding the number of applicants for 45 consultant posts indicate that the lowest number of applicants - zero to one in most cases - were for consultant posts in: level 2 or 3 hospitals, which are smaller hospitals; psychiatry, particularly psychiatry outside urban centres; emergency medicine irrespective of location; radiology, including radiation oncology; and pathology, including histopathology.  Data provided by the PAS regarding 129 posts indicate that, of the 102 consultant posts across all disciplines that received fewer than five applications each, 31 were in psychiatry.  Psychiatry seems particularly difficult to recruit into.  Table 3 shows 16 posts that were advertised in 2016 but received no applicants.  They are consultant psychiatric posts across all psychiatric subspecialties and in all parts of the country, particularly in mental health services that are remote from urban centres.<br\/><br\/>The tenure of consultants is an indicator of difficulties with recruitment and retention.  Data from the NDTP DIME database, which is a medical database, for this year to date indicate that psychiatry has one of the highest percentages of non-permanent consultant post holders at approximately 20%.  That is high.<br\/><br\/>The consultant applications advisory committee, CAAC, is a part of the recruitment process.  I have been asked to outline it to members, so I will discuss it, although a colleague who is present, Mr. Andrew Condon, has a longer history with the CAAC than me.  Consultant posts in publicly-funded hospitals, mental health services and health agencies are regulated under law.  Between 1971 and 2004, posts were regulated under the Health Act 1970 by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, an independent statutory body under the Department of Health.  In 2005, regulation transferred from Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al to the HSE.  The HSE's regulatory function covers all consultant appointments in the public health system, including HSE hospitals, voluntary hospitals, mental health services and other agencies, be those additional, replacement, temporary or locum appointments and irrespective of the extent of the commitment involved or source of funding for the appointments.<br\/><br\/>In response, the CAAC was established by the CEO of the HSE under the 2008 consultants contract.  The purpose of the CAAC is to provide independent and objective advice to the HSE on applications for medical consultants and qualifications for consultant posts.  The CAAC provides a significant opportunity for consultants and national clinical directors to contribute their expertise and professional knowledge to the decision-making processes for the development of consultant services in all specialties throughout the country.  The CAAC considers all new and replacement consultant posts for mental health services.  My submission lists the CAAC's membership.  It meets ten times per year and provides advice on each post.  That advice can be to approve, seek clarification, amend the post or refuse approval to the post.<br\/><br\/>The CAAC advises HSE on the appropriate qualifications for consultants.  Advice provided by the CAAC is forwarded by NDTP to the national director of human resources, to whom responsibility for the regulation of consultant posts has been delegated by the CEO of the HSE.  In turn, the national director regulates each post, taking into account the advice provided.  When the CAAC considers a post and recommends its acceptance, it still has to go through several other processes before it is filled.  The CAAC is a middle part of the recruitment process.<br\/><br\/>Table 4 of my submission lists the number of consultant psychiatry posts that appeared before the CAAC.  Table 5 shows the number of consultant posts in psychiatry, which has increased by 50 in approximately five years.<br\/><br\/>This abbreviated statement summarises the roles of NDTP and the CAAC.  I am happy to address whatever questions committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1525869000,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Murray.

The first is that the hospital has to identify a need, either for a new post or for replacement of somebody who has retired or is coming up to retirement.  If it is within the acute hospitals, it has to go to the acute hospitals to get approval for funding.  That is step one.  That has nothing to do with NDTP.  NDTP only has a role in running the CAAC committee in respect of actual recruitment and retention.  It does have a role in workforce planning but that would not have anything to do with this process at all.  Once it is funded, it comes before the committee which looks at several main things, including how the application fits in with the national strategy for a particular specialty.  There is a comment from the specialty lead, for instance Philip Dodd in respect of mental health posts.  The committee also considers how the post is structured, whether it is feasible and workable and whether the resources are there.  That would be the second issue.

I thank the witnesses for being present.  I have some questions on their submission but would first like to ask a couple of more discursive questions.  The witnesses are focusing on the technicalities, numbers of people in and people out, who is approved, what is advertised and all of that, and we do need to drill down there as well.<\/p> <p>  Would Professor Murray say that the Irish mental health system is consultant led?  Would that be a fair way of describing it?  What bearing does that have on the kind of mental health system we have?  We have a big concern in this committee about reliance on medication as opposed to all the other types of support.  We are not against medication but we do think there is a preponderance of that.  <\/p> <p>  I would be interested to know - again more from their experience in the clinical side of their work - how the witnesses feel doctors and consultants in the mental health system work with psychologists and therapists.  It takes a whole team to enable a person to get better.  What is the witnesses' commentary on interdisciplinary work?  Is it the norm in Ireland?  Are there any good examples we can draw on as a committee?<\/p> <p>  The submission states that in 2016, 16 mental health consultant posts were advertised and received no application and that they were in the smaller hospitals in rural areas - Sligo-Leitrim, Cavan-Monaghan, Oberstown, Carlow-Kilkenny, Donegal, Longford-Westmeath, Laois-Offaly, Waterford-Wexford and south Cork.  Can the witnesses give us an idea of what that means, particularly in a psychiatry-led service, if that is how they agree we could describe the mental health service?  What does it mean in terms of the child or adult seeking support?  Have the posts been filled?<\/p> <p>  Given the recruitment and retention difficulties in psychiatry, the impending retirements and the 20% reliance on non-permanent positions, do the witnesses see an alternative to a psychiatry-led mental health system?  Has there been any thinking done on that?  Is it done anywhere in the world?  Is there anything that would be worth exploring for our committee?  I know the witnesses have responsibility for specialists but what is their view on GP training?  The GP clinic is where people come to in the first instance and the GP is the person who will be with them in the long run.  What is their commentary on the state of mental health training for GPs?  Is it in accordance with best practice?  Is it adequate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#D00900","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1525869000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and ask Professor Murray to answer as succinctly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#D01000","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525869000,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her questions.

It is particularly marked in psychiatry.  As the Senator identified herself, some of those posts are in the more rural settings.<\/p><p>That is a problem in Ireland and everywhere.  It is much more difficult in most jurisdictions to recruit consultants to non-urban centres for a whole variety of reasons.  Partly it is to do with people making lifestyle choices.  It is also partly to do with the fact that when one is working in a smaller setting, for instance, it can be much more challenging.  When one is working in a setting with more colleagues, one has a greater range of expertise and sense of working in a team which makes work a lot less stressful.  These are almost existential questions.  They are worse in psychiatry and mental health services than they are in other specialties.  If one looks at consultant posts with no or one applicant, psychiatry is, unfortunately, a leading specialty in that regard.<\/p><p> What are the alternatives in these circumstances?  My own long-term view is that psychiatry being doctor-led is probably the right way to go.  In some settings which are remote and more difficult to staff, however, we need to be more creative.  If one looks at Canada, for instance, where remoteness is on a different order of magnitude to here, it has some differences in how it recruits and retains medical staff and other staff.  We possibly could learn from Canada as well.  However, I would argue that what we judge as remote is not really remote by Canadian standards.

The HSE set up a unit of administrators and clinical staff to address that issue.<\/p> <p>  One of the functions of the NDTP is workforce planning.  Another is the negotiation of service level agreements with the training bodies to control the number of trainees, to deal with issues around rotation and quality of training.  A third function is providing support to the consideration of consultant posts.  If one goes back 40 years to the 1970s, there was an agency, Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al, whose only function was to regulate consultants.  It decided whether an application for a consultant post was fit for purpose.  That was a statutory function under the Health Act 1970.  That function was given to the HSE.  Between 2005 and 2008, the HSE did that on its own without input from the wider clinical community, training bodies, patient representatives and so on.  In 2008, a committee was set up under the consultant contract, namely, the consultant applications advisory committee, CAAC to which Professor Murray referred.

It is received by NDTP which will put it in front of the next meeting of the CAAC, which meets on a monthly basis.  If there are no issues, it will be approved on the day.  An approval letter will be drafted rapidly.  Once that is drafted and signed, it goes to recruitment.  This is the administrative process, but it reflects the legal obligations the HSE has under the Health Acts.  It reflects the idea that sometimes what is proposed in the system is not fit for purpose.  For example, a particular surgical post will not be put in place in a hospital which does not provide that service.  Historically, there has been that need to regulate the system.  It does act as a control on the number of posts because the number of consultant posts has actually increased exponentially over the past ten years, going up by 41% since 2008.

If hospital management sees a lack of services which are needed, then there should be a common sense approach.  For example, among psychiatric nurses, there is a significant concern that within the next five to six years more than 1,700 of them will retire.  However, there has not been one mention of forward planning to fill those gaps.  Between 300 and 500 positions need to be filled to bring psychiatric services to where they should actually be but there is a process where we cannot get applicants.  How is it Tallaght and St. Loman&rsquo;s have 43 vacancies, St. Joseph&rsquo;s in Portrane, 58 vacancies, Waterford, 26, and Louth-Meath, 34?  Is there somebody in control to say we need these vacancies filled?<\/p> <p>  It is also claimed there is an issue with money.  I have encountered cases where common sense seems to disappear.  For example, a young person is admitted to an accident and emergency department and is waiting for an assessment to CAMHS, child and adolescent mental health services, but the assessor is missing.  There does not seem to be a process which will ensure the patient can be moved.  Is that politics or is that under some mental health rule?  That seems to be an overlapping problem.  We have young children who are absolutely victimised and terrorised in an accident and emergency department because of the policy that if one cannot get it in one hospital, one will certainly not get it in another as the hospitals need to justify their numbers.  There seems to be a big fudge.<\/p> <p>  We keep on hearing there is a problem with staff retention.  I have spoken to qualified people around the country who have told me they cannot get a job in the services.  There does not seem to be a common-sense approach.<\/p> <p>  One fifth of consultants in most psychiatry wards are working in non-permanent contracts.  Professor Murray referred to the issue of consultants trying to balance between public and private systems.  If they are trained at a cost to the State and contracted to the State, then they should spending more time in the public sector hospitals.  Why can we not get the consultant psychologists and psychotherapists?  It should involve a common-sense approach of stating a consultant is needed in ward A today and not ward B as there is an emergency.

There seems to be, however, nobody in any of the systems who can flag this.  Again, it goes back to reactive instead of proactive approaches.  There is a possibility that so many staff will retire within the next 12, 16 and 18 months.  Does Professor Murray believe a process should be put in place and an onus put on management to have these appropriate questions asked to ensure they can plan forward?  Is Professor Murray aware of anybody who had worked in the system who retired but was then rehired?  There seems to be a blind patch there too.<\/p> <p>  The crux is recruitment and retention.  The barrier we are hitting all the time is that we cannot get the qualified staff.  This is, apparently, because we do not have an effective way to train them or hold on to them.  The only way to hold on to them is to give them a proper contract.  Professor Murray referred to problems with recruiting for rural areas.  I do not believe that, however, because rural areas are cheaper in which to live.  We have a situation in Dublin where rents are so expensive that nurses could not be bothered coming to work in the city because they cannot survive.  Many mental health instances are rural-based.  We should be promoting recruitment to such areas as an option.  I asked the Minister two months ago to roll out pilot projects in this area.  Enough surveys and research have been done to identify the blackspots.  There does not seem, however, to be any joined-up thinking.  It just seems to be the various community healthcare organisations, CHOs, all pulling against each other.  Looking at the figures for the vacancies, it is like shovelling snow while it is still snowing.<\/p> <p>  I just want to know who is responsible and where the buck stops.  Who do we bring in here and ask why we cannot have 50% of the 26 vacancies in Waterford filled in six months?

I am going to take the end part of the recruitment process involving the candidates.  Have any proactive steps been taken to address this?  It is all fine talking about the attractiveness of a job specification and this, that and the other.  If the recruiters are not proactively going out to headhunt and bring people into a job, then there will be a falling down.  I know that from my own work in recruitment.  I did headhunting for years in the private sector.  Other parts of the HSE have been successful in gaining staff where there have been staff shortages.

In recruitment, one might say we should know at the start of the year what posts are funded since we have a national service plan.  That is one source of posts.  Another source is when people retire or leave and they have replacements.  A third source is during the course of an average year in the health service, we will get additional funding for various purposes which will generate additional posts.  We have posts coming from three directions, two of which we can anticipate and one of which we cannot.<\/p> <p>  In terms of retirements, NDTP already notifies hospitals of retirement dates of consultants, for example that Dr. Smith is retiring next year or in two years' time, and asks the hospital where the application is for his or her replacement.  That controls the anticipated retirements to a certain degree.  When people take up posts we know their retirement dates and we deal with that.  What we cannot plan for is the unanticipated retirements.  The other issue that arises with retirement is that while the average duration of a consultant career is 25 to 30 years, the post that was approved 25 or 30 years ago may not be the post that is needed today.  When someone retires, it is not a simple matter of rolling over and getting an identikit replacement.  It often sparks a local debate around the structure of the post and its nature.  To go outside psychiatry, we might have a consultant respiratory physician that people want to replace with a gastroenterologist.  It is not as simple a process as it might be.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remember that we have new posts, service plan posts and replacement posts, some of which we can plan for and some of which we cannot.  In terms of the issues Professor Murray has mentioned regarding the posts under discussion today, the core of our recruitment issues is supply.  Are the trainees there?  In the case of the work of the Public Appointments Service that I discussed with Deputy Neville, we found the supply did not exist internationally.  We could approve posts but we were simply creating vacancies because the candidates were not there to fill them.<\/p> <p>  The second issue that arises is location and the resources and configuration of the service.  That is connected to the implementation of A Vision for Change, the multidisciplinary team and so on.  The third issue is terms and conditions.  Do we pay people enough?  Are their contracts structured correctly?  In the last years we have had our end-to-end review of the recruitment process, the Keane report.  Professor Murray has started his work and we have also had industrial relations engagement with the two medical unions.  We are currently engaged with the Public Service Pay Commission on the terms and conditions for consultants.  One of the things we have flagged in our submission to the commission is that psychiatry is the number one recruitment challenge for consultant and medical posts in the HSE.  That submission has gone in and some of the issues the Deputy has raised have been flagged in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Condon"},{"type":"speech","time":1525869000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>The Professor made a point that the problem is getting the actual applicants.

When a consultant takes up a post, he or she may find that he has no office, no secretary, and that many of the members of his community psychiatric team are not there: there is no psychologist, no psychiatrist, no social worker or senior social worker or there is half a social worker or a part-time psychologist who is shared between two or three catchment areas.  Pay and conditions are obviously an issue and the years of austerity decimated the pay and conditions of consultants.<\/p> <p>  During a debate in the D&aacute;il last evening another Deputy said that we are the greatest exporter and greater importer of doctors in the world.  We educate them and then we export them and then we trawl the world looking for replacements.  That is surely a damning indictment of our health service.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise the issue of anticipatory recruitment.  The post of a consultant who is about to retire may not be advertised until he has retired from his job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#J03100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1525869000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>That is correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050900002#J03200","speaker":"1428"},{"type":"speech","time":1525869000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>He or she may have flagged well in advance when he is leaving.

The HSE does not embrace them and does not see them as a natural resource, but sees them sometimes as an impediment.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of consultants who are not on the specialist register.

This has been an intensely difficult time for everyone involved, most importantly the individuals, the women, and their families.  The events of the last ten days in relation to CervicalCheck have shaken the confidence of the public and me, as Minister, in the very fundamentals of our healthcare system.  Fundamental values of honesty, truth and openness have been questioned.  Our commitment to these vital principles and values has rightly been questioned.  <\/p> <p>  We have a long road to travel to restore public confidence but I am determined as Minister to get to the bottom of what happened here and why such a crisis of confidence and trust came to pass.  I want to briefly outline for the committee the steps I propose to take, first, in regard to examining issues relating to the CervicalCheck issue itself, and second, in regard to the broader issues of open disclosure, of the approach to medical negligence claims, and of accountability.  First, however, I want to put on the record of this committee my thanks and gratitude to Ms Vicky Phelan, who has played a central role in bringing these issues to light.  I want to take this opportunity to thank her again for her courage in doing so. <\/p> <p>  I want to see all issues relating to CervicalCheck examined and dealt with without delay.  Accordingly, the Government is establishing two strands of investigation.  The first strand of investigation is the scoping inquiry.  Yesterday, I announced that Dr. Gabriel Scally has agreed to lead this inquiry.  He will be joined by Dr. Karin Denton, who is a leading expert in women&rsquo;s health.  Yesterday I also published the terms of reference for the inquiry.  These reflect the cross-party engagement that has taken place.  I want at this committee today to thank all the Opposition spokespeople on health for their assistance and  constructive engagement on this.  I believe that, as a result of that cross-party approach, we have terms of reference that are comprehensive and allow for the full examination of all of the issues arising and the concerns raised by other parties in the Oireachtas and other groupings as well as the concerns of the Government.<\/p> <p>  However, what is most essential is that the inquiry deals with the concerns of Ms Phelan and the other women affected or their family members.  Dr. Scally has already spoken with Vicky Phelan, and will continue to engage directly with her and with other women and their next of kin who are willing to and wish to do so.  I anticipate and expect the scoping inquiry to report by the end of June and have asked that it provide a progress update in the first week of June.<\/p> <p>  The second strand of the investigation is the clinical strand.  This is an international clinical expert review to be carried out by a panel established from representatives of the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK.  This panel will comprise a full team of senior independent medical experts from outside Ireland.  Their review will ensure that each woman with a diagnosis of cervical cancer who had a previous smear through the CervicalCheck will have her case reviewed so that her concerns can be addressed, including in respect of the timing of her diagnosis, the nature of her treatment and the outcome of her care.  These two strands of investigation are crucial to, first, establish the facts; second, determine what action is needed to address the issues;  and, third, help to restore trust and confidence of women in CervicalCheck.  This will lead then to a commission of investigation.  I acknowledge that Deputy Alan Kelly pointed out to us the need for this.  The Government has committed to that in principle, but it is important that we gather all the facts and the data through the scoping inquiry process between now and the end of June.  This is essential because, despite its failings in regard to disclosure, the CervicalCheck programme works and it is important we are clear on this.  Since the inception of the programme, more than 1,200 invasive cancers have been detected by CervicalCheck.<\/p><p>In addition, 30,000 low-grade abnormalities have been detected and more than 50,000 women with high-grade abnormalities have been diagnosed and treated, considerably reducing their risk of developing cervical cancer.  The incidence of cervical cancer has been falling and there has been an increase in earlier stage diagnoses.  We all want this progress to continue. <br\/><br\/>It is particularly concerning that the events of the past ten days have undermined people&rsquo;s confidence in the clinical performance of screening programmes.  The facts available do not give any reason to believe the screening programmes have operated outside or below international benchmarks for screening programmes.  I very much hope that as we move forward with these two strands of independent investigation, led by international experts, women will begin to feel reassured about the programme&rsquo;s effectiveness.  Women can consult with their GPs if they want to discuss their concerns and arrange a repeat smear test if necessary without charge.  An agreement has been reached with general practitioners in that regard.<br\/><br\/>There are a number of broader issues which have come to the fore as part of the CervicalCheck issue.  These are, first, open disclosure; second, the way we approach medical negligence claims; and, third, accountability.  I believe addressing these issues to ensure that we do as much as possible to improve this system and patients&rsquo; experience of it are absolutely essential if we are to restore trust and confidence that has been so badly eroded in recent weeks.  I intend to focus on these as a priority.<br\/><br\/>It is clear that the delayed communication to Vicky Phelan of the results of the clinical audit of her case and the absence of communication of results to many other women following clinical audit is significantly out of step with the standards rightly expected by the public and with best practice in regard to open disclosure.  I am pleased that yesterday the Government approved the drafting of a patient safety Bill, which will provide for mandatory open disclosure to patients of those serious events which will be the subject of mandatory external notification.  It is part of a major programme of patient safety and patient centred reform under way.  It is led by my Department and includes a range of measures to increase openness and transparency, including patient safety statements, annual quality reporting and the national patient experience survey, the second round of which is under way in our hospitals this month.  It also includes major legislation to provide for licensing, clinical audit and the extension of HIQA&rsquo;s powers to the private sector as an important step on the journey to full licensing of our health service.<br\/><br\/>Our tort laws have rightly been criticised for being adversarial and slow to provide for persons who have suffered harm within the healthcare system and there has been a growing recognition of the need for reform in this area.  My Department has collaborated with the Department of Justice and Equality on a suite of reforming legislation including on pre-action protocols, mediation and periodic payment orders.  I also intend to engage with the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Finance and the State Claims Agency on whether further improvements can be made to the legal framework and the management of medical negligence.  Such an approach should complement and inform the major programme of patient safety and advocacy under way.<br\/><br\/>The Sl&aacute;intecare report placed an emphasis on the need for both clinical and managerial accountability and states:<\/p><blockquote>The Committee strongly believes there is a requirement for clearer clinical and managerial accountability and governance throughout the system.  This includes clarity at all levels, from the Minister for Health, the Department of Health, the HSE and healthcare providers. <\/blockquote><p>I intend to bring forward legislative proposals next week to provide for the appointment of a new HSE board.  In addition, as part of my Department&rsquo;s response to Sl&aacute;intecare, it is proposed to consider how best to further strengthen clinical governance and managerial accountability in healthcare.  I mentioned last night in the D&aacute;il that I have met R&oacute;is&iacute;n and Mark Molloy who pointed out what other jurisdictions have done on this, particularly Australia.  We need to look at how other jurisdictions have managed to crack this.  It is possible to do it.  It has happened in other countries.<br\/><br\/>Returning to business, I will start by talking about an ambition we all share, which is to reform our health service.  Among the recommendations put forward in the Sl&aacute;intecare report are accountability legislation setting out the requirements on the Minister and staff at all levels of the health service; the introduction of a board for the HSE, with the chair accountable to the Minister and the CEO accountable to the board; the development of a strategic national centre complemented by regional integrated structures that would be accountable for delivering integrated care; and the development of a blueprint for clinical governance across the health system, underpinned by legislation which specifies standards and structures.  These recommendations are central to delivering meaningful reform of our health service.  <br\/><br\/>I have said it many times in this committee, in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere but it is important to state it for the record again.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report and the cross-party support it enjoys presents us with a unique opportunity to deliver long-lasting reform that will fundamentally change the way we deliver healthcare to provide fairer, better and more accountable healthcare for all our citizens.  The Government is fully committed to leveraging the support and momentum of the Sl&aacute;intecare report to put in place a robust programme of reform and associated implementation arrangements.  Just as cross-party co-operation and support was required to bring forward the Sl&aacute;intecare report, similar cross-party co-operation and the support of all stakeholders will be required to implement the recommendations.<br\/><br\/>I am pleased to say I have already been able to take action on a number of the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I have already outlined to the committee the Bill I will bring forward on reinstating a HSE board.  I ask for the co-operation, which I know will be forthcoming, of the committee in getting the legislation through the Oireachtas as an absolute priority to send out a very concrete message on accountability.  We all agree on the need to ensure more robust and transparent structures of accountability and the appointment of a strong, skills-based board is essential to achieving this.  I also prioritised the Sl&aacute;intecare committee&rsquo;s recommendation to consider the impact of removing private practice from public acute hospitals.  This is a far-reaching, complex reform but, let me be clear, it is absolutely fundamental to achieving a fairer, more equitable health service.  I have established, in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare committee's recommendations, an independent review group, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir, to examine the impact of separating private practice from the public hospital system and to outline the roadmap to follow to bring that about.  The group has advanced its work very well and will conclude its work this year.  This will provide valuable guidance on how we go about implementing this major, fundamental recommendation and eliminate private practice from our public hospitals on a phased basis.<br\/><br\/>My Department has also commenced work on the committee&rsquo;s recommendations on changing the HSE structure itself.  As members will be aware, this is an area I addressed when I appeared before the Sl&aacute;intecare committee.  We have a HSE that is overly centralised when it comes to decision-making, responsibility and accountability.  With governance too far removed from the front line, the HSE has become too big to fail and too big to succeed.  Real accountability requires more local ownership and decision-making.  An important component of this will be the development of regional structures to support the delivery of integrated care.  The first step in this process is to better align our current regional structures &ndash; our hospital groups and community healthcare organisations. <br\/><br\/>Developing more comprehensive and integrated community care is at the heart of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  A public consultation has opened on the geo-alignment of hospital groups and community healthcare organisations.  Alignment can go some way to delivering and being a key enabler of delivering integrated care.  The role that general practice will play within this is absolutely vital.  I have now secured Government approval to move forward with contract negotiations with general practitioners and I expect to see progress on this in the coming months.  The engagement has commenced and there is Government commitment to supporting the negotiations with a multi-annual programme of funding.  It is a game-changer for delivering identifiable improvements in general practice.  It is a different space for me as Minister for Health saying I want to negotiate a new contract because it is backed up with resources from right across Government.  <br\/><br\/>The Government has already committed to the establishment of a Sl&aacute;intecare programme office and the recruitment process for the executive director of the office has been carried out through a very thorough process by the Public Appointments Service, involving a national and international executive search.  I expect to have an announcement on the name from the Public Appointments Service very shortly.  The final interviews have concluded.  <br\/><br\/>While all reform is important, we know it must also be matched by increased investment, particularly with regard to capacity.  I touched on a number of these issues last night so I do not propose to do so again unless the committee wishes me to do so.  They are the capital plan developments; the additional 2,600 hospital beds to replace the failed policy of the past of cutting hospital beds in our health service, long before the troika ever arrived in town; the need for 4,500 more community beds to deal with our older population; the need to build three new elective hospitals, one in Dublin, one in Galway and one in Cork; the need to co-locate all stand-alone maternity hospitals with acute adult teaching hospitals; and the fact that is now funded.  In terms of Sl&aacute;intecare, we are providing &euro;1.6 billion in our capital plan to fully deliver the e-health agenda and the ICT programme.  The committee highlighted that it is not a discretionary extra and if we wanted a reformed health service we needed a proper e-health system and an ICT system.  <br\/><br\/>I will conclude on that point.  I look forward to having the opportunity to brief the committee further, to hear its views and take any questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#C00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I call on Mr. Dean Sullivan, deputy director general of the HSE, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#D00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525852800,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend its meeting this morning.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Anne O'Connor, national director of community operations, Ms Angela Fitzgerald, deputy national director, acute hospital services, and Mr. Damien McCallion, national director for national screening services.  Mr. Killian McGrane from the women and infants programme is also here.  The director general is sitting to my right.<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased to be here today on what is my first appearance before the committee.  In preparation for this meeting, the committee requested information and replies to a number of specific questions and it will have received a written response to them.  I will therefore confine my opening remarks to the following issues.  <\/p> <p>  First is an update on CervicalCheck.  As the committee is aware, there are a number of strands to the work of the serious incident management team which has been working solidly over the past 12 days with the aim of addressing and allaying the concerns that women and the wider public have about CervicalCheck and its audit process.<\/p><p>Regarding our work to make contact with women directly affected by the failure of CervicalCheck to inform all women of the audit process and its findings in relation to their smears, I can confirm that hospitals have been working since the serious incident management team was established to contact all the women affected and to discuss the audit findings with them.  To date, 201 women and their families have been contacted.  I understand it has not been possible to contact the remaining eight people and their families to date, as some women are not in the country because they are travelling or living abroad, or are uncontactable for other reasons.  All 201 women or their families have been offered a meeting at the earliest opportunity with their doctor at a time that is suitable and convenient to them.   <\/p><p> I can confirm the National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, is working with the CervicalCheck programme to carefully reconcile data held by the registry and CervicalCheck to ensure that we have identified all women diagnosed with cervical cancer since 2008 who had a screening history with CervicalCheck.  We expect to conclude this data reconciliation process over the coming days.  The establishment of an expert international review panel, led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the British Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, will review the results of screening tests of all women, including any additional women identified by the NCRI and CervicalCheck data reconciliation process, who have developed cervical cancer and who participated in the screening programme since it was established in 2008.  This will provide independent clinical assurance to all women about the timing of their diagnosis and any issues relating to treatment and outcome.<\/p><p> As members will be aware from the daily reports published by the serious incident management team, we are working to provide call backs as quickly as possible to concerned women who have rung the information line.  As of yesterday, 11,982 women have called the line.  Of these, 8,150 women have requested a call back, and of these 3,649 calls have been returned.  As members will appreciate, the call backs take a period of time, as in those cases where the person has a history of referral for colposcopy treatment or a history of cancer, we are providing a clinical consultation with a clinical staff member with expertise in colposcopy or cancer treatment.  Return calls to women have been made throughout the weekend and will continue through this week, with support from staff in health facilities around the country.  The clinical advice is that women who have had normal test results in the past can continue to participate in the cervical screening programme according to their normal schedule.  We are working to provide information to women across a range of channels to assist those whose query can be answered without the need for them to call the CervicalCheck information line.  Since we began measures to provide public information across a range of channels, the proportion of callers having their information needs met and therefore not requesting a call back has dropped significantly.  <\/p><p> I would like to put on record my personal apology at the concern and anxiety that has been caused to women and their families and the wider public as a result of the CervicalCheck controversy.  It is essential that we learn lessons and re-establish confidence in the screening programme, as the Minister said, which was and is a public health initiative saving literally hundreds of lives.  In this regard, I very much welcome the decision announced yesterday by the Cabinet to establish a scoping inquiry into the issues which have recently come to light.  I assure members, the women and families affected and the public at large that the HSE will participate and co-operate fully with this process and with the work of the external expert panel to ensure all of the facts surrounding what has occurred will be known, that we can learn from this and importantly that trust and confidence in our national screening programmes will be rebuilt.  <\/p><p> Turning to the Portiuncula Hospital report, last week the Saolta University Health Care Group published the report of the External Independent Clinical Review of Maternity Services at Portiuncula University Hospital.  The review examined 18 cases from the period 2008 to 2014.  I wish to make the following comments in light of the publication of the review.  There have been a number of important developments since the initial review into the therapeutic hypothermia cases in Portiuncula in 2014.  There is now a strong policy framework in place, with the development of the national maternity strategy in January 2016, the development of the national bereavement standards in August 2016, and the launch of HIQA&rsquo;s national standards for safer better maternity services in December 2016.  <\/p><p> Following on from the policy framework, the national women and infants&rsquo; health programme was established in 2017 to implement the strategy, and to provide leadership and governance for maternity, neonatology and benign gynaecology services.  During 2017, the programme visited all 19 maternity hospitals and units at least twice; supported the hospital groups to develop maternity networks, and launched the implementation plan for the national maternity strategy.  In 2018, an additional &euro;4.55 million in development funding was allocated to maternity services.  The key priorities for that include the introduction of foetal anomaly scanning and the appointment of 28 additional sonographers has been approved; and the supporting of new models of care, particularly the supported care pathway, which is a midwifery delivered approach and is a key focus for 2018.  To support this, 52 additional midwives have been approved to take forward the pathway in each maternity hospital or unit.  A national implementation group has been established to oversee the development.<\/p><p> On quality and safety, the women and infants programme will be supporting maternity networks to develop a serious incident management forum dedicated specifically for maternity services within each maternity network.  A key focus of the national infants' and women&rsquo;s programme will be to develop these new tools with the services and to improve learning outcomes.  Finally, on maternity networks, as the Minister noted, effective governance is a core recommendation in the maternity strategy and more generally in the planning and delivery of health and social care services.  Managed clinical networks, called maternity networks, are being progressed and should provide the necessary governance, and ensure that smaller units work closely with tertiary units in ensuring that the provision of consistent, high quality, safe care to women and their infants.  <\/p><p> The Sl&aacute;intecare report provides an ambitious vision of a different kind of healthcare system.  It signals a new direction of travel in relation to eligibility, delivery, and funding of health and social care in Ireland into the future.  It presents an opportunity and, appropriately resourced and governed, it has the potential to transform the health and well-being of the population, and how and where they access services.<\/p><p> As stated in the HSE national service plan 2018, a key priority for the health service this year is to develop an agreed strategic position with the Department, in the interests of building a safer, more sustainable health service, designed to meet the needs of our population.  An opportunity to achieve this is presented in the detail of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We will continue to work closely with the Department to ensure that we realise this opportunity.   <\/p><p> Integrated health and social care is at the heart of the report which would see healthcare delivered at the lowest appropriate level of complexity through a health service that is well organised and managed to enable comprehensive care pathways that patients can easily access and service providers can easily deliver.  As members will be aware, the consultation on integrated health and social care, and alignment of CHOs and hospital groups, is currently under way, with a closing date of 23 May.  This is an important engagement and we look forward to learning the outcome and participating in consideration of all of the factors involved in any proposals around integration and alignment, as optimised health service delivery is at all levels of delivery is a common aim.  <\/p><p> In the national service plan 2018, we highlight four key reform themes; first, improving population health; second, delivering care closer to home; third, developing specialist hospital care networks; and fourth, improving quality, safety and value.  These themes line up fully with key strategic actions within Sl&aacute;intecare and provide the basis of a phased shift within the way we deliver our services, commencing in 2018, which lays a foundation to build on through specific actions which support the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  <\/p><p> We are also enhancing our planning, delivery and our accountability roles to support change so that it results in service improvements and better experience and outcomes for people.  I very much look forward to the upcoming publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan which will inform our corporate plan for the next three years and be visible in the actions planned through our annual planning process for 2019.<\/p><p> The &euro;10.9 billion capital investment in healthcare infrastructure announced in the recently published Government&rsquo;s national development plan 2018-2027 is very welcome.  It represents a significant increase in capital investment over the next decade compared to the past ten years.  This increased allocation will allow the HSE to address the areas of greatest clinical and infrastructural risk including the equipment replacement programme in addition to enabling the HSE to deliver on the current capital programme.  This allocation will also allow the HSE to plan, develop and commence a construction programme to meet the additional capacity demands outlined in the recently published health service capacity review 2018.  As the Minister noted, the allocation will also allow demonstrable progress to be made with the e-health agenda over the next ten years.  <\/p><p> The committee&rsquo;s invitation letter made specific reference to the availability of Versatis, and a more detailed briefing note on the up to date position has been provided for members.  For the purpose of the opening statement, I would just like to reiterate that prescribing patterns for this medication had become grossly out of line with expectations for its licensed indications and usage, and access control measures were necessary to address this for patient safety and cost reasons.  Members will note from the details circulated that the medication continues to be available for licensed indications, that is, for nerve pain after a previous shingles infection in adults, and a quick turnaround application and appeals system is operational for unlicensed or exceptional access for individual patients.  Latest figures indicate that the medication continues to be reimbursed by the HSE for approximately 3,000 patients.<\/p><p>I would like to make a few brief comments on Storm Emma, which was one of the worst storms to hit the country and severely challenged all front-line services.  At this time, when the service is making many headlines for the wrong reasons, and the public's trust is reasonably undermined, it is important to acknowledge when the service gets things right.  I am sure committee members will join me in recognising the huge efforts of staff across the service, supported by staff from other sectors, who went way beyond the call of duty in the face of almost impossible conditions to ensure all essential health and social care services continued to operate during that period of particularly severe weather.  The values and commitment of healthcare workers were particularly demonstrated during this very testing time.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement and my colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":453,"content":"<p>Before we start I welcome to the Gallery Mr. Jack Kavanagh who, unfortunately, suffered a serious neck injury in a surfing accident.

I will begin by directing my comments to Mr. O'Brien.  As he may be aware, Fianna F&aacute;il's position is that we would like to see him step back with immediate effect without prejudice.  I am very conscious that as spokesperson I have asked for this publicly in the D&aacute;il and in the media but not in a position where Mr. O'Brien has had the chance to respond to it.  I would like to put it to him to give him the chance to respond in open session.  I take no joy in the call and I am very conscious he has given many years of public service to healthcare.<\/p> <p>  The reason the party believes that at this point it would be better for the healthcare system and the women affected by the CervicalCheck scandal if he were to step back is that while we must all wait for the investigation to establish all of the facts, it is abundantly clear that he was in charge of the organisation.  The Minister in his opening remarks referred to non-disclosure as significantly out of step with public expectation and best practice.  This is a very polite way of putting it.  It has been a catastrophic failure of governance.  Sadly, it has led to a collapse in public confidence in critical screening services.  Women across the country and, indeed, men when they meet a consultant will ask whether that consultant is telling them everything and whether the HSE has told their consultant everything.  They may question the literature.<\/p> <p>  We found out at a committee meeting last week that the CervicalCheck literature states the test is not 100% accurate.  We found out later in the same session that it is, in fact, 70% accurate, which is a serious error in the accuracy of the information to the women.  Yesterday, a High Court judge described as scandal the fact that one in 25 so-called consultants in this country are not in fact consultants as they are not registered.  The public may even now be questioning whether the consultant sitting in front of them is, in fact, a consultant.  Public confidence is rocked.<\/p> <p>  Specifically with regard to Ms Phelan's case, there was a failure to anticipate the public concern which has led to such widespread anger and worry, and there was a failure to react quickly enough to it.  As of last Saturday, approximately 800 women had had a call back.  We know this number has increased considerably in recent days, but the number of women who have had a callback is still less than half.  Obviously this case has been known about for some time.  These are the reasons.  As I said, I take no pleasure in it, but I want to put it to Mr. O'Brien directly in this forum so he has the opportunity to respond to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#F00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525852800,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for the courteous way in which he has addressed the question.  I appreciate it.  It is correct to say these are significant issues.  Last week, the committee heard from all of the other witnesses present who indicated I had not, in fact, been informed of the circumstances of this case and neither did I know it was coming, in circumstances where, in fact, it would have been relatively straightforward for them to get themselves off the hook by stating I had.  They had no particular benefit in not doing so.  I intend to continue the work it has been agreed with the Minister that I will do to address all of the issues which are of significant concern.  I appreciate the Deputy is suggesting I should resign without prejudice.  I am not 100% sure what that really means, but I understand it is intended to be polite and intended to be respectful and I do not take that away from the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the operation of the helpline, it is, of course, important to note that while full clinical consultations have not been completed with all of those waiting for them, they are being provided at an accelerated pace with significant commitment from a huge number of medical professionals, most of whom worked throughout the bank holiday weekend and continue to work.  It would be wrong to think this means there has not been any follow up.  There have been further updates by text and other means to indicate those calls are going to be made.  It would be very easy for us to carry out a cosmetic exercise of having an unqualified person make a return call to all of those women, which would be of little or no value.  Instead what we are doing is ensuring a meaningful complete clinical follow-up with each person who requested one, which can take half an hour or more to be effective.  While clearly it would be preferable if they could all have been done more quickly, as a matter of practical reality that could not be done in a meaningful way which would bring benefits to the women who have requested those calls.  While I recognise the concern, I believe the effort under way to address that concern is appropriate and meaningful.

When we were at the committee meeting last week, Mr. O'Brien told us he found out from an app on his phone about Vicky Phelan's case.  I am interested to know his views on whether he thinks at this stage, with the full benefit of hindsight, that it was appropriate that as the head of the organisation he was not told about a case such as this, with the massive implications we now see?  I am specifically asking because we are discussing whether we need to introduce legislation and whether that legislation would, in fact, have an impact on the culture.  To be able to consider whether it would have an impact on the culture we need to understand what the culture is.  The culture of the organisation appears to be one whereby people in very senior positions do not feel they need to tell the person who is heading up the organisation a potentially catastrophic piece of information.  We all see that it took legs of its own.  It is either that as the head he does not encourage people to share that information with him, that the people who are reporting to him think he would not be interested in it, or that the culture of secrecy and cover-up, and all of the other words used, goes right up to the top of the HSE.<\/p><p>With the benefit of hindsight, does Mr. O'Brien now feel that the senior managers should have made him aware and certainly before he found out via an app on his phone?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#F01300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525852800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I thought I had said last week that I was not at all happy for multiple reasons.  The Deputy asked a multilayered question and I will try to give a multilayered answer.  The first thing is that I believe that had I been aware of this case in all of its magnitude, it would have been possible for me to put in place a number of steps which, while not taking away from the case itself, would have meant that the organisation was far better prepared to deal with the fall out of it.  In other words, if I had become aware in advance that the matters disclosed as a result of discovery indicated that it was far from certain that all the women the programme had set out to tell had been told, it would clearly have been greatly beneficial if all of that communication had been completed so that by the time this came into the public domain, there would have been no woman out there wondering whether she was one of those who should have had that communication.  In fact, that is the most important aspect because that is probably the single thing that has damaged confidence in the programme and led to all the calls to the helpline.  Had I known and had I been made aware of all of the implications of this - had I been given the information, I would have figured out the implications for myself - I would certainly have put in place a different approach to how the whole thing should have been dealt with.  That is the first point.<\/p> <p>  The second point, and the Deputy asks a fair question, is whether the culture I have attempted to create encourages people to tell these things.  Yes, it is.  The Minister tells this story sometimes.  On the wall in my office is a sign that says \"speak truth to power\".  I put it up the second day I was in the job back in 2012.  The reason is because, by statute, the HSE is one of the most hierarchical organisations possible.  The role of director general is quite a powerful one in that sense.  After a round of meetings and briefings on my very first day, it appeared to me that people were reluctant to tell me stuff so I put this sign up, brought everyone back into the room and had a repeat set of discussions encouraging that this would be a place where everyone could tell me whatever they needed to regardless of whether they thought I would like it.  It is not dissimilar to a process that Pat Lamb introduced when he was manager of Connacht - the safe zone.  I have encouraged a process of people telling me stuff.  Why was I not told about this one?  At the moment, it appears that those who should have told me did not see the significance of it but this does form part of the inquiry.  Yes, I should have been told and I have sought to create a culture in which I should be told these things and, by and large, I am told about these key issues.  I was not told about this issue and I am very concerned about that.  The Deputy knows I am on the record as supporting mandatory open disclosure or duty of candour, as it is typically referred in the states that have legislated for it.  It would not necessarily change the way people make their judgments but it would bring a sharper edge to the judgments they would make and I would hope that if such a duty existed, I would have known about this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Given the time limitations, I will put all this into one comment and two questions, which the witnesses can answer collectively if that is all right.

We are now sitting here on the morning of Wednesday, 9 May.  Do the Minister, Mr. Breslin and Mr. O'Brien feel there are any major issues or items of information relating to this scandal of which they have not yet been made aware or about which they are concerned they may not have full information?  This is an opportunity to say so.  Last Tuesday, I described as a bombshell the occasion when the Minister came to the Chamber and revealed that he had just been told about what we now know are 1,621 or 1,624 cases of women who had not been audited.  This is a very important question that is addressed to all three.  When did they individually or their organisations become aware or find out that National Cancer Registry Ireland was not sharing some data regarding women with cervical cancer with CervicalCheck?

The first question is whether I would be concerned that there could be other issues or scandals of which I have not been made aware.  I am not aware of any others.  I have put everything I have learned relating to this into the public domain as quickly as I received it and that is the way I intend to continue to operate in respect of this matter.  If I had absolute confidence that there were no other such issues, we would not need a scoping inquiry so after the two weeks we have seen, I think it would be foolish to sit here and say I do not have more concerns.  I think Deputy Kelly will see in the terms of reference, which we have all discussed collectively, that I am trying to tease out a number of those issues as part of this.  I know Dr. Scally's first report is due in approximately three weeks and that his final one is due in six or seven weeks.  Until I see the initial report, I cannot go any further because, in the aftermath of what happened in the past two weeks, that is the prudent course for any Minister to take.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the second question, which concerned when I became aware of the issue regarding National Cancer Registry Ireland not sharing its data with CervicalCheck or the fact that CervicalCheck did not know of all the cases with National Cancer Registry Ireland, I was told by my chief medical officer in the company of the Secretary General and the assistant secretary just before I went into the D&aacute;il on Tuesday last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#G00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525852800,"counter":471,"content":"<p>In respect of the first question, I am very much with the Minister.

However, I will complete the process.

It appears that the State Claims Agency may have been aware of the seriousness of this issue but did not communicate it to people working on the front line.  In the current structure, a claim comes in against a medical consultant in a hospital and is passed on to the State Claims Agency.  There may be some consultation initially but my information is that the next communication from the State Claims Agency is when the matter comes up for hearing in court.  There does not appear to be communication in the intervening period and the seriousness of a claim does not appear to be conveyed back to people on the front line.  Are these current structures being reviewed?  It is extremely important, especially where there is a series of claims.<\/p> <p>  My next question is on the general public's understanding of the cervical screening process.  There seem to be different views on how accurate and comprehensive the process is.  It does not, for example, identify certain cancers.  Is anything being put in place to get more detailed information out there to the general public about the programme, what it can identify and what it cannot identify?

I have now directed the HSE's internal audit division to do that.  There is a significant potential to improve the process.  For example, if different parts of the organisation are involved in a case raised by a plaintiff and handled by the State Claims Agency, a discovery process is followed in different parts of the organisation and two or three parts of the discovery are joined up, but this is done by lawyers in the State Claims Agency and not people in the HSE.  I want to put in place a process whereby the discovery is matched up by someone from within the HSE who will be better able to identify the danger signs, the warnings and the risk issues that might be apparent from discovery.  In the current case, joining up the two lots of discovery would have made it possible for another part of the organisation to identify the risk around communication without anyone in the programme or anybody involved in it saying it internally.  The externalising of the management of these cases, which has served other purposes usefully for the State, has led to a weakness in risk and management control inside the health service which we must now address.  The internal audit case management review which I have instigated to look at the failures to escalate this case, and at the fact that the issues were not identified and addressed quickly, will provide a pathway to do that.  This is not to criticise the State Claims Agency but to recognise that a lacuna has opened up in processes, which this case has really exposed.<\/p> <p>  Professor McKenna, who is providing clinical governance for the programme on an interim basis, indicated last week that he will be examining what enhancements can be made to the literature to promote a better understanding of the advantages, the risks, the disadvantages and what the screening programme cannot do.

A lot of inroads have been made into treating cancer in Ireland in recent years and it is regrettable that this has caused such damage.  There are people working in the service who have given a lot of their time to reducing the impact of cancer on people's lives.  There is an opportunity now for a new comprehensive programme for the reduction of the impacts of cervical cancer on people's lives.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that has led the women of Ireland to have a feeling betrayal is the title of the programme.

We were able to home in on that aspect of the structure of the HSE.  I think Deputy Kelly said that ten or 15 people, who are allegedly accountable, are involved in management positions.

It seems clear to me that when the people in charge have no clinical experience and no clinical involvement in the provision of services in a hospital or an organisation, there is a deficit when it comes to being able to relay down to what happens in real life.

The policy on open disclosure is not confined to regulated medical professionals.  There is an equal obligation, irrespective of the professional discipline from which a HSE staff member is drawn.  The Deputy's central point that members of a regulated or licensed profession are subject to professional disciplinary issue while others are not is a very valid point.  In the past I have spoken of this for two equal reasons, one of them being the Deputy's point that it would be beneficial if the profession of health management were to be recognised, both so that it would be valued and so that it would be subject to professional standards and so on.<\/p> <p>  In other jurisdictions - the Minister has mentioned one or two of them - including jurisdictions not too far from here, there is the notion of the \"fit and proper person\" test which can be applied at the point of appointment to a senior role.  It is not dissimilar from, but not exactly the same as, what has been introduced here in financial services in the past decade.  I believe what we somewhat disparagingly used to call health administrators provide a hugely important and central role, irrespective of whether they have a health professional background.  There would be value in examining how to regulate that as a professional in terms of the qualifications required, continuing professional development and adherence to standards in the way the Deputy has described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee this morning.

I was very interested in hearing about the sign he placed on his wall the day after he took up his new position.  I think he will have to agree that the sign did not work.  I find it hard to believe that he did not know, but I obviously take him at his word.  I have no reason not to do so.  However, he should have known; not knowing is nearly as bad as knowing and not doing anything about it.  As Deputy Donnelly has said, my party has called for him to step aside.  If he decides not to or if he is left in his position, I ask him at least to forego the annual leave he intends taking before he retires to at least see it through and maybe as a goodwill gesture.

As I asked Mr. O'Brien this question last week, perhaps the Minister can answer this week.  What can be done to restore the public's confidence in screening in general?  I think things were going very well but the public has lost huge confidence in this and it is hard to blame them.<\/p> <p>  What was called a helpline last week is now being called an information line.  \"Phoneline\" is probably the correct term to use because the feedback I am getting is that it just not working.

No, absolutely not.  It has been set up and is independent.  We will leave Dr. Scally and Dr. Denton to their work.  What I have heard from colleagues from all political parties and groupings and most importantly what I have heard from women who have been impacted by this was that they did not want us to hand this issue over to a commission or something that would go on forever and a day.  They wanted us to try to get as many answers as we could as quickly as we could and also identify the other issues that would require a commission.  Therefore, the Government decided yesterday that there will be a statutory commission of investigation.  The following questions will arise when Dr. Scally's work is concluded.  What questions have been satisfactorily answered?  What do we know the answers to?  What remains to be answered?<\/p> <p>  I also call it a phoneline.  I said this in the D&aacute;il last night and I know Mr. O'Brien has said it here today.  There is a view that people are not getting calls back because of resources.  That is genuinely not the truth.  I have been scrutinising this.  Many more people have been trained up to prepare the calls.  Women are ringing up with personal information and quite rightly wanting answers to their own clinical situation, which then often requires a clinician going off looking at the situation and then a nurse or doctor coming back.  A total of 3,649 of those calls have been concluded in the sense that the information has gone back.  Damien McCallion is here today.  I heard him give a public commitment that the overwhelming majority of them will be concluded by the end of this weekend and that is still the aim.<\/p> <p>  While I will not go into it in detail now, the Deputy hit the nail on the head in asking what we can do to build confidence now in a practical sense.  I met representatives of the Irish Cancer Society for about an hour last week.  They had some very practical logical things that I would like to do with them.  I would very much welcome any ideas.  The move to HPV testing will provide us with an opportunity to nearly restart the conversation with the women of Ireland.  It will also give us an opportunity to reconfigure labs and all of that.

That is being worked through and the daily statics show that it is progressing, not obviously as fast as we would like, but as well as it reasonably can.<\/p> <p>  In the issue of whether or not I was called, I want to quote that great philosopher, Deputy Alan Kelly, \"It's so bizarre and unbelievable that it must be true.\"  I believe that is what he said on a radio station last week.

I have indicated that I intend to push back the start of that period in order that I will definitely be around for the report on the scoping review.  However, I have also indicated to the Minister that, given that I will take leave later, it is highly unlikely I will return on 23 and 24 July, just as a matter of practicalities, and that, rather than appointing an acting director general, as the law provides, I will instead invite him, in the interests of the organisation, to appoint an interim director general from that day forward to avoid chopping and changing and uncertainty which the health service does not need at this time.

As the Minister and the director general know, this is not personal.  I have often repeated - in fact, I have said continuously - that I am not happy with the structures in place within the HSE in general, but that is not the fault of the staff.  The structures in place are not at all convincing in terms of the chain of command.  There is no chain of command, as this incident proves.  I presume the National Cancer Registry should be part of the chain of command and report to someone somewhere along the line.  Surely the reporting should continue along the line to someone at a senior level.  Who are the people at senior level to whom those reporting should report?  Why did they not report?  If the information was available to them at an earlier stage, why did they not convey it?  Furthermore, I still believe - the Minister knows this well from previous debates we have had here - that whatever changes are made as a result of what has happened should lead to the creation of a structure that will be accountable and seamless from top to bottom in order that information will flow immediately in both directions and in order that whoever is the director general or the Minister will be <i>au fait<\/i>with what is happening and required on the ground.

It does not operate within the HSE but is under the aegis of the Department of Health.  It does its work transparently, reports well and has done good service.  In this instance, there is a data protection issue which has been overcome.  The general data protection regulation, GDPR, which will come into force very soon will provide a particular route to overcome data protection issues.  The fault is not the National Cancer Registry Ireland's.  The issue is that information was given that the audit that had been carried out had involved the totality when it had not.  That is the basis on which the Minister was briefed and on which he briefed the House and the Government.  He was briefed incorrectly in the way I described when I was here last week.  Because it is a very serious matter if a Minister is misled, I made it absolutely clear, on behalf of the HSE, that any onward misleading was not the Minister's fault.<\/p> <p>  I have had occasion to discuss with the committee and others my views on the creation of the HSE and its structures.  I opposed the way in which it was created and worked very hard to keep the part of the organisation that I led out of it, but time caught up with me and it became part of the HSE.  The creation of the HSE, despite the many good things that go on within it - members have referred to some of them - was an exercise in how not to do change management.  From policy to implementation in 18 months, many of the underpinning factors described in the reports that proposed the creation of the HSE were never acted on and have still not been acted on.  I refer to having integrated financial systems and so on.  The Minister used the phrase, \"too big to fail and too big to succeed\".  That is right.  The notion that one person - me in this case, or my successor; I hope there will be strong competition for the post and I will certainly encourage people to apply for it, although at this points I have doubts about the competition - must be personally accountable for every failure and mistake of the 140,000 individuals who work in the health service is not a basis for accountability.  There are strong recommendations made in the Sl&aacute;intecare report that I have publicly supported in that regard.  As I have indicated before, I was appointed to an organisation that was to be wound down in the aftermath of the abolition of its board.  Three years in - I had a year before the five-year start - as it was clear that that would not happen, I started on a different course.  However, at some point - the fact that there is now all-party consensus proves this - we must have a settled position on the structures of the organisation, but in six years what have we done?

That is the policy.  By the way, while I believe the concept behind the HSE - having a national body to do all it has done; it has made some progress in a number of important areas - is a good one, the way in which it was set up has meant it has become overly complex and bureaucratic.

The figures are contained in the daily reports.  We triaged the 8,150 women who requested a callback into three categories: those who had a normal smear history; those who have had contact with colposcopy services; and those who have had an abnormal smear history.  Those calls are then moved to a number of different centres.  As of yesterday evening, 4,501 women were awaiting a callback.  It was clear to us last weekend that we would not get through this quickly with the resources and process we had.  We set up a centre in Waterford which solely deals with those who have had a normal smear history.  Such women still need reassurance and many will have questions and need advice from a person with a clinical background.  The second group, those who have had an abnormal smear history, need to talk to someone who has access to the cancer screening system.  Two centres to cater for that group have been set up in Dublin and Limerick.  The final group, who are probably those with the most questions, are those already in contact with the colposcopy service or who have some form of cancer.  We put a system in place with the hospitals such that the colposcopy units are now working with us to contact those women directly.  In many cases the units' staff know the women and will be able to give reassurance much more quickly than an operator at a central point who does not know the person could.  It also provides access to a pool of specialised resources that would be impossible to try to pull into a small number of sites.  As of yesterday, we had dealt with 1,000 callbacks.  Prior to last weekend, we had dealt with a number in the low hundreds.  Approximately 500 were dealt with on Saturday, 550 on Sunday and 700 on Monday.  The numbers are increasing.  We are not being absolute in terms of a final point because calls are still coming in.  The number of calls varies; there was a low number on Monday and slightly more calls yesterday.  That can sometimes be determined by the discussions going on around the cervical screening programme.<\/p> <p>  The point was made that the calls with women who have had an abnormal history or were in contact with services take time.  I have talked to some of the nurses and doctors staffing the helpline and we must give people time to deal with the calls.  We have ramped up resources such that we have probably got over 60 to 70 people at different times of the day working through these calls.  We must bear in mind that a colposcopy or cancer nurse or a doctor is required to deal with those women who have had contact with the service and we are drawing on the system to try to maximise that.  The people who have a normal smear history simply want to talk to someone who has a clinical background and can explain things to them in language that gives them a degree of reassurance.  We are continuing to try to get communications out through social media and other channels to give them some level of reassurance to those who have a normal smear history but in the current environment I expect that we will receive a significant number of calls this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien McCallion"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525852800,"counter":512,"content":"<p>That echoes a point made by Deputy O'Connell, that irrespective of whether there has been no previous screening history or one with no abnormality detected, the right course of action for any women experiencing symptoms such as unusual discomfort or bleeding is to seek a medical consultation with a general practitioner, which is likely to lead to a rapid referral to a colposcopy service.

There is almost an instinct not to publicise something that has gone wrong because to do so would add to the perception of poor service.

I was at the meeting of the committee last week and wished to pursue something he stated there.  Perhaps one of the other representatives present can answer my query.  Many people are talking about the plaque on the office wall at the HSE which is intended to send out a great message to the masses who work for it.  As regards speaking truth to power, Noam Chomsky, in a critique of how the system works, said that power already knows the truth and is busy concealing it.<\/p><p> Maybe it is best not to keep that plaque on the wall.  I note that while Mr. O'Brien was here, he said that not every case of cervical cancer was referred back to CervicalCheck for audit.  To quote, he said \"I think they always knew that\".  However, the Minister was only hit with that news 20 minutes before he got up to speak to the D&aacute;il.  Does he still have confidence in Mr. Tony O'Brien and others who are meant to be reporting to him? <\/p><p> I would just like to say that I am all for heads rolling and people being accountable, but there is also a danger that heads can roll while the system remains in place.  The questions I am more concerned with are about the system.  Yesterday, I asked about the anomalies in some of the lab results.  People on the committee will recall that when Mr. O'Brien was here last week, he said that there were two pairs of eyes watching every test.  On foot of that, a woman who was subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer contacted me over the weekend, because she was watching the committee.  People are actually watching this.  She was particularly interested in that, because she had two negative results, and then a year later was diagnosed with a large tumour.  She just found it very difficult to believe, based on what she had experienced, that there were two pairs of eyes looking.<\/p><p> I met a pathologist over the weekend.  He ran a cervical screening lab for at least a year.  He said that in his experience, each test would take at least ten minutes.  Ten to 15 would be the best recommendation.  That would mean that every slide in these labs is taking 20 to 30 minutes to be looked at, if we follow Mr. O'Brien's claim.  I would have liked to ask him if he still stands over that.  Every test is signed off on by a cytologist.  Can we check how many were done by each cytologist?  Are they within the limit of 12,000 a year that is recommended by CervicalCheck's quality assurance?  The quality assurance committee - what were they doing if they were not looking at, for example, what is up on the website now?  I think it went up on Saturday evening.  In reference to the three labs, A, B and C, people have figured out that B is the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, A is Medlab Pathology and C is Quest Diagnostics.  There are noticeable differences in the results over the three years.  Without blinding people with science, that is particularly so for lower-grade abnormalities.

Will the document that the Minister mentioned today, the international clinical expert review, include people who were audited as well?  Yes?  Will their cases also be looked at?

The Deputy also made a detailed submission to me about the terms of reference.  I have tried to capture that in item f. of the terms of reference, whereby we have asked Dr. Scally and Dr. Denton, who know a lot about this as opposed to me as a non-clinician, to \"examine the tendering, contracting, operation, conflict of interest arrangements, performance information and performance management, accreditation and quality assurance of contracted cytology laboratory services by CervicalCheck from initiation of the programme\".<\/p> <p>  All of those issues, the operation of each of those labs and how it relates to the programme will be looked at to provide answers.

My first comment is that I think we should never miss the opportunity to get some benefit from this crisis.  There is an opportunity here, because what has become apparent and blatant in the last few days is that the culture of non-disclosure and covering up is never acceptable and is never the right option.  I think that message has to go very clearly to all employees in the HSE.  If something goes wrong, they should put their hands up.  The outcome of that will always be better than pretending that it did not happen.  In future, if every arm of that organisation operates on that basis, issues such as this, while they will always be difficult, will always be dealt with in a far more progressive manner.<\/p> <p>  I have just a couple of specific questions.  There is talk of a new, more accurate human papillomavirus, HPV-based screening technique.  When will that be available instead of what is there at the moment?  I am just wondering whether, if there is a more accurate and better test, it would be better to concentrate on that rather than continuing what we have, which has a degree of uncertainty about it.  With regard to patients who have had previous high-risk or non-clear tests, is there a targeted campaign to contact those women to say they should be tested again or are we leaving it up the women themselves to come back and say that they want to be re-tested?  My opinion is that we should target them as opposed to waiting for them to come to us, because people's nature is to hope that there is no problem, to turn a blind eye and hope it goes away.<\/p><p>There is an onus on us to contact any potentially high risk patient and to ask her to come back in for another look.<\/p><p> Last night I raised the issue of the succession of the CEO of the HSE.  In his contribution just five minutes ago, Mr. Tony O'Brien said that he doubted there would be much interest or uptake by anybody because of the nature of the organisation and the difficulties around the role.  It would, however, be nice to know a month or two before the current director general leaves if there is interest in the job.  If there was no interest then what could be done to attract people and what head hunting would be required? By the time we find somebody and by the time he or she gives notice, we are certainly looking at a six-month period.  There is a lesson to be learned in that.  This applies not only to the recruitment of CEO positions but across all positions in the HSE.  There should be a much better succession planning system in place when trying to replace administrators, doctors, consultants and nurses.  That clearly is not there.  There is a lesson to be learned in trying to improve this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#M01500","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I take Deputy Brassil's point on the last issue.

It will become apparent in due course that there has been a body of work to try to align this post with the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.

I will refer this directly to CervicalCheck and to Damien McCallion.  I will ask him to come back to the committee directly on that.  The Deputy has made an important point but I would rather the committee received an expert view on it rather than my view.  The plan is to move towards HPV testing around October this year.  In February this year I approved the introduction of primary HPV screening for cervical smear samples.  I did so on the basis of a HIQA health technology assessment, which found that women would benefit by making the screening process more clinically effective and by reducing unnecessary tests for women.  This would be a more effective system that would need to test women less often.  This will be beneficial all around.  I have asked how quickly can we get there and I have been told that October is as ambitious as we can possibly be.  I continue to scrutinise that situation because the quicker we can get there the better.  Ireland will be one of the first countries in the world to move to introduce this type of testing.

Then I will move on to a question on non-registered consultants.  Yesterday, a High Court judge described that situation as scandalous.<\/p> <p>  I wish address the issue of CervicalCheck first.  I believe there is an opportunity to be proactive in identifying high-risk women.  We have been speaking to general practitioners throughout the country.  The point was made to us that the inverse care law may apply here.  In other words, those most likely to contact the centre and go for further screening are not necessarily those most likely to need it.  In one conversation relayed to me a general practitioner talked to women in his practice who he believed should have repeat screening.  They said they were fine and that the GP should not worry about it.  There is an opportunity to identify and target higher-risk women and proactively reach out to them.  The idea is not simply to have a woman contact her GP and self-select or contact the helpline.  We should be more proactive about it.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister tighten up the guidelines for GPs?  I have been contacted by several GPs.  They say the information they have to date is insufficient.  They have been told to use their clinical judgment.  That is fine but I believe many of them are looking for a little more in terms of when it is appropriate or otherwise when it comes to different types of clinical advice.<\/p> <p>  I wish to address the preliminary investigation.  I did not put this point in my submission to the Minister.  I am suggesting something new.  It relates to the fact that the investigation will be looking at the activities of the Department of Health and the Minister.  My understanding is that it will include the period from when the Department knew about Vicky Phelan's case and sent the memorandum to the Minister and so forth.  There is a clear conflict in reporting into the Minister or the Department on that basis.  Will the Minister consider a reporting line into the Department of the Taoiseach?  I appreciate that I should have raised the matter before the Minister brought it to Cabinet, but I will leave it with the Minister.<\/p> <p>  It would be useful to get a report on laboratory accuracy.  There is considerable concern that the US laboratories may have been substandard and that the Irish laboratories were substandard.  The HSE has released documentation.  The HSE released it on Saturday but with insufficient explanation on the values.  For example, if we use positive predictive value, it would appear that in two of the years the Irish-based laboratory was the least accurate.  If we use the number of anomalies detected, it would appear the same laboratory was the most accurate.  I am seeking expert advice on the matter myself but I believe a clarifying note from the Department or the HSE would be useful.<\/p> <p>  This is a political point for the Minister and for the Taoiseach as well.  There is still considerable confusion as to the link between non-disclosure and clinical outcomes.  I am talking to women who still believe that the issue of non-disclosure has led to women's deaths.  My understanding from talking to consultants is that while that cannot be ruled out, in fact it is not the case.<\/p> <p>  When Storm Ophelia arrived, every time I turned on the television the Taoiseach was on the screen flanked by soldiers and rescue workers.  He has not been out in the same way on this.  This is a national emergency just like Storm Ophelia in terms of the level of fear and misunderstanding.  Will the Minister talk to his boss and suggest that he show the same zeal for communicating with the public on this?  Perhaps he does not believe it would be as good a photo opportunity to be standing beside the HSE officials at the moment.  I am being somewhat tongue-in-cheek but there is a marked difference between how much he appeared on our television screens during Storm Ophelia and how we are seeing him on this issue.<\/p> <p>  Either the Minister can or cannot respond to any of these questions.  I am making them as points so the Minister can feel free in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask the Minister on an issue described by a High Court judge yesterday as scandalous.  There are well in excess of 100 doctors in Ireland working as consultants but who are not in fact consultants.  It amounts to approximately one in 25 doctors in consultant posts in the country.  On top of the CervicalCheck scandal, which has obviously shaken confidence, we have an issue described as scandalous by the courts.  It seems a patient may not know whether the consultant he or she is seeing is in fact a registered consultant.  What is the Minister's view on that?  Does he believe it is acceptable?  My understanding is that this has been going on for some time.  We got evidence last week at committee that there is genuine clinical risk attached to this practice.  What is the Minister's view on it?  What, if anything, does the Minister intend to do to stop this practice?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#O00800","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for his questions.

The HSE has asked Professor Frank Murray to do a discrete piece of work this year to work through how this situation can be regularised.  I am told that some of it relates to people who may never have joined the specialist register of the Medical Council, but may be well qualified to do so, which is completely unacceptable.

Since 2008, the HSE has required consultants to be on the relevant specialist division of the Medical Council's register of medical practitioners.  This is a means of ensuring consultants in Ireland have the necessary training, skills, competencies and qualifications.  As of April 2018, the position with regard to what the Deputy has asked about is that 4.3%, or approximately one in 25, of the 3,000-strong consultant workforce in the South is not on the specialist register.  Of the 127 individuals who are not on the register, 52 relate to the period before the requirement was introduced in 2008 and 75 relate to the period after 2008.  As the committee discussed last week, processes are ongoing to identify the consultants who were in their posts before 2008 and who have the necessary skills to be on the relevant register but have not yet chosen to put themselves forward for inclusion on it, and to encourage them to do so.  Processes are also in place to upskill, as required, those other pre-2008 consultants to bring them to the necessary standard.  I hope Professor Murray has given the committee further details in that regard.  The process for post-2008 individuals is largely a consequence of the inevitable delays that are experienced when we try to fill posts within the system, whether on the hospital side of the house or on the mental health side of the house.  Those delays are probably - almost certainly - too long at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Professor Murray will work with relevant colleagues in relevant agencies to look at options to reduce the amount of time it takes to fill a post after it is created as a new post, or becomes vacant and is identified as needing to be filled.  This will remain an issue in light of the pattern of services we have in Ireland at present.  There are some posts that are difficult to fill, unfortunately.  This becomes one of the symptoms of that challenge.  I am from the North, where we have exactly the same difficulty because certain posts at some of the smaller sites are harder to fill.  As I alluded to in my opening remarks, one way of beginning to provide additional assurances in this respect and getting around the recruitment difficulty is to provide for better networking when smaller sites are joined into the smaller sites.  In cases in which we have difficulties because of individuals in posts who are not on the specialist register, I assure the committee that appropriate assurances and governance arrangements are in place in community healthcare organisations and hospital groups to provide the necessary scrutiny of their day-to-day practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dean Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sullivan.

We understand that they are ill, but how many are terminally ill?<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask about the information that was communicated to the HSE by the State Claims Agency.  I understand that at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the State Claims Agency advised that all ten cases were known to the HSE and that there is some way in which quarterly reports are given.  The Minister might tell us how all of this slipped through the net.  Are there quarterly reports?  If so, who gets them and where do they go?  When I listened back to the proceedings of the joint committee, it was not clear to me how that would be communicated.<\/p> <p>  In Sinn F&eacute;in's submission regarding the inquiry, we suggested that while the non-statutory inquiry is under way, the time available could be used to work on reforming the legislation that governs commissions of inquiry to make it more fit for purpose.  This is needed to give us the capacity to put together a bespoke inquiry that might get some answers.<\/p> <p>  My view of the impact of outsourcing on quality is well known.  As a result of how seriously people in the trade union movement have taken the issue of outsourcing, a clause in the public service agreement, with which I am sure everyone present is familiar, requires consultation.  The Minister might give his view on what is happening in the Mater Hospital at present with regard to the central sterile services department.  It is particularly unfortunate that this issue has arisen at a time when we are facing the spectre of outsourcing and the potential that it might not have delivered for patients.  I do not say that to scare anyone, I say it because the potential is there.  It might not have served patients well.<\/p><p>It strikes me as somewhat counter-intuitive that there is a headlong rush into outsourcing, contrary to the term of the PSSA.<\/p><p> Last week, we discussed consultants.  I have no sense that the HSE is doing anything other than counting and trying to reclassify them.  As we sit here, a consultant somewhere who is probably not entitled to be on the specialist register is drawing down specialist wages and about to embark on his or her journey towards a contract of indefinite duration.  I do not think anyone in the HSE is trying to stop that.  As part of the recruitment process, is the HSE actively trying to recruit people from the specialist register or is it happy to allow the practice to which I refer continue?  I do not see it diminishing.<\/p><p> My final question relates to the Central Mental Hospital, CMH, a place which is well known to me for work reasons rather than any other, I hasten to add, and the practice of clients of the hospital going directly from court to it when they have been found not guilty by reason of insanity.  The CMH does not have the required staff.  Can our guests provide an indication of the number of people who have been turned away and who should have been provided with places in the CMH for specialist treatment?  Can they give us an idea of what services within the HSE those people are availing of and whether they are out on bail at the moment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#P01300","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I will start.  I noted seven questions.  If I missed any, I ask Deputy O'Reilly to let me know.  I will ask the HSE to start with most of them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of posters.  I thank her for her comments.  The Deputy and I obviously have the same view on this issue - heaven forbid we might have the same view on any other.  Largely speaking and regardless of one's view on the issue, the campaign had been pretty civil.  There are a few cases where that has not been the case.  What happened in my constituency with my image yesterday and the posters placed around my office and near my home and my family's home was a very low blow and kind of disgusting.  It was very upsetting for parents and families.  I do not think it is a fair reflection of the decent people who will be voting \"No\" or \"Yes\".  It was disgusting and should be condemned by everybody.  I regret that, so far, it has not been and I would like visible condemnation of it from all sides because we do not need the final two weeks of the campaign on this very sensitive and important matter to be dogged by such issues.<\/p> <p>  When we engaged last week, the Deputy asked me about the terms of reference for the scoping inquiry and reforming  current legislation to examine how we could have what the Deputy called a bespoke inquiry or investigation.  I have raised the matter with colleagues.  The legislation resides in justice.  I have made a couple of initial inquiries about whether a commission can hold any of its hearings in public.  There seems to be a viewpoint that the commission possibly can do so at the discretion of its chair.  We have a few weeks between now and the end of June before we get into a commission of investigation and I will use that time to work with the Opposition.  It is obviously outside my direct ministerial remit, but I will work with Government colleagues to see what a bespoke investigation could look like.<\/p> <p>  I certainly do not wish to speak for everyone, but my sense is that we are all agreed that we do not want to go down the road of a big tribunal which will go on for ever and which involves very sick women.  That is not appropriate.  The commission of investigation could produce a much quicker outcome in that regard, but it needs to be modular.  Deputy Kelly reminds me of that all the time and we have included the word \"modular\" in the terms of reference of the scoping inquiry.  We also need to see whether people who want to give testimony in public can be facilitated.  We need to tease out a few issues in that regard.

There could be difficulties in maintaining out-of-hours cover if a particular post could not be maintained or filled.  Sometimes we have no choice.

I understand acute hospitals are being prioritised.<\/p> <p>  There are issues relating to paediatric services in Dublin, particularly in Tallaght.  The paediatric emergency service area has been taken over.  The provision of beds for paediatric patients is not what it was.  I understand that there are other issues in terms of elective surgery for paediatric patients.  I know of one 13 year old boy who has Down's syndrome and who has been in desperate need of a hip replacement for two years.  He has begged me to help him.  His family have asked for my help.  The young lad is in serious pain.  There has been messing around going on for a significant period, which leads me to think that there are issues there.  I have been in touch with the general manager.  Are there broader issues with paediatric services?<\/p> <p>  On cervical screening, I thank the Minister for taking what I said on board.  Random sampling is necessary given the scale of the issue and concern in order to give a quick follow through in terms of public confidence.<\/p><p>With regard to the HTA for the HPV for boys, HIQA needs to come through ASAP.  The third thing is that I believe the HPV process relating to the new screening needs to be brought forward as quickly as possible and to deal upfront with the issues relating to laboratories and IT because they are the issues that would hold it up.  <\/p><p> I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach yesterday where the State Claims Agency told us that unless the laboratories give indemnity on these ten cases, and there will be more, the agency has no choice but to continue as part of the process of pursuing these women.  This may require emergency legislation to allow the State Claims Agency to change tack because it is actually confined in what it can do.  Will the Minister bring that to Cabinet and consider an emergency change?  I am sure all of us would help him to change that to ensure the State Claims Agency does not have to be part of pursuing these women.  <\/p><p> I return to my main issue.  We know that last week, 1,482 cases were reviewed as part of CervicalCheck.  We also know that there were issues with scans in 209 of those, of which 162 were not notified.  We know that as a consequence, unfortunately, 17 women died.  We now know that 100,621 cases from National Cancer Registry Ireland were not given to CervicalCheck.  We now know from Tony O'Brien that this was known for years.  I understand that National Cancer Registry Ireland has been writing to the Department for years.  There are two critical questions that need to be answered immediately.  We need to find out when the Department knew this and if or why it did not do anything.  The real issue was if it was 14, 82, 209 and 17, when will we know the proportionality regarding the number of cases?  I accept the number will be smaller because it probably involves older women, many of whom may not have been screened, although many of whom were.  What proportion of women have been not told?  What is the comparable figure to 2009 for these women?  Unfortunately, women's lives were put at risk.  It correlates.  Women's lives were put at risk so the bottom line is the fact that National Cancer Registry Ireland, which I believe is a good organisation, requested or tried to transfer these cases to CervicalCheck and was unable to do so probably because of data protection rubbish.  CervicalCheck was trying to get these cases from National Cancer Registry Ireland.  A total of 1,621 cases were not part of the audit.  As a consequence of that, we do not know how many of those cases had issues with the way in which they were surveyed and smeared and we also do not know how many of those cases jeopardised women's lives and potentially, women who passed away.

Of those, a large proportion probably got cancer directly and were not part of the screening process.  There is also a proportion that was part of a screening process or some process through various other pathways and avenues.  The fact that this information was not part of the audit meant that if there were issues, and proportionately we must work off the other set of figures, some of those women may have had issues relating to screening which as a consequence were not being picked in the subsequent audit and did not get interventions so their lives were put at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#R02500","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525852800,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I do not understand that.

I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments.  I acknowledge the work that he plans to do in respect of respite, with extra houses being built, etc.  Is there anything else he can do?  There is a particular need for respite for people over 18 years of age who have special needs.  I acknowledge the work done by carers and family members.<\/p><p> I had a question for the Minster of State, Deputy Jim Daly, on the fair deal scheme, but I will talk to him later about that.

The \"Jeep for Jason\" fundraiser was organised by local people. It shows that there is a need for more front-line workers.  If Mr. Sullivan is praising such workers, he might also mention the volunteers who helped during Storm Emma.<\/p><p> My final question is for the Minister.  Many people, including GPs, are concerned about the practicalities of what will happen if the \"Yes\" vote is successful in the referendum.  The health system is already stretched, as are GPs.

It is a stretch in terms of the remit of this committee but I am happy to answer it.  I love debating this issue.  It is an important issue and it is vital that we get the facts and the information out.  There is no need - when I am in the middle of dealing with a cervical cancer scandal and trying to reassure women - for people to turn up with an empty podium outside Leinster House and ask where I am and why have I not turned up for the debate.  People might be aware that there was quite a lot on last week.  I had other priorities relating to women's healthcare, but I look forward to debating.  Our national broadcaster has scheduled a number of debates over the next couple of weeks.  I will take part in at least one of them, subject to being invited and that the broadcaster is happy I am not representing the \"Yes\" campaign.  There are many people in many political parties and many civil society groups and campaigns.  I very much welcome the opportunity to debate.  I say this in all sincerity.  The tone of the debates I have seen so far have been respectful and, hopefully, informative for people.  I hope we continue in that vein.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy makes an important point on the issue of the GP service.  If the people of Ireland vote \"No\", nothing changes.  We understand that.  If the people of Ireland vote \"Yes\", the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 will remain the law of the land until new legislation is introduced.  I have published the heads of a Bill as to what I propose putting to the D&aacute;il.  There will be a period during which my Department will engage with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, as would normally be the case.  Both of those institutions will draw up clinical guidelines.  The Deputy and I have a different perspective on this.  I respect that.  I note that many GPs are also in favour of this issue.

Before I go into the assessment of needs and the respite care services, I want to be associated with what many of my colleagues said in respect of the poster put up outside the constituency office of the Minister.  That was appalling and disgraceful behaviour and it does not have any part in any campaign.  I offer my support to the Minister.  From a personal and family point of view, what happened was totally out of order.<\/p> <p>  On the assessment of needs, as the Deputy correctly stated, there is a provision in this regard in the Disability Act 2005.  We accept that the HSE figures show there has been a huge increase in the number of applications.  I think it is in the region of 6,000.  We accept that we are facing huge challenges in meeting the statutory timeframes.  That is the reality.  We have also come across very complex cases.  We have, however, started acting in respect of the delays.<\/p> <p>  We are doing three major things.  We are putting in place a comprehensive plan of individual measures in each community healthcare organisation, CHO, area.  We are also putting in place a new standard operational procedure for the assessment of needs.  That is being implemented and is ongoing.  The objective is to improve the efficiency and operation of the assessment of needs process and the position with regard to compliance rates.  On the broader issue, reconfiguration of the disability services is taking place as part of the progressing disability services for children and young people programme.  We also have integrated teams that are operating well and the assessment of needs process runs more smoothly in that situation.  Finally, because of the problems we are having, we are also carrying out a policy review of the assessment of needs process.  I intend to report back to the committee in future on this issue.  That to which I refer is something we have done in respect of this issue and I intend to focus on it the context of the Estimates for 2019.<\/p> <p>  On respite, as has been acknowledged, we managed to secure an extra &euro;10 million.  The work in this regard has already started.  I opened a beautiful respite house beside the sea in Balbriggan last week.  The staff there are great.  In the context of the funding, &euro;8 million will be used to provide nine new dedicated houses for respite in each community area.  The remaining &euro;2 million will be used for respite based on home-sharing and also for day options for respite services for people with special needs.  We will also be adding the option of home support services for respite.  Some families have told us that because of the high level of need experience by children or young adults with disabilities, rather than sending them, it is easier to have the respite care provided in their homes and then their family members take a break.<\/p> <p>  A wide variety of respite services are on offer.  I thank the Minister for his great support on this.  A couple of months ago, we listened to people, we talked to families and we accepted that there was a crisis in the context of respite.  We had to get an additional &euro;10 million to deal with that.  The work has started.  In the negotiations that will take place during the summer months and in the debate on the Estimates, it is essential that we deal with the issue of supporting children and adults with disabilities, whether in the context of the assessment of needs or the provision of quality services.<\/p> <p>  As regards broader disability services, we already have &euro;1.772 billion going into social care services.  We have seen massive increases in services.  We accept, however, that we have a long way to go but we have started the process.  Two years ago, I had three central objectives: first, to reform the services; second, to invest in the services; and, third - the new dimension and in line with the UN convention - to put people with disabilities at the centre of the services.  That work has begun and we are gradually making progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#S00500","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I have four questions.  The first one is on the funding that organisations get.  Many organisations are almost 100% funded.  My point is that a culture can develop of \"We are paying you and we own you\".  That is putting it very bluntly.  I thank the Minister for his earlier reply.  I asked a question about the protocols and steps that are in place within in the HSE to mitigate the risk of that to which I refer happening.  Is there full governance respect for organisations with which the HSE has service level agreements?<\/p><p>The reply set out many of the things relating to legal contracts and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform statement and circular.  I do not get a reassurance or a sense that the response has struggled with the question of what protocols are in place to protect against that happening.  I will leave it at that.  However, I am in close contact with the organisations and I know that when they read this, they will not feel reassured by it.  They will say that they know there are service level agreements and so forth but that is about compliance and the sense that there is a lived respect for the autonomy of the organisations.  As charities, they are public benefit organisations and they are first cousins to their public sector counterparts.  However,  the attitude is, \"Look, you are getting the money from us and whatever\".  It is a quandary but I would like the Minister and his Department to respond further on this.<\/p><p> My next question relates to employment retention.  I am very annoyed about this and about the section 38 and section 39 organisations.  The Department and the HSE knew about this issue well over a year ago when the organisations were trotting to the Workplace Relations Commission one by one.  Union representatives were there sitting beside the employers and the question being asked was, \"Where is the money?\".  There is an issue, and on some occasions the HSE was dragged into some of those discussions.  I raised this matter a year ago at this committee and I also raised it in the Seanad with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, at the same time.  Last January, we received confirmation that an exercise was being undertaken by the HSE with a number of the organisations.  What is the current position and will there soon be a satisfactory solution?  The only figure I have been given is that 50 of the grant-aided organisations are involved.  A questionnaire was sent out to the organisations and it was to be returned by the end of March, which is six weeks ago.  What is happening now?  When will the exercise be concluded?<\/p><p> The core issue is that I can name two organisations, one a section 38 organisation and one a section 39 organisation, that are working in the same county and with the same client group.  As regards section 38 organisations being different from section 39 organisations, they are in the way they are constructed under the Act but it is very hard to see a difference in the way they are providing services and support.  One of the organisations I mentioned is now acting as a cheap recruiter and trainer for the other and the staff are being churned and moved around.  This must be resolved.  I am getting a strong sense of it being put on the long finger and I am not happy about that.<\/p><p> My next question relates to personal assistance.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I have had the abacus out on a number of occasions to break down the hours and so forth.  The HSE is clearly stating what was a matter of fact - from the figures it had in any event - which is that the average number of hours per week is less than 12.  That is an average of one hour and 42 minutes per day.  The definition we have been given is that the role of the personal assistant is to assist an individual with a disability to maximise his or her independence through supporting him or her to live in an integrated setting and to access community facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#S00700","speaker":"1419","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to concentrate on the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#T00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I am on my third of four questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#T00300","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Yes, but we need to have the answers as well within the seven minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#T00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":640,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat. The definition being used in 2016 was that it was to enable the person to live an independent life.  How in the name of God can the Minister of State deliver on that definition, even if he calls it in-home support, if the person is getting an average of less than two hours per day?  It is impossible.  It is not personal assistance and it is a lie to present it as such.  Some 2,000 of the 2,500 are getting less than an average of 20 hours per week.  For God's sake, call a spade and spade, go back to the drawing board and develop a personal assistance.  How many people are on the waiting list?<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to regulatory compliance.  I will be brief.  There have been some increases in funding, but they are modest in terms of what needs to happen.  The Minister admits this.  The Charities Act, HIQA and a range of other things, none of them to be decried, were put in place during the recession, which is interesting.  However, there has been no extra funding.  Along with taking cuts, organisations were told to ensure that services were not reduced.  They were told that they must hold the line.  The Department made a cut of 5% in 2010 and told the organisations to get on with it and maintain the same level of services.  That is a fact.  Increased compliance has been shoved in there as well, which is another bubble.  There is no acknowledgement of that in terms of the reasonable costs that are involved in it.<\/p> <p>  I accept that the Minister and others will not have time to respond fully on my questions, but I would like to have further engagement on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#T00500","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I will deal with the personal assistance hours.

They are now asking that their names be removed from the charts.  Even though the patients are assigned to the consultants, the consultants are not being given the opportunity to review the scans before they go to the central unit.  Will that issue be dealt with?  The delegates might not be aware of it but it is an issue in the smaller maternity units around the country that are joined to bigger maternity units that are in charge of rolling out the system for the anomaly scans.  The consultants want to be involved but they are being excluded from the process, yet their names are on top of the patients' charts.<\/p> <p>  My second issue, concerning the State Claims Agency and claims, follows on from the issue raised by Deputy Alan Kelly.  I understand that, without legislation, the State Claims Agency could reach a solution in regard to some claims but still step into the shoes of the claimant and go after the company that represents the laboratory.  Might that be addressed?  Deputy Kelly raised a very valid issue in this regard.  I am not clear that it requires a change to legislation as there may be a process available already.<\/p> <p>  The third issue I want to raise concerns consultant recruitment.  It is a significant issue concerning planning.  In the reply to a question I tabled on the number of consultants in place, the number of vacancies and the need for planning, I was advised that approximately 59 consultants are expected to retire over the next 12 months.  That is an underestimate.  I am saying that because, if there are 2,930 consultants and the average consultant stays in the system for around 20 years, and even if there is a 5% reduction every year, 146 will retire naturally every year.  I am wondering about the planning process.  It is very difficult to get consultants and we are not advertising many positions until they become vacant.  I have raised this consistently over the past three to four years in respect of planning.  The HSE's estimate that 59 will retire is an underestimate, and we are not on top of this issue.  For a recent obstetrics and gynaecology position advertised in Portiuncula Hospital, there was no applicant.  Therefore, we really need to plan.  We are not doing enough.  The estimate of 59 is wrong.  An average of 150 will retire every year.  We need to fast-track the process to address this because services will fall down unless we are able to plan.<\/p> <p>  The other issue regarding consultant contracts concerns the terms being offered.  We are now competing with all the other jurisdictions not only in regard to what we are offering, but also in regard to a tax system.  In the United Kingdom, for instance, one can earn up to &pound;45,000 before being taxed at the higher rate.  In Ireland, the figure is between &euro;34,000 and &euro;35,000.  Therefore, one is competing with other jurisdictions on different issues.  We need to be conscious of that aspect.<\/p> <p>  The only other issue I want to raise concerns the GP contract negotiations and whether we have now started the process in regard to them.  Have we set targets for making some progress on this matter?  In fairness to GPs, they are now stepping into the breach and providing considerable backup support in regard to the cervical screening process.  We need them on board.  I am wondering how fast we can expedite this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#U00400","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I will start and Mr. O'Sullivan might take questions that relate to the HSE.<\/p> <p>  On the State Claims Agency issue, the point the Senator makes is exactly the sort of point we need to be teasing through.

It is a question of how we can get ourselves to a position whereby liability rests in the correct place legally and the State does not end up in an adversarial position in relation to women in this country.  We do not want to be in that position.  That is what the Government is teasing its way through.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the GP contract, engagement has commenced.  I have said on a number of occasions, and must state again, that I do not intend to provide a running commentary on this, although I am not suggesting the Senator is asking me for one.  We would be the worst negotiators in the history of the State if we were to give one.  There are many millions of euro extra that the Government wants to spend in general practice that I have agreed with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Taoiseach.  We would like to commence some of the additional expenditure this year and we would like to increase significantly the expenditure for 2019, 2020 and 2021.  The Senator knows the issues that need to be examined are manifold.  I know that from the perspective of those in general practice, it involves the issue of FEMPI.  I heard that very loudly and clearly at the IMO conference.  I heard it from the National Association of General Practitioners also.  The engagement is under way very actively.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the timeframe, I do not wish to state one publicly because that weakens the hand of those in the room acting on behalf of the State but we are very eager to make progress very quickly.

That takes us back to the discussion we were having earlier on recruitment processes and the centrality of Professor Murray's rule in terms of trying to speed things up a little.  If we know a post is going to become vacant because of a retirement on date X, we really should be working backwards from that to ensure the gap is a small as possible.  That is related to, but different from, the workforce planning issue.  Clearly, we can fill posts from within the local workforce.  In that regard, we need to have coming off the training conveyor belt enough new registrars to become consultants and so on.  We also need to try to fish in other ponds.

My understanding is that in Portiuncula there is no proper 3-D scanning unit, or whatever it is called.  I refer to the fancy scan a woman gets at 20 or 22 weeks.  About a year ago this committee heard from Professor Louise Kenny from University College Cork.  She outlined that the anomalies pop up in the population group where one would not expect them.  From memory, I think she said they emerge at a rate of about one a week.  Conditions that one would not associate with a 28-year-old mother, for example, happen at about that rate.  There is no way of detecting them if there are no machines to do so.  Do the witnesses get what I am saying?  I would like to make that point.  If a woman is never scanned, she will never know, and it is only when the baby starts coming out that the doctor realises the problem.<\/p> <p>  While I am commenting on Portiuncula, I note that the report is shocking.  I am not too shocked by it, because I know of a number of cases in that part of the country.  I would like to ask whoever is in charge, perhaps Mr. Sullivan at this moment, if they would be happy for any member of their family to have a baby in Portiuncula hospital.  The impact of catastrophic events at birth extend a long way beyond the impact on the baby.  There tends to be an emergency section.  There tend not to be ideal circumstances for a section to be carried out.  It tends to be a large section; it tends to have repercussions when it comes to women's health thereafter, including both forms of incontinence, adhesions, and impacts on people's personal lives, sex lives and relationships.  I have not read the report yet because I have been too busy with other things.  However, I have heard statements here this morning.  Looking at it as a woman who has been engaged in the maternity services for the last ten years, I am concerned about any babies being born under these circumstances and any woman presenting themselves.  I wonder if Mr. Sullivan or whoever would be happy for somebody belonging to them to be born there.<\/p> <p>  I know that Mr. O'Brien has left now, but when he came before the committee he mentioned difficulties with one person being at the head of the service.  I do not want to misquote him.  He did not think it was possible, or thought that people would not apply for the job.  My understanding is that Mr. O'Brien has been in that job for six years.  I am wondering if the Department has any correspondence from Mr. O'Brien, or if anybody has such correspondence, where he indicated that he did not think it was possible for one person to do the job.  It seems to me that we heard that today, in light of all that has come out, but he did apply for a job that he deemed himself qualified for.  Somebody gave him the job.  I do not want to misquote him, and we can go back and check the record.  However, what I took from what he said was that this is too big a job for one person.  When he referred to what a big job it is for one person, was he referring to the management of the organisational structure of the HSE, or is he talking about the population it is in charge of?  I would like to remind Mr. Sullivan that the population of Ireland is comparable with that of Manchester.  How could anyone say that it is too big to manage when it happens in other countries?  I am quite concerned about those statements this morning, in light of Mr. O'Brien's six years in the job.  If someone came into a job said that it was too much after six months, I could understand it.  However, it seems a bit confusing at this point in the conversation.<\/p> <p>  I wish to return to the issue of open disclosure, with reference to the cervical screening situation.  Mr. O'Brien referred to the open disclosure practice of the HSE non-clinical staff.  Is there any letter or any record of any non-clinical staff member being told that open disclosure would apply to them?  Regarding the health administrator role being subject to regulation, which I spoke about in my first contribution, has this just started today, or is it in train?  I refer to health administrators or whatever we want to call them, non-clinical people who are in a position of authority.  Is it envisaged that the regulation would be on a statutory footing?  Doctors very much do not like going in front of the Medical Council.  It tends to be quite complex and can be very difficult for people.  If we are going to make people accountable, are they actually going to be properly accountable?  Will it be on a statutory footing, and will it have real teeth?  <\/p> <p>  Regarding the terms of reference, I refer to part f.  I went through these in detail last night.  Term f. seems to have an awful lot of stuff shoved into one term of reference.  It deals with tendering, contracting, operation, conflict of interest arrangements, performance information, performance management, accreditation and quality assurance.  An awful lot seems to be contained in term f.  To me, it is really important going forward, as opposed to looking back, that the data we are getting back from places is of value to us when we are studying our population data. <\/p> <p>  Finally I wish to raise the plan for human papillomavirus, HPV, testing that the HSE already had before this happened.  Will the HSE now look at the HPV plan with a new lens in light of what has happened?  Are we now looking at a new way of going about this, and when will we have a picture of what sort of plan that will be? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#V00800","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":671,"content":"<p>On the topic of Portiuncula, from my reading of the report I would firstly sympathise with the families who have been tragically impacted by this, many of whom I have heard comment in the media, and all of whom I know were offered briefings in relation to this piece of work, to look into what went wrong in Portiuncula.  I think it is important to say, however, for women who may be using our maternity services today, that objectively a lot has changed since then.  I welcome the fact that the Chair might do a separate engagement on this, because there is a lot that we could discuss.  If one looks at the number of consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, nurses, or midwives in Portiuncula, one sees they have all significantly increased.  There was no director of midwifery, assistant director of midwifery or national maternity strategy.  There now is.  That is not to suggest in any manner or means that the job is done.  Deputy O'Connell knows the area of our national maternity strategy very well.  However, I would point out that a lot of the recommendations made in the Portiuncula report are already very much under way.<\/p><p>I took some assurance that from a great tragedy, and a failure, very positive, concrete actions were taken.  <\/p><p> I am not going to speak for the director general or offer an interpretation of what he said today.  I believe the way the HSE was established was not appropriate.  It seems that is acknowledged by everybody in these Houses now, and by most people in the HSE.  What are we going to do to fix it?  If we bring forward the HSE board legislation next week, it will be a start.  We then need to move as quickly as possible to the roadmap for these regional integrated structures, or whatever they will be called.  We need to see the community health organisations and the hospital groups working together.  There has to be a couple of them around the country, with the country divided up into several areas which have local accountability and devolved structures.  That is where we need to get to, and I expect to be in a position to bring that roadmap to Government this year so that we can actually map it out.  <\/p><p> On the issue of accountability, I have heard it from many people - Ms R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy has said it to me previously - that if something goes wrong in the health service, the doctor is accountable to the Medical Council.  Nurses are accountable at the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, but to whom is the manager accountable?  Accountability does not mean that heads must roll, but it means professional development and regulatory structures.  I believe that many people working in the HSE would welcome that, but how that is legislated for is something with which we will have to grapple.  I started a piece of work on this issue a couple of weeks ago, before the latest CervicalCheck situation arose.  I know that this committee is very busy, but I would welcome any input it might have as to what accountability legislation looks like.  I am aware that the Sl&aacute;intecare report calls for it to be implemented, as do I, but what does it actually look like?  How would it actually work?  <\/p><p> Term F is extensive, but it can be summed up by saying that it is about the laboratories.  It addresses the entirety of the laboratory issue, from the decision to outsource to how they work now and how they will work in the future, and their accreditation.  It is important that it is there. <\/p><p> On HPV testing, it has been said to me and in public that the women of Ireland need to see not just that we have responded to a terrible situation and are trying to deal with it, but that we have gone above and beyond that by saying that women in this country were let down and making clear the steps we are taking to ensure not just that they will not be let down again, but also to make sure that the health services are improved.  HPV testing is a real way of doing this as it would provide more accurate tests and a reduced requirement for smear tests.  Ireland would be one of the first countries to move in this direction.  I do not want to make any commitments that I cannot stand by, but at the moment I am told that HPV testing will be introduced in October.  I will scrutinise that further and revert to the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#V00900","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I will refer to some items already raised but look at different aspects of those issues.

However, an alarm bell must sound somewhere if the same issue arises on more than one occasion at the same location.  How long do we wait before the alarm goes off and someone decides that the issue has to be looked at immediately?<\/p><p>On the question of the combative nature of the system in this country, why is it necessary to fall into legal combat?

These practices were appalling and went on for many years without being checked.  I cannot understand why they occurred.

It was picked up within the Saolta hospital group towards the end of 2014 after six babies had been referred.  It is very hard to know, considering international evidence, what is the tipping point.  The Deputy has made very valid points.  We were here in February and spoke about the need to implement serious incident management forums for maternity services only.  Had they been in place in the Saolta hospital group at the time, there is a very good chance that some of these issues would have been picked up earlier.  There was a comprehensive review carried out by Saolta long before Professor Walker's report was commenced.  It identified almost all of the issues, and Professor Walker's report confirms that point.  Most of those things have been implemented at this stage or are in the process of being implemented.<\/p> <p>  The core point the Deputy is making is absolutely valid.  We need specific focus on maternity services in terms of incident reviews, but the broader issue is the governance of maternity services, which involves the maternity networks.  We are absolutely committed to achieving that.  It is being progressed in the Saolta group, which is moving from what it currently has to what it is describing as clinical business units.  It is the same concept; a clinically managed network that ensures that the smaller units do not operate in isolation but rather work in collaboration with the bigger units.  One of the developments Saolta has come up with is the creation of an integrated unit between the site at University Hospital Galway and the Ballinasloe site.  On Deputy O'Connell's point about the safety of the unit, safety is one of the core elements.  Professor Walker was at pains last week to stress that developments on the Portiucula site are significantly different, and that for normal risk women - I appreciate that it is very hard to define a normal risk woman - Portiuncula is appropriate and safe.  Professor Walker appeared before the committee last week.

I know the State Claims Agency has spoken about this already, but it is a tool at its disposal.  Whether we need, as we have, a Personal Injuries Assessment Board, a medical injuries assessment board or something similar to move such cases completely out of the courts is something that warrants significant consideration as well.  We need to find a system that is less adversarial in getting to the bottom of these things.

There is a level of scrutiny that clinical teams within the maternity networks that are putting it in place will have, really drilling down into the detail and the things that will set off warning bells for them.  The further up, the more we rely on the cascading upwards of issues and learning.  That is the point I was making, not that there cannot be appropriate flags and signals.

To go back to the issue of mandatory disclosure first, I was particularly impressed by an article by Pat Leahy in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>last week, which the Minister may have seen, in which Mr. Leahy gives some deserved criticism of us all as a political class about the failure to face down establishment opposition to mandatory disclosure, whose time seems to have arrived as an idea.  One person I know who has direct experience of the problems surrounding mandatory disclosure says not disclosing information about one's institutional or personal professional failing is like driving away from the scene of an accident.  Has the Minister formally, intellectually and politically committed to mandatory disclosure?  If so, when did he mentally and publicly commit to it first?  If I am on the right track about the change in thinking, if it is a good idea now, why was it not a good idea before now?<\/p><p>Regarding the issue of abortion, the posters and what the Minister himself said, I have always opposed the public use of graphic images of abortion because it is disrespectful to the dignity of the unborn child whose death is so graphically depicted for one thing and, second, I worry about its impact on children and other vulnerable people.  However, I would like a precise answer to this question: does the Minister not think there is something of a disconnect or double standard if, on the one hand, there is outrage on one's own behalf or other people's behalf about such graphic images and, on the other, a lack of empathy towards the child whose death is depicted, however graphically?  I am just asking the question.<\/p><p>I wondered why the Minister appeared to laugh at Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's question about what debates he will do and when.  I would have thought it is part of his ministerial stewardship and his duty, if he is leading the Government's campaign to make a very significant change to our law on a life-or-death issue which will have far-reaching effects, to be out there publicly.  I know he is a busy man, but he has quite a phalanx of people, including party-political people and civil servants, behind him to help him do his job.  I would have thought it is very legitimate to ask him the precise detail of what he will debate and when.  There is a tendency across Government to use press releases, press conferences and other situations whereby Ministers and powerful political people are unchallenged.  He has been out very little on the abortion question in any circumstance in which people can respectfully challenge him.  Frankly, there are big questions, and Deputy Murphy O'Mahony is right to ask about GPs.  The Minister is proposing a far-reaching law providing for abortion up to 12 weeks gestation on demand and up to six months gestation effectively on demand because that is how it works in Britain, where abortion is available on a mental health ground.  GPs do not have scanning equipment.  People are entitled to know whether we are looking at a future in which abortion clinics will be established in this country.  Regardless of what side of the issue he is on, does the Minister not think he has a duty to be out debating this issue soon, often and in circumstances in which he can be respectfully challenged on detail?  What we are not getting is detail on what will happen if people repeal the eighth amendment and give politicians full power to legalise abortion.  I agree with his empathy for women in crisis pregnancy.  I am asking him why I neither see nor hear any empathy for the children who will be aborted if our law changes.  Very specifically, I am asking him for detail as to when he will debate this issue respectfully, one on one or in circumstances in which he can be challenged honestly, and how many times he will debate.  He is no doubt talking to his advisers about when he will debate these matters, so we are entitled to some detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#X01200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":688,"content":"<p>To be very clear, the reason I laughed was that I recalled the image last week, in the middle of a cervical cancer scandal, when we were trying to reassure women about their own health, a responsibility with which I, as Minister for Health, was charged, of a photo shoot outside Leinster House with a podium with my name on it asking where I was.

I have two brief questions and one substantive one; I will try to rush them.  The first one is on scoliosis, about which there was a good deal of publicity recently but which appears to have fallen off the agenda.  I know many families personally affected by this issue and I want the witnesses to clarify the four-month target in terms of a waiting list.  Where is that?  How are the plans going to recruit three additional surgeons - two in Crumlin and one in Temple Street hospitals - because from what I am hearing, the waiting lists are still extremely long?<\/p> <p>  The second question is on the issue of the legislation post the referendum, if it is passed, and this other issue that has arisen.  I agree that the Minister and the Department of Health should answer misinformation if it is in the public domain.  I have said that previously.  That does not involve spending money.  It involves the Department of Health answering basic questions.  We need basic biology lessons for a number of people about the abilities of foetuses and otherwise to speak and what they can do, what is proposed in the legislation and what 92% of abortions would actually look like at six months gestation, which is not what is being displayed on poles.  Approximately 0.1% of abortions that took place in Britain last year are being presented as the common, everyday abortion.  I urge the Department to intervene because these notions that are going around are very dangerous.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, on the broader issue of cervical cancer and also Portiuncula Hospital, one would not have to be too bright to notice that there is a pattern in this State of women and women's health not being taken very seriously.  We have the hepatitis C issue, the Savita Halappanavar case and many other examples.  I wonder if the HSE or the Government intend to look into the reason that is the case.  I have my own ideas about the history of misogyny in this country but, internationally, is the HSE aware of gender bias in the delivery of health care?  There have been many studies done on that, for example, a study called The Gender Pain Gap by Crook and Tunks.  They studied accident and emergency departments when women and men attended reporting roughly similar levels of pain and found that men were treated within 49 minutes and women were treated within 65 minutes.  It is not just men, although I cannot fail to notice the male line-up among the HSE witnesses.  There are two women but they have not spoken yet.  There are more women now who are general practitioners, GPs, and who are studying medicine.  That does not mean they do not also have a gender bias.  Another study on gender stereotyping in nursing care was done which showed nurses different symptoms and before they knew who they were attributed to, the nurses responded differently if they were male or female.<\/p> <p>    There is an inherent assumption, which runs through literature and culture, that women are hysterical, emotional and not rational and therefore are not as likely to be believed.  For example, one in ten women suffers from endometriosis but, in general, it takes seven or eight years for it to be diagnosed.  The symptoms are severe, chronic pain.  Why is that?  All of this has to be considered by the HSE.  In the case I highlighted earlier, the woman was telling her GP about symptoms and was being fobbed off because of the two clear smear tests.  This culture of not listening to women and not believing them is extremely unhealthy and should be examined.<\/p> <p>  In Portiuncula Hospital, the fact is that a couple had two children who died.  I was not there and I have not looked at the medical records but in the second case, when that woman showed up, she was not believed in terms of the critical nature of her previous pregnancy.  She was not taken as seriously as she should have been.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about plaques on walls.  There is a saying in the Bible, \"Onto the woman I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception\".  That seems to be carried over as gospel into the health service as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#Y03400","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I am sure the Deputy did not mean it like this but the only reason the two female members of our delegation have not spoken is because none of the questions has been directed to community services or acute hospitals.<\/p><p>Were they, they would be the people best placed and most able to answer the questions here.

We must all be aware of gender bias continually.  I point out, however, that we have the first-ever national maternity strategy.  It is a bit weird in some ways that it is the first national maternity strategy.  We never had one before but we have one now.  We have seen, notwithstanding the terrible things that have happened in relation to cervical cancer and screening, that the rate of that cancer has fallen in Ireland each year since the programme was introduced.  We have seen progress in breast cancer also.  I do not know if colleagues in the HSE want to add anything on that.  We should always challenge and be challenged to ensure that our systems are not biased.  However, I do not see any policy being pursued by the Irish health service that is biased on a gender basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050900002#Y03500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525852800,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I agree with the Minister's point.

In the development of the service plan for 2019, inequalities and the potential for those in respect of access to services or outcomes from services will be key things for us to look at.  Endometriosis is a key thing affecting far more women than is generally understood.  One of the difficulties is that it is not generally understood, including in GP-land.  Sometimes, people are slow to pick up on it and refer the lady in question for more specialist care within gynaecology.

There are 20 children who have been waiting for over a year and who were offered a number of options, but whose families chose to have the children treated in Ireland despite the delay.  The priority is to get those children treated as soon as possible.  For the remaining 121 children, our objective is to work within the four-month target.  To clarify matters for families, the four-month target period runs from the time the child is deemed to require the surgery.  Obviously, there will be some variation because children are still in growth patterns.  However, the four-month target has been set explicitly and we intend to work within it.<\/p> <p>  It is worth saying at the committee that the feedback from those children who opted for overseas options has been extraordinary and the subject of much discussion.

Being able to offer choice was significant in the circumstances.  With specific reference to Crumlin, the objective is to increase its capacity to five days.  It is important to acknowledge, however, the efforts by Cappagh and Temple Street hospitals, which are now hitting the targets.

I have not been furnished with answers and will await replies from the State Claims Agency.  However, I find it mind-boggling that the information is not to hand; not for me, but for the Minister.  Does the Minister not receive regular reports on the clinical incidence and number of misdiagnoses?  This would all feed into the issue of unqualified consultants.  Does the Minister see dangers around that and a risk of escalation?  There were 34 cases of clinical incidence and 575 cases resulted in claims against the HSE.  In most incidents where there is misdiagnosis, people will not bother taking cases.  However, my question is about reporting to the Minister himself and whether he will change anything in that regard following the situation with Vicky Phelan.<\/p> <p>  What plans does the Minister have in place to address spinal surgery waiting lists?  I know people who have been waiting several years for spinal surgery.  Can these patients go abroad?

The reason I do not is because the European situation was cited, whereas we know it can be approved conditionally and has been in most EU member states.  As such, this does not stop countries facilitating the provision of this treatment.  Why are we not doing that here?  On the price, the Minister knows the &euro;300,000 per patient quoted is a public price.  It is not a negotiated price.  That really concerns me because it is untrue.  Is it not the duty of the HSE to negotiate the price?  As to a timeline, if the drug company submits more or new information, how long will it take before approval is given?<\/p> <p>  I will ask the Minister about Versatis again.  I thank him for the answer he has given but it means there are still 23,000 patients who were on Versatis.  I take the Minister's point on overprescribing but I ask him specifically whether he is monitoring how many extra patients are using morphine patches as a result of the withdrawal of Versatis.

I was one of several Oireachtas Members who met with the general manager of the hospital and I have met with the lead cardiac consultants.  They tell us that increasing the hours at the existing lab will not make much difference, it is throwing good money after bad and is not really what is required.  What is required is a modular lab.

We last met two months ago and proposals are still being examined.  Why does it take so long for that to be examined?  Can the Minister commit to deploying a modular lab and if he cannot, why not?  Whatever about the national review being a matter of policy underpinned by clinical and medical evidence, which will take considerable time, it would not be a fundamental policy shift to deploy a modular lab because there is a mobile lab there at the moment.  That has reduced waiting times for diagnostic angiograms but the effect is that the wait time for interventions has risen considerably because 30% of those diagnosed will need an intervention.  We are solving one problem but creating another problem.  It makes sense to put in a modular lab that can perform interventions and diagnostic angiograms.  There is no good reason that cannot be done.  I do not understand why it has taken so long to get to the point where we cannot get a commitment from the Minister. <\/p> <p>  I asked specifically about public consultation in the national review.  It states that public consultation will start in June, and will last two months.  What exactly does that mean?

When will the public be told when and where they can make their views known? <\/p> <p>  The national review is scheduled to take 18 months.

On behalf of the finance SPC, I welcome this opportunity to present to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I thank the Chairperson, members and secretariat for facilitating this presentation.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the LPT is a topical one and the finance SPC commissioned a study by Dr. Pat McCloughan, who joins us today, on the topic.  This study covers much of the same ground as that covered in the report of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight on LPT revaluation published in March.  However, there is significant additionality in the report commissioned by the finance SPC.<\/p> <p>  Our SPC took the terms of reference set by Minister for Finance and left aside arguments regarding the actual tax or possible alternatives to it.  Our key focus was on the legitimacy of the tax as perceived by the electorate in the context of local elections and on the changes we see as desirable.  In 2013, people were promised additional services that have not been forthcoming.  Dublin City Council's net benefit from LPT is &euro;4 million.  To put that in context, Dublin City Council's total budget is &euro;900 million, while &euro;80 million is collected per annum through the LPT in its area.  In effect, just 5% of the money paid by Dublin City Council households has been made available to fund new services.  A key concern is that LPT receipts have been substituted for previously used tax revenues but that practice is only applied in the Dublin city area and other major cities.  The true level of equalisation applied via the LPT is distorted and is far removed from what the electorate understands it to be.<\/p> <p>  Dublin City Council applies the maximum 15% discount every year.  This flows directly from the electoral mandate of councillors in 2014 and reflects the opinion of the electorate.  The CEO and some political parties, most notably the Green Party and the Labour Party, have sought to reduce the 15% discount on the basis of generating additional funds for services.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the legitimacy of the tax, two factors must be considered.<\/p><p>The two main factors affecting legitimacy of tax is the lack of local resourcing - that is the local spend from the tax - and the fact that 20% of the money collected flows by way of equalisation to other counties in what is seen to be an arbitrary and obscure fashion.  Dublin City Council collected an additional &euro;2 million last year but our income went down by &euro;160,000, which was slightly difficult.  This may give the committee an idea of the arbitrary nature of the distribution.<\/p><p> There is also a concern among the electorate that the local property tax, LPT, could become a tax on certain residential postal districts and that this tendency will increase in future.  If people have a long enough memory it brings them back to the residential property tax of the 1990s.  There is also disquiet around the lack of direct correlation between movements in property valuation and income, although the tax implies there is a correlation.  The LPT framework, as structured, embeds the inequity between the living costs of similarly paid workers in the capital city Dublin, for example, as against rural Ireland.  This perception could cause our capital to be avoided as a place to live.<\/p><p> One of the key points is the need for the removal of equalisation.  In the past poorer local authorities were subsidised when we were in financial straitened circumstances, but now the removal of equalisation would be a positive step forward in making the tax easier to understand and in achieving tax efficiency.  National government should fund this aspect of local government funding.<\/p><p> Dublin City Council contains some of the more affluent areas of the State and also some of the most socially disadvantaged areas.  This is visible in areas of Dublin city centre where there are some 100 flat complexes alongside areas of affluence.<\/p><p> The progressive nature of the tax is dealt with in our report as is the high rate of compliance.  The high rate of compliance leads the committee to believe that the tax will remain in place for the future.  Removing the current exemptions, particularly for new builds, will increase the level of resources available for local government.  We calculate that this measure has cost Dublin City Council more than &euro;10 million to date.<\/p><p> Resources are still very scarce as can be seen by the condition of footpaths and road surfaces in the capital city.  These spending areas were reduced by more than 80% during the financial crisis and they have yet to recover to levels needed for sustainable renewal programmes.<\/p><p> The area of deferral arrangements also needs to be looked at.  The deferral arrangements were included in the context of a short life for the tax, foreseen as a period of three years.  This does not really correlate to where we are now and there is a need for a general review.  There are issues of people on low income living in valuable properties.  Low income can be associated with ageing and also with disabilities, situations that do not distinguish between people living in small or large houses.<\/p><p> We agree with the recommendation that a revaluation takes place and that a valuation factor would be adjusted.  This means that if the property prices have doubled, the current evaluation factor of .18 would need to be halved to .09.  We have seen property price increases of more than 100%; they have nearly doubled since the low point of 2012.   The tax should be fair to the greatest degree possible and the consultation process - which we are part of today - should be transparent.<\/p><p> Our committee operates on a cross-party basis politically and the report reflects the views of the members.  I shall conclude with some figures to put Dublin City Council's LPT funding in context: Dublin City Council is 12% of the number of houses covered by LPT; it provides 16.5% of the money raised through LPT; and 42% of the money raised by Dublin City Council in LPT comes from properties that are worth more than &euro;300,000.  We would see the value of exemptions forgone as a very significant figure.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and I am happy to take any questions that committee members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018050900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ruair&iacute; McGinley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525854600,"counter":777,"content":"<p>I thank the councillor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018050900002#D00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1525854600,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I thank Councillor McGinley for the very detailed presentation and documentation supplied.  I shall make a comment rather than put a question.  There are occasions when something is so badly designed and so unfit for purpose that trying to tinker around the edges will not solve the fundamental problem.  I am as convinced today as I was when this tax was first introduced that the LPT is not fit for purpose and it needs to be scrapped.  We need to go back to the drawing board for a more appropriate way of funding local government services.<\/p> <p>  There is much misperception in the public and media debates about the local property tax.  It is important to restate the reasons why some of us are very opposed to it in principle.  The idea of a charge that pays no attention to ability to pay is wrong.  The councillors have already cited the people who are asset rich and income poor, especially older people or pensioners with larger properties in more affluent parts of the city, who might be on very small occupational pensions.  Any reform of local government taxation that does not take into account the ability to pay will not work.<\/p> <p>  While there are fewer people now in negative equity than when this tax was introduced, the tax is on debt as well as on an asset.  I am not aware of anywhere else in the world where a property tax taxes debt.  Any reform of any reasonable property tax would have to take that into account in a way that this LPT does not.<\/p> <p>  There are small features of the tax that some people do not realise.  Households whose incomes are too low to pay the charge may defer the tax, but they are charged an additional 4% annually.  This is bizarre.  I am sure that all members are aware of cases, usually of older people or people who are just above the income thresholds, that simply cannot pay the tax.  Their deferred payment is mounting up and accumulating the 4% debt annually.<\/p> <p>  I have huge sympathy for the councillors.  I sat on South Dublin County Council when we had to deal with this and we lost euro for euro.  For every euro in local property tax that was generated the council lost a euro in central government funding.  At a time when people were paying more for their local services, and therefore expecting more from the council and the councillors, they were getting exactly the same services or less, depending on how the fund worked out.  That has created huge resentment and anger among the local public directed towards councillors and council officials and staff, when it is not actually the responsibility or the fault of those people.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally, the LPT was not introduced as a tax to try to fund or improve the financing of local government.  This was not the purpose of the LPT.  This tax was introduced at the time to assist the Government in closing its fiscal deficit.  For all of those reasons it would be my preference to draw a line in the sand to say the tax does not work.  We need an honest conversation about funding local government.  If we continue to be solely reliant on or simply revert to 100% central government funding and grants for housing and roads supplemented by business rates, this is not a good model either.  I am a little worried, not by the councillors' presentations, but by the Government just having a review of the local property tax.  It is stopping us from having the bigger discussion around the longer term funding.  I lived in Belfast for 11 years, and while I am not saying its rates system is perfect at least people there can see a broad range or basket of regional and local services that they get for the tax that they pay.  This aspect needs to be reformed.<\/p> <p>  I have huge sympathy with the council.  We need to return to this issue in our programme at a later stage.  I am, however as convinced as I was before that the LPT is not reformable, it needs to be scrapped and we need to start over again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018050900002#D00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1525854600,"counter":779,"content":"<p>There are no real questions there Deputy.

I acknowledge his work on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I have never made a secret of the fact that I am in favour of a local council tax.  We need to be clear and we need to be honest.  Local services must be paid for and somebody has to pay for them.  I am of the view that everybody must pay some percentage.  We are aware that social housing tenants pay no local property tax at any rate.  I do not believe that this is correct or fair.  I do not suggest that they should pay the same, but it should be related to a person's income and situation.  If we are to reform the local property tax we need to call it what it is; it is a council tax.<\/p><p>To be an effective and fair council tax, 100% of it should be retained by the local authorities.  It should be no less than that.  According to the figures in the report to which Councillor McGinley referred, people were promised additional services.  That is true, but we have not seen them.  He mentioned that Dublin City Council's net benefit from the local property tax was &euro;4 million in the context of a &euro;900 million budget and the collection of &euro;80 million in LPT per annum.  In effect, just 5% of the moneys paid by Dublin householders has been made available to fund new services in Dublin.  That tells its own story.<br\/><br\/>I go back to the tax.  It is important to carry out a review.  We have heard suggestions in the media in the last week that the Government is considering reviewing this.  Politicians are in the business of politics and they are conscious of local elections next year.  There is a great deal of resistance to paying any tax.  No one likes paying taxes.  While there is a high rate of compliance with the tax because Revenue collects it, that compliance would not be there if the local authority were collecting it.  Where Revenue comes on heavily and people receive a brown envelope with a harp on it referring to money owed, people comply.  That is the reality of it.<br\/><br\/>Where are we going from here?  There are three things.  I refer to recommendations Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, of the Thornhill review, in particular recommendation No. 9.  Recommendation No. 9 states that, over the medium term, the Government should consider moving to a system whereby local authorities retain 100% of the LPT revenue raised in their areas.  That is very important.  I congratulate PMCA Economic Consulting for its submission, which was a very comprehensive one.  It refers to a gradual transition from a local property tax to a council local tax, or CLT.  That is the model.  If we are going to have proper reform of local government, greater powers must be devolved to city and county councillors.  They need to determine how this money is spent and they must be accountable to the people for it.  I cited to some people before I came to the meeting that in the borough of Greenwich in the greater London area residents receive a pie chart setting out how their council taxes are paid.  Steps are taken in the case of a shortfall.  For example, library services were closed for four Saturdays last December because they were over-budget.  That is communicated to the electorate.  It was stated that the library service was shut for four Saturdays to bring it back into line with its budget.  That is responsible budgeting and responsible local government.<br\/><br\/>I welcome this as the beginning of a debate.  I am not sure we will see any reform in the next 12 months given the political sensitivities around local government elections and the numbers game in Leinster House.  However, we need to have a public conversation and consultation.  We need public engagement.  It is right and proper to have a local council tax and we should not apologise for that.  People have to be given assurances, however, and they must see services provided.  I had a look only today at the literature that was originally put through my door saying there would be new swimming pools, new libraries, new beaches and new community centres, etc., as a result of this tax.  There was a huge PR exercise around this tax, but none of that has happened and people are disappointed.  Everyone must pay <i>pro rata<\/i>or on the basis of their incomes.  They should pay something, including those who live in local authority or housing association houses.  We need greater accountability from local authorities and they must be able to make real decisions.  Where local authorities are permitted to reduce their tax by 15%, they will do it.  If they could reduce it by 50%, they would do that too.  As such, we have to make the connection between this tax and local government services.  Elected members must be able to hold their local authority executive to account for the spending of this money and engage publicly and regularly with communities as to where it is going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018050900002#D00600","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525854600,"counter":783,"content":"<p>The report outlines the points the Senator makes.  It is a fact that there is a very high rate of compliance with the council tax.  The Senator may have seen in the report that the IMF commented recently that the fiscal situation in this country is quite centralised and that local authorities had a very low share of fiscal activity.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that the tax was introduced at a time of fiscal emergency.  During that time, a greater onus was placed on local authorities to work on economic development, to encourage foreign direct investment and to help Irish-owned companies.  Their fiscal contribution has not increased as a result, however.  I take the Senator's well-made point, which reflects what we say in the report.  It is worth remarking that Dublin is special in that it is the capital city and its residents have a legitimate expectation.  It is also the case that tens of thousands of commuters come into the capital every day and footpaths and local services have to work for them too.  Dublin is also the largest tourism centre in the country and, by a long shot, the largest centre of employment.  The jobs-population ratio is over 50%.  Dublin does a great deal of the heavy lifting economically.  That applies across the local authority sector and the Senator's points in that regard were well made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018050900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat McCloughan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525854600,"counter":784,"content":"<p>I emphasise the point about the 5%.

Members may have seen in the report that 20% was taken off.  There was a reduction as applied by the members.  As to the balance, what happens with Dublin City Council is that it is assumed we can self-fund.  Grants previously brought in from the Exchequer are substituted with the local property tax.  That issue only affects Dublin city.  I draw members' attention to that.  Equalisation is one piece, but that is another.  I take Dr. McCloughan's point.  The report discusses the disparity in communities within Dublin city where one has very rich and affluent communities and others which are not.  That type of funding is very important to provide for community-building processes and measures regarding the social fabric to reduce the disparity over time.  That flow just has not occurred but it is very important to the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018050900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathy Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1525854600,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank Councillor McGinley for his presentation this morning.  I go back a bit in time to my attendance at the launch of the \"Putting People First\" document at Dublin Castle.  I was intrigued by it because I thought power was being given back to local authorities.  I thought councillors were being given the power to make the decisions and to spend the money.  I have to give Phil Hogan credit for selling this tax very well.  He sold it as a new income stream for local authorities but did not quite tell the public that it was replacing the local government fund.  That was the first annoying thing.<\/p> <p>  When one goes through the process, one realises that one loses 20% for the equalisation fund.  The one thing that was probably not mentioned in the discussion here so far is the hugely disappointing fact that the baseline figure has not been renewed in most local authorities for over 20 years.  While we can agree or disagree on the 20% equalisation fund, in the third year of it in my county, the stronger areas were trying to keep their property tax.  Whether we like it or not, there is a benefit in the equalisation fund where the strong can help to support the weak.  If we had done that in Wicklow, Greystones would have had a song and a dance every night of the week while other parts of the county suffered.  We can justify the equalisation fund from that point of view.  My argument is about the baseline.  Counties in which the population has grown to a huge extent have not seen an acknowledgement and accounting for that.  Additional services are required to keep pace with that growth in population.  The argument for local authorities should be on the baseline figure.  We need to put up a very strong argument for a comprehensive review, which is where we can get the money back in to allow local democracy to work in relation to spending decisions.<\/p><p>In County Wicklow 50% of our money is gone through equalisation and because of the baseline.  The figure is probably even higher in Dublin City Council.  The discretionary fund is just a joke that we are leaving for councillors.  I notice that in a number of contributions it was said we should move towards having a council tax.  Perhaps that is the way we should go.  If we move back to property valuations, it was a blunt tax based purely on property values.  In my area I know low income families who are located in a very scenic part of County Wicklow.  Their properties have a huge value but their incomes are low.  Their ability to pay has to be taken into account.  Equally, I am concerned that when we look at the way the commercial rates system works, one can go 20 to 30 years without a revaluation and then be hit with a huge increase.  We are beginning to go down the same road, unless there is some revaluation now, rather than kicking the can down the road.  We cannot just go for a property-based revaluation, as otherwise people will be hit with increases of 100% or 200% in their property tax, with no services coming with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018050900002#E00400","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525854600,"counter":787,"content":"<p>I am reminded by what Deputy Pat Casey said that I have been around for long enough to remember the abolition of domestic rates in 1977, which is part of the reason for some of the problems we face today.  Going back to the genesis of the local property tax after the crash in 2008 and looking at its contribution to the total tax take, it only accounts for 1% of tax revenue.  It is a minimalist tax.  I have looked at property taxes in other jurisdictions.  There is no doubt that, in effect, it only replaces the local government fund.  It is very hard to explain to constituents - certainly those who expect local services to be improved, which has not been the case - that, of the amount taken in, what is left over is &euro;4 million.  <\/p> <p>  On the relative price stability required, I think Dr. Pat McCloughan will agree with me that if we do not do something about the tax base, people will be paying double what they were paying in 2013.  In one way, it is fortunate that it was introduced in 2013 because, in effect, it was the lowest valuation this century.  It is galling for councillors to see the equalisation fund going to what would be regarded as relatively wealthy counties, including Tipperary, Mayo and Donegal.  That is a major issue for councillors and is a reason we have opted to reduce the tax by 15% every year.  Essentially, we are asking what is the point and saying we might as well give our constituents the benefits of it.<\/p> <p>  Another point I want to make which I brought up with Ms Kathy Quinn concerns the loss of revenue to Dublin City Council in respect of new builds since 2013 which has been quite considerable.  We worked out figures because it does not apply to any apartment built since 2013.  On a cumulative basis, if this were to continue until 2019, the loss for Dublin City Council would be &euro;15 million.  We also worked out figures for the other three local authorities, which would also add up to approximately &euro;15 million.  Therefore, for the four Dublin local authorities, we are talking about a loss of &euro;30 million as a result of not dealing with this issue.  It is vital that it be dealt with.  In my electoral area apartments are being built in Ballsbridge, including penthouses that cost &euro;6.5 million.  We have worked out that the figure would be between &euro;16,000 and &euro;18,000 a year if full local property tax was to be paid, but no local property tax will be paid on these very extravagant and expensive properties.  That issue has to be addressed immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018050900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paddy McCartan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525854600,"counter":788,"content":"<p>We are talking about where the local property tax fund goes.  Senator Victor Boyhan and I worked on many budgets together.  The discretionary figure in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is approximately &euro;2.5 million and one is then talking about reducing commercial rates.  When one receives the final figures, it is too late in the process and there are all of these complications.  There are many very experienced councillors, including the delegates.  While I know my area and a few others well, we cannot lose sight of the fact that approximately &euro;21 million of the money goes into housing grants.  There is transparency on where the local property tax fund goes in certain areas.  We have some fantastic parks and public amenities in D&uacute;n Laoghaire which I do not think anybody can doubt.  While I know that Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin did not mean it, remarks about scrapping the local property tax are not helpful.  It is a little like scrapping the water tax.  Look at where we are now.  One still has to pay for a service, it is a matter of how one pays for it.  On the local property tax, Deputy Pat Casey is dead right; it is about the baseline which needs to be looked at again.  We talk about projects that have been finished since 2013.  They have to pay their way.  We have to re-evaluate the process.<\/p> <p>  Whether we call it a local property tax, a council tax or whatever else, in general, people do not mind paying for a service when they see it.  We have a job to do to remind them of where the money goes.  As the economy is recovering, there is a ripe opportunity to restructure the local property tax, but I do not believe there is an appetite in any party, although I can only speak for my own, to increase it or the burden on any family.  As was said, there are many asset-rich homes, on which very little income is coming in.  We need to be very cognisant of this when we look at any re-evaluation of the system.  Senator Victor Boyhan is dead right that the principle of paying for services and seeing what one is paying for is a good one.  If we scrap anything, with what will we replace it?  One has to pay for services in some shape or form.  At least, there is transparency when it comes to the local property tax.  People can log on to any local authority website and see exactly where the local property tax fund goes.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with it, there is a transparent process.<\/p> <p>  There is a figure of &euro;21 million in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I want it to be focused on the provision of capital funding for affordable housing, for which we are pressing, and the rent to buy scheme, for which we are also pressing and which I hope other local authorities will look, to give first-time buyers living in rental accommodation an opportunity to purchase and offset what they have paid in rent against the cost of purchasing that affordable home from the local authority.  That is what I want to see the local property tax fund really targeting - those who need it the most, as well as people who use services.  <\/p> <p>  I do not really have questions as such.

A big value is placed on these posts.  The Chairman asked why would anybody want to be elected to a local authority?  It is because we can exercise a limited level power, which comes through money.<\/p><p>In terms of the baseline funding review, it is to consider the financing arrangements for local government more generally.  The financial landscape has changed from being an emergency.  I take issue, slightly, with what has been said by Councillor McCartan.  I acknowledge that Donegal is a poor county so I am not surprised that it needs some money but the national government should decide.  The idea that one takes an existing situation, and Sligo County Council might be the nearest thing we have to a bankrupt local authority, but we need the national government to decide rather than tinkering at the edges.  We have known about this matter for a long time as there have been cases for the past 20 years.  This is not a newsflash and I have been around long enough to know about some of those things.<\/p><p>There are eight recommendations in our report and they have been fairly and practically drawn up.  Whether it is through this committee or through the officials and various working groups, this work is relatively urgent.  People are very conscious of the tax.  There are development opportunities for local government into the future.  Councillor McCartan was correct to draw our attention to 1978 and to a legitimate tax.  My parents paid domestic rates which they did not like but they understood what services would be provided.  Our bins were collected and there was a direct correlation between paying and getting a service.  We need to return to that situation.  Again, Councillor McCartan touched on the matter, the local authority sector must stand up for itself even though it is the smallest in Europe.  Outside of Russia, this country has the most centralised form of local democracy.  I can safely say that it is more centralised in Ireland than in Russia because Russians think they would not get away with it.  The people in the Custom House are really the permanent government, and there is a permanent government.  Their view is they are trying to administer local government in Dublin city from their base in Custom House and that is an unhealthy democratic base going forward.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1525854600,"counter":791,"content":"<p>First, I ask Councillor McGinley to convey our thanks to the council and its finance committee.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions for Dr. McCloughan about the PMCA economic consultant report.

There are representatives all over the country, there are members for Tipperary and all of these places but Dublin has to stand up for itself and we believe that a national system is fair.  We need the Minister and senior Government officials to take this aspect onboard.  We, as a local authority, do not have the capacity but we are happy to make ourselves available.

Members will be glad to hear that when I went to houses and knocked on doors I heard more about the housing crisis than about the local property tax.  In other words, the tax is not the first item that people are concerned about but it is one of their top five concerns.  Two major concerns are housing and homelessness.

I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to do so.<\/p> <p>  This is a short, technical but essential Bill which aims to ensure that IDA Ireland continues to have the capacity to provide property solutions to potential investors.  I am sure that members will recognise that in order to sustain and to grow foreign direct investment in regional areas in particular, there must be sufficient property solutions for new and existing clients.  In fact this is a key factor in encouraging multinational companies to locate here.  Accordingly, a vital aspect of IDA Ireland's work remains as has been the case for many years connecting those firms with property solutions and to be able to do so effectively, it needs the continued capacity to purchase property that can be marketed to potential investors.<\/p><p> This Bill addresses the implications of the 2015 Supreme Court judgment and seeks to ensure that IDA Ireland will continue to have the capacity to compulsory acquire property on an exceptional basis in very limited circumstances, subject to strict requirements.  As per the terms of that judgment, provision has been made in the Bill for an independent body, which is An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to undertake a full adjudicatory role in the process, a role that has been very much aligned to its existing role in compulsory purchases carried out by other State bodies.  The Bill does not grant any additional or expanded compulsory purchase powers to IDA Ireland, rather the Bill seeks to modernise the process and apply best practice to it.  Second, the Bill will ensure that IDA Ireland can continue to purchase property by agreement, even when it is for the future use and no specific company has been identified as the beneficiary of the acquisition.<\/p><p> The committee will, of course, be aware that regional development is one of the key priorities of this Government, my Department and of IDA Ireland.  It is a common goal that all of us share.  We are committed to doing everything we can to both sustain and create employment opportunities all over Ireland and IDA Ireland has a significant role to play in that work.  Given the critical role, particularly in terms of trying to support regional development, it is essential that there is no legal uncertainty when it comes to its property purchasing powers.

I acknowledge that amendments Nos. 1 and 2 in my name were ruled out of order.  With the indulgence of the Chairman, I wish to make a number of points which apply to all the sections.  I will not repeat my arguments on the sections or detain members, the Minister and his officials unnecessarily.  The points I make now apply to this and all the other sections I oppose.<\/p><p>My goal in tabling amendments to the Bill was with a view to reining in the powers granted to IDA Ireland under the Industrial Development Act 1986 to compulsorily acquire land for use by industry.  Unfortunately, the amendment which gave effect to that was ruled out of order, so I will summarise why I am opposing the section that copperfastens this power of IDA Ireland.<\/p><p>Its power to take land from people and to give it to private companies is quite extraordinary.  It is extraordinary in the sense that it is incredibly far-reaching and it is extraordinary in the sense that on a global scale it is incredibly unusual.  I made the point on Second Stage that if one goes through the literature on CPOs globally, what is very striking is that it is never mentioned in the context of state expropriation of land on behalf of private multinational corporations, which is exactly the activity that gave us this Bill in the first place.  What is talked about is the state compulsorily acquiring for state infrastructural projects, which is fair enough obviously, and occasionally we hear about it in the context of public private partnerships, PPP, unsurprisingly in a neoliberal world, but the idea of actually forcibly expropriating land for private multinationals is incredibly rare on a global scale.  That is what this Bill does by giving land to them, including to American corporations which could well afford to buy land from people if they were willing to surrender it voluntarily.  <\/p><p>It is not about compulsory purchase orders, CPOs for schools, hospitals, roads or anything like this.  This Bill deals only with CPOs for large industry, which in Ireland means foreign industry.  In point of fact, Enterprise Ireland has been specifically excluded from the Bill.  We are not talking about small or even medium-sized business.  A review of compulsory purchase order laws by a World Bank senior counsel said that an overarching principle in most cases is that a government's taking powers are extraordinary powers that are intended to meet public needs that are not well addressed through the operation of the market, hence it is not typical for laws to allow governments to use compulsory acquisition as the normal means of assembling land for purposes that are clearly commercial, industrial or other profitably private uses alone.  That is exactly what we are talking about here.  IDA Ireland has had this power since the 1980s but the only time it tried to exercise it was in the Thomas Reid case<b>.<\/b>The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which said that not only had IDA Ireland operated<i>ultra vires <\/i>of the 1986 legislation, but it was also objectively biased in its quest to CPO Thomas Reid's home.<\/p><p>The objective bias in that case derived from the fact that the then chairman of IDA Ireland, Mr. O'Mahony, at the time of the CPO on Thomas Reid's land was also a non-executive director of the PM group, a consultancy firm that shows his site as the most attractive one for Intel from a survey conducted in west Dublin.  The Supreme Court found that Mr. O'Mahony participated in two key decisions relating to the lands at Blakestown - the original decision to initiate the compulsory purchase and the crucial final decision in the making of the CPO in November 2012.  Mr. Justice McKechnie found that a reasonable observer might doubt whether the chairman of IDA Ireland would be in a position to remain as objective as he might have been expected to be in the circumstances.  I think that the finding of objective bias on IDA Ireland's part in the Reid case is something we should bear in mind when we are deliberating on consider giving it more powers in this regard.  A State agency, which is not democratically accountable to anybody, having the power to expropriate land on behalf of private industry is crazy enough, but this Bill copperfastens that, when we know that the one time IDA Ireland exercised this power, it did not do so in an upfront manner.  This raises very serious questions.<\/p><p>We have zero guarantees that the same thing will not happen again, and the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Bill is insufficient to police it.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la's remit is not to investigate shady dealings or potential bias.  Apart from any concerns regarding potential abuses, I remind members that if a private company wants to acquire land, it can always approach the landowner with an offer.  If that first offer is not good enough, it can always raise the offer or decide it is not worth that figure.  Why can the company not do that?  Why does the company absolutely have to have that piece of land?  Bringing in IDA Ireland to take land from a landowner because the company is not willing to pay a high enough price or because the landowner does not want to sell, as was the position in the Thomas Reid case.  I am sure that 99% of people in Ireland would not agree with that and they would be appalled that IDA Ireland would be given that power.  <\/p><p>My amendments to this Bill which would have had the effect of forcing private companies to have to ask landowners to sell their land and pay the asking price were ruled out of order.  It means that it will continue to be the case that private companies can do as they have done and again it is a power that was exercised only once.  I think it could be abused and I am opposed to this and to the other sections, although I will not repeat the same points on the other sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018050900002#B00500","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1525880400,"counter":811,"content":"<p>Deputy Daly has outlined that IDA Ireland has these powers already.

Innovation is central to Ireland's competitiveness and to the ability of companies based in Ireland to compete internationally.  The job of Enterprise Ireland, as part of the wider enterprise supporting role, is to help maintain and drive innovation in Irish industry.  It achieves this by developing in-company research and development facilities and by leveraging external assets, such as the higher education system.<\/p> <p>  My Department, together with Enterprise Ireland, has considered a number of measures aimed at driving an increase in research and development.  These measures include a number of proposed amendments to Enterprise Ireland's governing legislation, four in total, to increase its ability to support research and development in a number of critical sectors.  It is my intention to introduce these four research and development-related amendments on Report Stage. <\/p> <p>  If I may, I will give a brief outline of their objectives.  One is to permit Enterprise Ireland to support research and development in the horticulture sector for the first time.  Second, it will facilitate grants to support research activity overseas, where research needs cannot be met in Ireland.  That is important as well.  Third, it will increase the flexibility of Enterprise Ireland to award grants, within permissible EU research and development grant rates, and a fourth amendment will allow the agency to make advance partial payments of research and development grants to firms that may be experiencing cashflow restrictions during research, development and innovation, RDI, projects.  <\/p> <p>  The proposed changes are deemed necessary in light of Government policy to drive an increase in RDI and related activity across our indigenous enterprise base, as well as the challenges of business posed by the Brexit decision.  In addition it is important that Enterprise Ireland can flexibly deploy the widest degree of interventions to assist indigenous industry that match supports available for other countries, particularly now in the context of Brexit.  <\/p> <p>  In addition to those four research and development-related amendments, I also intend to put forward amendments to give Enterprise Ireland powers to use certain additional lending investment instruments in certain circumstances.  This is medium to long-term debt being proposed to help scale client companies in the form of convertible loan notes and non-convertible debt instruments.  The amendments will also propose to permit certain types of follow-on investments without having to fully meet the enterprise development criteria, set out in current legislation.  These additional powers will increase the flexibility to support enterprise development and to manage those investments on a par with private sector investors.  My officials are currently working on these amendments with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and I hope to be in a position to bring them forward at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2018050900002#C01200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1525880400,"counter":823,"content":"<p>The Minister had tabled amendments to section 8 but they are not on the Committee Stage list .

There are still substantial questions to be answered in that regard as to how Wicklow County Council could seek to purchase land with a compulsory purchase order and pay more than &euro;3 million and yet nine years later, the land is not in the name of the council.  How could land be in the names of developers, Quinn and Mulryan, when there was no notice of disposal before the members of Wicklow County Council, which is a statutory body?  It is in the context of questions on the lack of scrutiny with the compulsory purchase orders powers that I have a considerable concern about this legislation.

I might begin by briefly referring to the relevant statutory functions of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in the context of today's discussion.  The commission is Ireland&rsquo;s national human rights and equality body.  We were established in November 2014 and enjoy full institutional independence.  That means we are independent officers of the State and we account directly to the Oireachtas.  Our founding legislation gives us a range of powers on a spectrum running from promotion and education activities, to significant powers to take proceedings, and to act as <i>amicus curiae<\/i>, or as adviser to the courts in superior courts in Ireland, and to initiate inquiries.  I am sure members are aware that with NHV case, the Supreme Court judgment which has given rise to the issues under discussion today, the commission was <i>amicus<\/i>and intervened in the case.<br\/><br\/>A further statutory power of the commission is to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State and to make recommendations on measures to strengthen, protect and uphold human rights and equality in the State.  It is in this context that the commission has prepared a policy position on access to the labour market for applicants for international protection, or asylum seekers, which has been circulated to members, as well as to the Minister for Justice and Equality, in advance of today&rsquo;s discussion.<br\/><br\/>The question of the right to work for asylum seekers has been a priority issue for the commission since its inception.  One of the commission&rsquo;s first acts as the newly constituted Human Rights and Equality Commission was its December 2014 Policy Statement on the System of Direct Provision, which highlighted the severe impact that lack of access to employment has on asylum seekers and their families and recommended that asylum seekers be permitted to work through opting into the recast directive.  This is an issue that has been consistently pursued by the commission over the past number of years through our legal and policy work, including our direct engagement across eight centres of direct provision in Athlone, Galway, Kerry, Cork, Limerick and Dublin.<br\/><br\/>The document I have circulated outlines some of the more complex arguments in the <i>amicus<\/i>case.  As members will be aware, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s judgment in the NHV case struck down as unconstitutional the absolute prohibition on access to the labour market for asylum seekers.  Since the Supreme Court&rsquo;s declaration in February, and in advance of opt-in to the reception conditions directive, interim measures are in place that permit asylum seekers to apply for work permits under the current law and to engage in self-employment.  The combination of salary restrictions and ineligible sectors of employment applicable under these measures pose a very significant barrier to entry level employment, and in the view of the commission are insufficient in their scope to provide effective access to employment.  The commission is also extremely concerned that in the absence of a means of accessing entry level or minimum wage employment, the self-employment scheme may serve to perpetuate vulnerability to labour exploitation and to discrimination in the workplace.  This would be contrary to Ireland&rsquo;s legal obligations to effectively protect against potential violations of equality and human rights standards.<br\/><br\/>Opting in to the directive presents an important opportunity for the State to put in place a sustainable solution to the long-running human rights and equality issue of access to employment for asylum seekers, bearing in mind that many of those seeking protection in Ireland may remain permanently in Ireland.  Ensuring a right to work while seeking asylum is also critical to overcoming both direct and indirect discrimination and barriers to integration, in ensuring equality in access to employment and effective enjoyment of the human right to work and equal enjoyment of rights in the workplace.  We have an obligation to put in place a framework for access to employment for asylum seekers that realises the constitutional protection of dignity of all persons, which is compatible with our international and European human rights obligations, and with our obligations under the Geneva Convention.  Helpfully, the recast directive itself presents that opportunity.  While the directive gives member states the power to set the conditions for access to the labour market, including the requirement to give priority to EU and European Economic Area citizens, they must do so in a way that ensures that asylum seekers have &quot;effective access&quot; to the labour market.  It is the view of the commission that effective access can be achieved from the outset if a number of key principles are observed.<br\/><br\/>First, restrictions on the sectors in which asylum seekers may work should be limited to the greatest possible degree, and access to employment should not be contingent on wage, salary or working time restrictions that are not generally applicable to other jobseekers.  Second, any limitations that may apply should be devised with the principle of &quot;effective access&quot; as the primary consideration.  In the interests of transparently assessing that threshold, any limitations which may apply should be based on publicly articulated and available policy criteria, which are subject to regular review.  Third, discrimination has a significant effect on blocking effective access to the labour market.  Effective safeguards against discrimination are therefore an essential component in the design of the provisions.  A targeted information campaign for all asylum seekers on the right to work and supports available in accessing employment and while in employment will be essential.<\/p><p>Finally, it is an established principle of equality and human rights law that, for particularly vulnerable groups, targeted policy measures may be required to make what is a right on paper a right in reality.  <\/p><p>  The Commission, in its legal work, has been made aware of significant administrative barriers faced by asylum seekers in accessing a range of services.  This includes difficulties in getting medical cards and opening bank accounts, as well as exclusion from driving licence application processes.  In order to ensure effective access to employment, the commission is of the view that the scheme for access to employment must incorporate necessary processes to ensure such administrative barriers are overcome, including through the training of officials, provision of accessible information, and the tailoring of identification requirements to the particular situation of asylum seekers.<\/p><p> Regarding the period of time a person who had applied for asylum in Ireland would wait before being able to work, I note that the recast directive requires member states to grant access to the labour market no more than nine months from the date that application was lodged.  Having considered the expert opinion of the United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees, and indeed the standards set out by the European Union elsewhere, it would be our view that Ireland should adopt what is emerging as international best practice in this area and provide for access to the labour market to be granted no later than six months after an application for asylum.<\/p><p> The policy choices that Ireland makes in how it opts into this directive are critical, and should be given careful consideration by the Oireachtas.  These policy matters extend well beyond the question of access to employment, which we are focusing on here today.  Not least, opting in to the directive will provide that the provision of material reception conditions for applicants, otherwise known as direct provision, currently provided for under the executive administrative scheme on a statutory basis, is underpinned by EU law for the first time, which is a significant development.<\/p><p> These policy choices could, and should, usefully be considered by this committee in advance of the statutory instrument on opt-in being signed by the Minister.  It is in this spirit that we have offered our views today on how effective access to employment for applicants for international protection could be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018050900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emily Logan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for her presentation.

This distorts the public's understanding of what is going on and what has been described by the Department of Justice and Equality as the \"pull factor\".  We have examined the international research in this regard, the most recent of which has been done in the University of Warwick and was published in March 2016.  The researchers examined the period 1997 to 2016.  They considered 11 pieces of research and 18 pieces of quantitative research that account for the data on why people go to a country of destination.  It is important that people understand it is not correct that employment will create a pull factor.  The research found no direct long-term correlation between access to the labour market and people's decision to go to a country.  It is much more complex than that.  They come for family and linguistic reasons.  The third reason is whether the destination country has respect for human rights and the rule of law.  There may be colonial connections.  There are very complex reasons for people coming.

There is an issue with unscrupulous employers forcing people to register as self-employed even though they are being given specific tasks and essentially being paid directly by the employer.  It is something we come across frequently for the purpose of tax and other reasons and in the case of asylum seekers it is very likely to avoid a number of legal obligations.  It is a very real risk particularly when the threshold is being set so high to try to get a work permit.  It is a threshold many people who are Irish citizens would probably struggle to reach - to find &euro;1,000 and ensure there is a job offer with &euro;30,000 in pay.  It is a very high threshold.

The transposition of the RCD marks for the first time how we treat asylum seekers when they come to Ireland will be set down in law, which we welcome.  We also welcome the committee&rsquo;s engagement on the issue.  As of March 2018, 5,318 people were living in direct provision and the issue, therefore, affects many people.  Transposition will be by way of statutory instrument.  We previously recommended that this be done by way of primary legislation.  Statutory instrument reduces the opportunity for Oireachtas scrutiny of this important issue, while there has been no civil society opportunity for meaningful input into drafting of the statutory instrument.  We have requested several meetings with Department of Justice and Equality officials to discuss the contents of the statutory instrument but have been unsuccessful in doing so.<\/p> <p>  The directive provides for how we treat people in a wide range of ways and not just in the context of the right to work.  It contains provisions relating to detention, vulnerability, education, health and the withdrawal of reception conditions.  The committee is not entirely toothless in respect of the use of statutory instruments.  It could consider, for example, the recommendation of the Joint Committee on European Affairs of the previous D&aacute;il.  The committee produced a report in April 2014 regarding the assessment of current structures for Oireachtas scrutiny of EU affairs.  The 17th recommendation in the report is that \"draft statutory instruments together with an explanatory note be circulated to the relevant committee one month before they are signed\".  That is something the committee could consider.<\/p> <p>  I would like to mention three issues, the first of which is access to the labour market.  Last May, the Supreme Court recognised that people awaiting an asylum decision had a constitutional right to work.  As the chief commissioner of the IHREC said earlier, article 15 of the directive requires that member states must allow for effective access to the labour market.  Unless access is effective, the right recognised by the Supreme Court on 31 May last year will be rendered illusory.  The temporary scheme has been much criticised by a wide spectrum of organisations, including ourselves.  Its restrictive nature is reflected in the fact that as of 1 May, according to a reply by the Minister for Justice and Equality to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, there had only been one application for a work permit.<\/p><p>That is not a decision; it is just a single application.  There have been 368 successful applications for self-employment granted .  This is positive in that it reflects the intention to work, to integrate and to use the skills they have and the experiences of people who are waiting for asylum decisions.  As has been remarked by this committee, however, there are issues regarding the precarious nature of self-employment.<\/p><p> Fundamentally, the work permit process is not designed for asylum seekers.  The work permit process is designed to protect the Irish labour market.  It is designed to identify gaps in the latter and then bring people in from elsewhere to fill those gaps.  The work permit process is entirely inappropriate for people seeking asylum.  A much more generous scheme is required.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan has said - and the Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission recognises - that when Ireland finally opts into the directive, the provisions will be more generous.  However, we have no more information than that.  We understand that there will be a nine-month timeframe but there will continue to be some sort of restricted professions.  When the Minister was before the committee in January, he informed Deputy Clare Daly that he would make provision for a review - or, at least, that a final review would be done in April - and that he would supply its findings to the committee.  Perhaps this could be followed up.  The review could look at labour market gaps of some sort.<\/p><p> It is problematic that there seems to be an approach within the Department to tie Ireland's policy to that of the United Kingdom.  The latter has a very restrictive approach to the right to work; it is only available to people who have waited for 12 months and then they are restricted to applying for a particularly small number of niche jobs on what is known as the shortage occupation list.  We deem this to be problematic, especially in anticipation of Brexit, as two policies diverge.<\/p><p> The Irish Refugee Council calls for the right to work for people who have waited six months, with no restrictions as to the professions they can pursue.  This provision should be immediately available to those who have already waited six months.  This is against the background of long delays in Ireland's asylum procedure.  It is estimated that if a person's case is not prioritised, he or she could be waiting at least 19 months just for an initial interview on the application.<\/p><p> We are also calling for a review of the barriers that make it difficult to access the labour market.  These include: difficulties obtaining driving licences; opening bank accounts; and accessing housing.  In our experience, these barriers exist for people who may have status and who are trying to transition out of direct provision and for those in direct provision who would like to work but who face these difficult problems.<\/p><p> I shall now turn to the issue of the withdrawal of reception conditions.  Article 20 of the directive provides that a member state may reduce or withdraw reception conditions but requires that under no circumstances may a person be left in a state of destitution.  This is very topical to our work at the moment.  Since July of last year, we have worked with 30 people who have had difficulty accessing direct provision accommodation.  This difficulty arises when, for example, a person applies for asylum in Ireland but does not enter direct provision or is in direct provision and then leaves it.  People face difficulties re-entering the direct provision system to the point where we have worked with individuals who have been homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This is very troubling.  It is also in the context of existing homelessness services that are stretched.  An additional problem arises because when a person is not in direct provision, he or she is not entitled to the allowance of &euro;21.60 per week.  Not only is the person without State-provided accommodation, he or she is also without an allowance.  This is of major concern to us.<\/p><p> The Irish Refugee Council calls for Ireland to rule out any situation whereby somebody in need of basic subsistence may be subject to a complete withdrawal of reception conditions.  Any decision regarding the withdrawal of reception conditions must be individual and it must recognise, as the directive does, that everybody is entitled to a dignified standard of living.  Crucially - and this is where Ireland's policy and procedure will be required to change - the directive requires that a person has the right of appeal against the withdrawal of reception conditions.  If a person is told that he or she is not entitled to live in direct provision accommodation, under the directive, he or she would theoretically have the right of appeal.  This measure does not exist under current practice or procedure and it requires change.<\/p><p> The third and final issue that requires quite significant change from existing policy and procedure is the vulnerability assessment required under the directive.  Currently, beyond a basic health screening provided to applicants who choose to avail of direct provision, there is no multidisciplinary assessment of vulnerability of the special needs of people seeking asylum.  This is an important point.  Early and ongoing identification of vulnerability is important, not just to ensure humane living conditions but also to ensure that applicants are supported in engaging with the asylum procedure.  Vulnerability identification leads to better quality decision-making and can reduce delays that are prevalent in the Irish asylum system.  For this to happen, there needs to be training, guidelines and robust systems that can work to identify vulnerability.  It also needs to be cross-departmental to include the Department of Health and the HSE.  This must be set out clearly.  We are slightly concerned that the statutory instrument has the potential to not detail in full how a vulnerability identification mechanism would actually work.<\/p><p> It is important to say that the reception conditions directive provides member states with a wide degree of latitude in transposition and implementation of the legislation.  Article 4 of the directive says that member states may introduce more favourable measures.  In other words, the directive is a floor rather than a ceiling, and we will work towards ensuring this.  The Irish Refugee Council is ready to work with its partner organisations in civil society, with this committee and with the Department of Justice and Equality on how the directive is designed - so far we have been relatively unsuccessful in that regard - and, crucially, on how it will be implemented.  The directive contains a broad range of provisions, the working of which will only be identified when they are rolled out in practice.<\/p><p> I thank the committee and I welcome any questions that members may have.  I reiterate that there is a recommendation from the European Union Affairs committee, and an opportunity for this committee if it wished, to request the statutory instrument from the Department.  It could be provided in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018050900002#L01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nick Henderson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525852800,"counter":948,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Henderson.

As a committee, we need to look at what we should do.  Would it be possible for a statutory instrument to be considered and primary legislation to be dealt with?  Perhaps that is something we should know rather than the council.  Could we do a bit of each?  The directive does not just deal with the right to work, it also covers a range of other provisions.

I am familiar with an asylum seeker who was in a direct provision centre in Waterford.  He is going to school at Col&aacute;iste Dh&uacute;laigh in Dublin.  He was getting the bus up at the beginning of the week and going back down as the weekend approached.  He arrived in December - just before Christmas  -and when he returned to the centre after being in school for the week, he was told that his place was gone.  He asked why and was told that he had been missing too many nights per week even though they knew he was going to school in Dublin.

There are other categories of people such as those who do not enter direct provision possibly because they are reliant on a family member or friend and that situation falls through, as well as those in direct provision who for some reason, leave - possibly to stay with a family member or friend - and that also falls through.

There is a lot of discretion.  There are also things the member state has to do, including the vulnerability assessment.  It is difficult for us to imagine how that can be sufficiently catered for under a statutory instrument, although it may well be.  We are looking at it from the point of view that these are victims of torture, rape, all kinds of situations and medical conditions, which make them very vulnerable.  The ability to properly assess that and to provide the necessary care is a big task.
