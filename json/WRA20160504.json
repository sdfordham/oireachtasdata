Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.<\/p><p>The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.<\/p><p>Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed. <\/p><p>As under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, JobsPlus and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee, the main approach in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation. <\/p><p>The key objective is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement with young people by case officers to assist young people to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  As part of this process additional supports may be  provided, both through existing schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015. <\/p><p><i>Pathways to Work 2016 -2020<\/i>, published in January 2016,<i><\/i>commits to continuing to implement the actions set out in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan (YGIP).  In addition, it commits to four additional actions:<\/p><p>-  Increase the share of workplace-based interventions;<\/p><p>-  Restructure First Steps (a work experience programme for particularly disadvantaged young people);<\/p><p>-  Ensure monthly engagement with young unemployed, at a minimum, is consistently maintained; and<\/p><p>-  Implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme.<\/p><p>The operation and coverage of the Youth Guarantee will be reviewed in mid-2016, based on data on outcomes for young people who became unemployed up to the end of 2015, and in the light of developments in the economy and in the labour market in the context of the overall Pathways to Work strategy. <\/p><p>Implementation of the Youth Guarantee is reviewed independently by the EU.  Ireland has been reviewed twice (in December 2014 and in December 2015) on its implementation of measures to tackle youth unemployment as part of the Youth Guarantee, through the EU Semester multi-lateral surveillance process within the EMCO (Employment Committee).  For the December 2015 review, EMCO concluded:<\/p><p>-  EMCO welcomes the efforts to implement the YG in Ireland and the positive results being experienced in relation to youth unemployment. These positive outcomes should be continued together with efforts to reduce the timespan within which the offer to young people is made.<\/p><p>-  Ireland has introduced several new programmes in 2015, in addition to the pre-existing programmes, offering employment, work experience and training\/developmental internship opportunities to the youth.  Programmes are relevant to address youth labour market challenges and address the issues underlying the YG.  EMCO is looking forward to overall evaluation results of the new initiatives.  Substantial progress has been made in the FET\/VET sector and apprenticeships, aimed at ensuring their relevance to labour market needs.  Ireland has also taken important steps toward reforming the PES and providing a more effective PES engagement process.  As regards the 2014 data collection exercise, data cover those aged 18-24 and in receipt of unemployment benefits.<\/p><p>The following table details the original expected full year intake on relevant programmes for 2015 as well the actual number of starters up to the most recent date for which data are available.  <\/p><p>These data exclude an estimated 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.

Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government. <\/p>  <p>  The current position is that the Department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseeker's payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on\/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week.  Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns. <\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that these customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work\/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they are not paid via post offices under the Department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my Department is seeking to reduce its usage of cheques as a payment method; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the Department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience. <\/p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The evidence available to the Department is that the majority of the Department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible. <\/p>  <p>  Consequently the Department has written to its casual jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions. <\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the Department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices, they are issued directly to the Department&rsquo;s customers.  This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the Department and An Post. <\/p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the Department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions.  This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The Department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment.  The Department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers. <\/p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.  Customers, if they wish, may continue to receive cheque payments in the medium term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400063#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400063#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[8882\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400063#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when she will forward a file from the domiciliary care allowance section to the social protection appeals office for a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>A review of the decision to disallow Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) was requested on 10th September 2015 and the person concerned was notified on 11th December 2015 that following an examination of the file the original decision was upheld. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, the person concerned lodged an appeal on 6th January 2016.

Where a returned emigrant does not qualify for a social insurance payment, he or she may apply for a social assistance payment, such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to qualify for social welfare payments in Ireland an applicant must satisfy the eligibility criteria applicable to the scheme concerned.  In all cases, decisions on the eligibility of persons are made following consideration of all the circumstances of the person concerned.  In addition to having to satisfy a means test and other eligibility criteria directly relevant to the specific payment being claimed, applicants for most social assistance payments must also be determined as being habitually resident in the State in order to qualify.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s published guidelines on the application of the habitual residence condition specifically address the issue of returning emigrants.  Returning emigrants who have previously been habitually resident in the State and who moved to live and work in another country and then resume their long-term residence in the State may be determined as habitually resident in the State immediately on their return to the State.   <\/p>  <p>  Arrangements are in place with Safe-Home Ltd, a registered charity, to assist with any difficulty experienced by a minority of returning emigrants in demonstrating their intention to live in the State permanently for the purposes of satisfying the habitual residence condition.  <\/p>  <p>  The current Intreo decision process is designed to speed up decisions.  Persons applying for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or one-parent family payment would normally be given an early appointment to discuss their application.  Once the requested information is provided to support the application at the subsequent meeting with an official of the Department, there is usually minimal delay in processing the application to decision.

It is designed to be a temporary fixed-term activation intervention.  The programme assists participants to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills which can then be used in the workplace.<\/p><p>A number of persons who sign on to the Live Register generally exit it again within a short timeframe, without any recourse to employment schemes or intensive activation measures.  Accordingly, it is considered appropriate that the CE scheme will remain focused on those who are long-term unemployed.  There are other interventions and activation options operated by the Department for those who are short-term unemployed, for example, advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools. <\/p><p>In general participants can avail of 12 months participation on CE.  There are no plans to extend the standard CE participation period up to two years minimum as this would result in a reduction in throughput from the scheme, thereby reducing the overall number of CE beneficiaries per year.<\/p><p>The standard minimum entry age for CE is 25 years of age.  It is worth noting that the entry age for dedicated childcare and health and social care positions that involve working <i>directly<\/i>with service users was lowered to 21 years of age.  There are no plans to further reduce the standard minimum entry for other positions. <\/p><p>With effect from 3<sup>rd<\/sup>April 2000, lifetime cumulative participation on CE by an individual is limited to 3 years (156 weeks) for persons under 55 years of age and 6 years (312 weeks) for persons of 55 years of age up to and including 65 years of age.  Eligible persons in receipt of a qualifying disability-linked Social Welfare payment are eligible for one additional year on CE over the standard maximum participation caps.  Participation on a CE scheme prior to 3<sup>rd<\/sup>April 2000 is not counted when calculating the length of time a person can participate.  There are no plans to change this date as the duration allows for maximum utilisation of the CE placements amongst the greatest number of participants.  <\/p><p>The CE programme provides funding for participants aged up to 65 years of age who meet the current eligibility criteria.  The T&aacute;naiste announced a pilot initiative in December 2015 to enable those aged 62 and over to extend their participation beyond the standard maximum participation limits (currently set at 6 years cumulative lifetime participation) providing the eligibility conditions are met.  Participants are allowed to participate on a continuous basis up to the State Pension age, subject to satisfactory performance on the scheme and to annual approval by the Department.The places allocated for these participants within each individual CE scheme are limited to 7% of each scheme's overall budgeted places. <\/p><p>With respect to participation by lone parents on CE, in addition to the existing financial supports available, a number of other incentives are in place.  This includes the Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme.  As childcare is a crucial element for parents embarking on CE or returning to the workforce, this programme ensures that CE participants get the childcare supports they need to have a better future for themselves and their families. <\/p><p>The eligibility criteria for CE places is kept under ongoing review to ensure they are effective in targeting long-term unemployed jobseekers and other specific disadvantaged groups.  In the context of the Local Employment Service (LES) it is intended that they provide an intensive engagement with customers which includes a target of 30% of customers placed into full -time employment.  This target does not include those placed into education and training.  While CE schemes are intended to help long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce, they are not full-time sustainable jobs and cannot be included in this target.<\/p><p>If a particular CE scheme is encountering difficulties in recruiting participants, additional assistance can be provided by the local departmental staff to resolve any local barriers or issues.  The Department is committed to enhancing the effectiveness of the CE Programme whilst being conscious of the valuable contribution it is making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400063#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Delays","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400063#WRA03025"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[8909\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400063#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) in County Sligo under the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>I confirm that the Department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) from the person concerned on 14 January 2016.

As stated in the SPU It is envisaged that this level of spending pressure in 2016 can be accommodated within the fiscal rules.<\/p>  <p>  At this stage of the year, the\u00a0amounts of spending pressures by Department cannot be accurately assessed. However, the end-March Exchequer Returns provide some indications of areas where there may be some pressures. \u00a0As outlined in the analysis of Gross Voted Expenditure published with the Exchequer Returns, at the end of the first quarter, Health gross current spending was over profile by &euro;38 million (1.1%).  This would indicate that there is a risk that Health may exceed the allocation set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV) 2016. <\/p>  <p>  Following the flooding in late 2015 and the early part of this year, it is estimated that an additional allocation for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will be required this year to enable necessary recovery and repair work on\u00a0transport infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  While not evident in the end quarter Exchequer returns, it can be anticipated that Departments will have demands for additional resources.  These demands can arise in relation to both current and capital expenditure.  For example, in the Education sector, re-phasing of funding for the school building programme to 2016 would allow earlier completion of some projects. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the aggregate level of spending pressures may\u00a0be somewhat\u00a0mitigated by savings across Government Departments that can emerge later in the year.<\/p>  <p>  The estimates of fiscal space for the period 2017-2021 set out in Table A.9 of the Department of Finance's Budget 2016 publication sets out the walk between the gross fiscal space consistent with the forecast Expenditure Benchmark and the net fiscal space available over the medium term estimated at Budget time in October 2015 that\u00a0after taking account, in relation to Voted expenditure, of:<\/p>  <p>  - projected expenditure pressures in Health, Education and Social Protection arising from demographics;<\/p>  <p>  - projected additional expenditure in Agriculture arising from the roll-out of the Rural Development Programme;<\/p>  <p>  - the projected carry over impact of certain Budget 2016 measures;<\/p>  <p>  - the capital expenditure increases in the Public Capital Plan; and<\/p>  <p>  - savings arising from expected lower numbers on the Live Register.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the fiscal space in Table A.9 of the Budget book is calculated by reference to the Expenditure Benchmark estimated in October 2015, additional expenditure in 2016 may become part of the base expenditure for 2017 and consequently should not be expected to impact on the fiscal space available for subsequent years.  However, as outlined above, expenditure pressures in 2016 may arise on both current and capital expenditure, and, given the favourable treatment of capital formation increases under the Expenditure Benchmark, any impacts on fiscal space can only be fully assessed when the full details of any additional expenditure in 2016 are available and also in light of consideration of the\u00a0impact of the General Government Finance statistics for 2015 recently published\u00a0by the CSO on\u00a0updated estimates of fiscal\u00a0space for 2017.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400069#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1353"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400069#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[9172\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400069#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"to clarify the issue of meetings held over the winter with representatives of the insurance industry; if he has reached agreement on home owners being refused flood cover because of the perceived threat of flooding; if he will advise residents accordingly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1353"},{"type":"speech","counter":212,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) has no role or function in relation to the oversight or regulation of insurance matters.

Subsequently, Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance industry, advised that approximately 98% of property insurance policies nationally include flood cover and that in areas protected by flood defence schemes constructed by the Office of Public Works (OPW), 83% of policies include flood cover.  Insurance Ireland advised that the rate of cover is 89% in areas protected by fixed defences and 78% where the protection includes demountable defences. Demountable defences are used in four of the sixteen schemes that have been completed to the 1:100 year standard, required by the industry.

These programmes are also a critical source of non-Exchequer funding for this important economic activity.  The current EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, which is part of the drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe, is Horizon 2020.  Horizon 2020 has a budget of almost &euro;75 billion and runs over the period 2014-2020.  Irish companies who compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovative capability and competitiveness which in turn this will deliver strong national economic impacts. <\/p>  <p>  In the first 23 months of Horizon 2020, 588 Irish applicants were successful in securing funding.  For this period, Ireland's drawdown was &euro;251 million, giving an overall Irish success rate of 14.62% (higher than the EU Member State average of 13.5%).  Of this funding, over &euro;72 million went to companies and &euro;52 million of the &euro;72 million went to SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  Of the &euro;251 million drawdown, over &euro;9 million was for advanced manufacturing and processing.  It is not possible to disaggregate the total figure for supports for the manufacturing and services sectors as they are included in other calls, such as the SME Instrument.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland performed excellently in the previous Framework Programme, FP7, which ran over the period 2007- 2013.  Ireland&rsquo;s total drawdown in FP7 was &euro;625 million. Of this funding, industry had a drawdown of &euro;164 million and 72% of the industry total (&euro;118.5 million) was drawn down by SMEs.  The total figure for supports in the manufacturing and services sectors cannot be disaggregated from the total FP7 drawdown.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has an ambitious target of winning &euro;1.25 billion under Horizon 2020, which we are on target to meet.  Our strategy to achieve this target is being driven by the Horizon 2020 High Level Group, chaired by my Department.  All Departments and Agencies engaged in research funding are represented on the High Level Group and particular attention is being given to maximising industry participation in Horizon 2020.<\/p>  <p>  80% of the Horizon 2020 budget (&euro;61 billion) is to be allocated between 2016 and 2020, which gives Irish companies the opportunity to continue to availing of these supports.  Irish academics and companies will continue to be supported in their engagement with the opportunities available by the Horizon 2020 National Support System.  The National Support System is coordinated by Enterprise Ireland and the National Director for Horizon 2020 leads a team comprised of representatives across the research funding departments and agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400069#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400069#WRG02000"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[8925\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400069#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the extent to which lack of working capital continues to be identified by indigenous small enterprises in the manufacturing sector and in the services sector as an obstacle to expansion; the degree to which he has brought these issues to the attention of the relevant authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>Over the last five years the Government has worked tirelessly to ensure that the access of SMEs to an appropriate supply of financing from both bank and non-bank sources is improved and that all businesses have access to appropriate sources of finance to grow develop and expand.  A number of key policy and legislative initiatives were developed and delivered since March 2011 with some being reviewed and amended as necessary, and these may be grouped as follows:-<\/p><p><i>Credit Guarantees<\/i><\/p><p>- The Credit Guarantee Act 2012, and Schemes made thereunder, have resulted in encouragement of bank lending to Irish SMEs to both create new jobs and protect existing ones. To date approx. &euro;50 million of loans have been sanctioned in more than 300 facilities, and some 2200 jobs were created\/maintained;<\/p><p>- The 2012 Act was reviewed in 2014-2015, and, in February of this year, the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act, 2016 was enacted. New Schemes are currently being drafted to extend the remit of credit guarantees (covering expanded forms of lending, and greater risk sharing), and introduce new counter guarantees to enhance the provision of both State and EU-sourced finance for Irish SMEs;<\/p><p><i>Microfinance Ireland (MFI)<\/i><\/p><p>- The Microenterprise Loan Fund Act, 2012 established MFI to provide loans of up to &euro;25,000 to Irish micro-enterprises.  To date approx. &euro;13 million was been loaned to 870 firms, with more than 2000 jobs being created\/maintained.<\/p><p>- As with credit guarantees, the operation of MFI was reviewed in 2015, and a number of changes were made to ease access to loans primarily, via the removal of the previous pre-requisite of a bank loan rejection. The legislative  changes have resulted in a substantial increase in the activities both nationally and regionally in the last year and a half. <\/p><p><i>Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI)<\/i><\/p><p>- The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014 established the SBCI, and tasked it to provide up to &euro;800m of funds for Irish SMEs previously over reliant on bank financing.  This tranche of funding has now been fully committed to business.<\/p><p><i>Prompt Payments Code (PPC) <\/i><\/p><p>- In May 2015, the Government launched the PPC to encourage and promote best practice between businesses and suppliers and improve cash flow for businesses and, ultimately, drive a change in the payment culture in Ireland.<\/p><p><i>Credit Review Office<\/i><\/p><p>- The Credit Review Office continues to review applications for credit made by SMEs or Farm borrowers with viable business propositions who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank or Ulster Bank.<\/p><p>- The Credit Review Office also examines cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loans, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.<\/p><p>My Department Officials continue to work with other Departmental and Agency officials through the State Bodies Group chaired by the Department of Finance to ensure appropriate financing options are available to SMEs, and are currently continuing to work on developing an export finance strategy with the objective of delivering a product to market this year in line with commitments in the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 in this area.

Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of information on the courts system.  I am informed that the Courts Service does not receive or record information in such a way as to determine if a property is vacant or non-vacant prior to a possession order being made.  However, statistics in relation to the number of possession orders made in respect of properties are available on the Courts Service website, www.courts.ie.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the number of civil bills issued does not reflect either the number of orders for possession granted or necessarily equate with repossessions as it is up to the person or company who obtained the order for possession to pursue its execution.<b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b>Therefore, relative to the number of civil bills issued, a small portion end up as repossessions since in many cases the civil bill gives rise to engagement of the borrower with the bank resulting in either a mortgage  restructuring agreement between the bank and borrower or a Personal Insolvency Arrangement entered into under the Personal Insolvency Act.<\/p><p>The Central Bank's quarterly Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossession Statistics have information which may be of interest to the Deputies and they are available at www.centralbank.ie.  The statistics include the number of properties taken into possession by lenders during the relevant quarter including the number which were repossessed on foot of a Court Order.<\/p><p>I would like to refer the Deputies to the range of measures that have already been put in place under the Government's Framework to Strengthen Support of Mortgage Arrears with the aim of providing assistance for people in mortgage arrears, including:<\/p><p>- the enactment on 28 July 2015 of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015, and commencement on 20 November 2015 of the new Court review under section 115A, where banks refuse a personal insolvency proposal on the borrower&rsquo;s home; <\/p><p>- the development of Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) as the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop shop&rsquo; point of information and guidance for homeowners in mortgage arrears, working closely with the Insolvency Service;<\/p><p>- the establishment and staffing of Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS centres, in key locations with nationwide coverage, with specialised expertise on mortgage debt; and<\/p><p>- the presence of MABS and the Insolvency Service at courthouses to provide information and &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; support for householders issued with repossession proceedings against their homes (operating nationwide since 1 October, after successful pilot in July 2015).  This initiative is facilitated by the Courts Service, and is currently provided for all Circuit Court repossession hearings. <\/p><p>In addition, the Government will shortly be putting in place a new Government-funded Scheme to help people who are insolvent, and in mortgage arrears on their home, to access independent expert financial and legal advice. The scheme has 3 components:<\/p><p>(i) Provision of financial advice and assistance. <\/p><p>This involves the provision of advice and assistance from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, or other financial adviser as appropriate, drawn from panels agreeing to provide specified levels and amounts of services under the Scheme at fixed cost.  This will be provided without cost to an insolvent borrower, under a &lsquo;voucher&rsquo; system, and will be accessed through MABS, working in conjunction with the Insolvency Service and the accountancy bodies. <\/p><p>(ii) Provision of legal advice and assistance.<\/p><p>This involves the provision of advice and assistance from a solicitor, drawn from panels to be set up by the Legal Aid Board, who agrees to provide specified levels and amounts of services under the Scheme at fixed cost.  The scheme will provide assistance and representation for insolvent borrowers in repossession proceedings involving their home, via a panel of &lsquo;duty solicitors&rsquo; at repossession hearings, operated by the Legal Aid Board. <\/p><p>Again, this assistance will be provided without cost to an insolvent borrower, under a &lsquo;voucher&rsquo; system, and will be accessed through MABS, working in conjunction with the Legal Aid Board.<\/p><p>(iii) Provision of legal aid.<\/p><p>This involves the provision of legal aid for insolvent borrowers seeking the new Court review under section 115A Personal of the Insolvency Acts, where a borrower&rsquo;s proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement including mortgage arrears on their home is refused by their creditors.  This component will be operated by the Legal Aid Board. <\/p><p>The overall objective of the Scheme is to help people who are insolvent (unable to pay their debts in full as they fall due), and are in serious mortgage arrears on their homes, to access independent expert financial and\/or legal advice and assistance, which will help them to find the best possible solutions, with the aim of remaining in their homes where possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400072#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400072#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[8988\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400072#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive an outcome on an application for a pension under Article 15; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":312,"content":"<p>I am informed that there is no record, in the Garda Pensions Administration section of the Department, of an application for an Article 15 pension in respect of this person.<\/p><p>However, the eligibility of the person in this case for such a pension has been reviewed and it appears that she is not eligible for this particular pension.<\/p><p>The Garda Pensions Administration section will shortly contact the person in this case directly to confirm this position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400072#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commissions of Inquiry","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400072#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[9169\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400072#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to order the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the death of a person (details supplied), given the concerns regarding the investigation of this person's death, and the allegations of political interference in that investigation.","asker":"1259","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[8854\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400072#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to accede to a request by persons for a commission of inquiry into the disappearance of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>As I have set out in responses to previous parliamentary questions in relation to this case, the disappearance of the person in question remains the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation and I am advised that the Garda Review Team is endeavouring to advance the investigation and that all avenues of investigation are being pursued in this regard.

It was introduced in acknowledgment that prisoners must have access to a credible and robust system that deals with genuine complaints in an open, transparent, and independent way.  <\/p>  <p>  The system is categorised depending on the nature of the complaint.  Category A complaints concern the most serious level of complaint (assault, serious intimidation by staff etc.).  Category B complaints include allegations of discrimination, verbal abuse by officers and inappropriate searches.  Category C complaints are essentially service complaints where a prisoner is unhappy with the level of service in a particular prison.  Category D complaints are those alleging misconduct or mistreatment by professionals providing services to prisoners such as doctors, dentists etc.<\/p>  <p>  To support and give effect to these new complaint procedures the then Minister announced amendments to the Prison Rules in January 2013.  In the main, the amendments provide that prisoner complaints under Category A will be examined by investigators from outside the Prison Service to ensure an effective and impartial investigation.  The complainant is to be kept informed and the reports by outside investigators are automatically submitted to the Governor in question, the Director General and the Inspector of Prisons.  The Inspector has had oversight of the process from the very beginning which was also strengthened by extra resources assigned to his office. <\/p>  <p>  A panel of 22 Independent Investigators was established following a selection and interview process.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, in addition to the complaints system described above, a prisoner may make a complaint about treatment in custody through a number of other channels, including the Prison Visiting Committee and the Inspector of Prisons.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Inspector of Prisons, who is independent of Government, has carried out a review of the prisoner complaints procedure currently in operation in the Irish Prison Service and has made a number of recommendations, including one relating to a possible role for an Ombudsman.

Most significant is the fact that a criminal gang is not likely to have the permanency of organisation and structure that a subversive organisation or other more fixed group would have.  Relationships in criminal gangs tend to be more fluid with shifting memberships,  alliances and a membership which may depend on circumstance.  <\/p>  <p>  I therefore understand the Deputy's question to relate to organised criminal groups.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, criminal legislation has been updated in recent years, with a view to  ensuring that it provides a comprehensive range of provisions for the prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular the activities of those involved in organised crime. <\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 (as amended by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009) establishes a number of offences targeting the activities of those involved in organised crime.  These offences include participation in a criminal organisation and directing a criminal organisation.  The latter offence specifically targets those in criminal organisations who give the orders without requiring their direct participation in the commission of criminal offences.  On conviction, this offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment. <\/p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 also makes it an offence to conspire with one or more persons to do an act that constitutes a serious offence, irrespective of whether such act actually takes place or not.     <\/p>  <p>  Evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation were introduced aiding prosecution for the offences under the Act.  Provision was also introduced so that where a serious offence is committed as part of or in furtherance of a criminal organisation, it shall be treated as an aggravating factor for the purpose of determining sentence.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the situation internationally, the question of how best to deal with participation in and\/or directing a criminal organisation through the criminal law has been the subject of debate in the development of common international standards. Relevant international instruments to which Ireland is a party are the European Union Council Framework Decision 2008\/841\/JHA on the fight against organised crime and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime.  State Parties to these instruments are required to give effect to the measures set out therein.  Ireland has done so through domestic criminal law including the legislation outlined above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400073#WRL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400073#WRL01250"},{"type":"question","counter":343,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[8915\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400073#WRL01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will increase over the next twelve months, given natural retirements and resignations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":344,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

Since the economic downturn the limited funding available to this Department has been targeted to support the refurbishment and maintenance of childcare facilities in which there has already been considerable investment. <\/p>  <p>  I announced earlier this year the introduction of an Early Years Capital Programme 2016 with total funding of &euro;4 million available.  This funding is targeted at early years pre-school providers that are making alterations to their services to accommodate the increased numbers of children eligible for the free pre-school provision following my decision to expand the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The number of children availing of the programme will increase from approximately 67,000 per year to 127,000 per year following the full roll out of the expanded pre-school provision.  <\/p>  <p>  Last year, I established the Inter-Departmental Group to consider options for future investment in early years and after-school childcare and to set out a range of options for future investment which would enhance affordability, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years and after-school childcare.  <\/p>  <p>  Several recommendations of the Group, including a number which relate to after-school childcare, were considered as part of the Estimates process for the Budget and will also be funded in 2016.

These include:<\/p>  <p>  - The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme that provides after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  Eligibility for the programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school. The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods. In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child. <\/p>  <p>  - The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case. The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks. Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection. <\/p>  <p>  - The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p>  <p>  - The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400074#WRM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children's Rights","counter":376,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400074#WRM02000"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[8853\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400074#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he received a submission from the Children's Rights Alliance in respect of the serious issues for children and young persons as outlined in the programme for Government 2011 to 2016; his plans to implement any recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>I have received from the Children's Rights Alliance a copy of its recently published Report Card 2016.

Ongoing engagement and dialogue with the youth sector organisations and with young people themselves are priorities in the development of the policies and services to support young people&rsquo;s development and learning. Most recently, on 28th April 2016 I and officials from my Department met with representatives of over 30 national and major regional voluntary youth organisations that work with children and young people, throughout the country.

It was the case that only children who satisfied the age criteria in September could access the programme during the following school year.<\/p><p>In Budget 2016, I announced a significant expansion the pre-school provision under the ECCE programme.

Following the introduction of the expanded programme there will be three opportunities each year - in September, January and April - for eligible children to enrol for the free pre-school provision.

To address this issue, I announced in Budget 2016 the necessary funding to implement a new practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability.  The model will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme.

As a result of these measures, the ED performance over the Easter period was favourable compared with 2015. <\/p>  <p>  During 2015, additional funding of &euro;117 million was provided to the HSE to relieve ED overcrowding pressures.  This funding has supported initiatives to expand hospital capacity with 364 additional beds opened or reopened, reduce the number of hospital attendances by expanding community intervention team services and increasing the availability of community hospitals, and support timely patient discharge from hospital by reducing the wait time for Fair Deal funding to no more than 4 weeks, providing additional transitional care places, public community beds and home care packages. <\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of 2016, the HSE has reported an increase in emergency department (ED) activity in comparison with the same period last year.

These initiatives include optimising discharges in advance of the weekends, strengthening the senior decision making presence at wards and in EDs, increased access to diagnostics and securing staff to open overflow areas.<\/p>  <p>  During 2015, additional funding of &euro;117 million was provided to the HSE to relieve ED overcrowding pressures.  This funding has supported initiatives to expand hospital capacity with 364 additional beds opened or reopened, reduce the number of hospital attendances by expanding community intervention team services and increasing the availability of community hospitals, and support timely patient discharge from hospital by reducing the wait time for Fair Deal funding to no more than 4 weeks, providing additional transitional care places, public community beds and home care packages.<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of 2016, the HSE has reported an increase of 6.9% in patient attendances in comparison with the same period last year. However, the total year to date number of patients waiting on trolleys at 8am each morning has shown a marginal increase of 1%.<\/p>  <p>  This year, the HSE is focusing on a number of key activities to manage waiting lists more effectively, thereby improving patient waiting times. These include; ensuring that chronological scheduling is adhered to, putting in place validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment, relocating high-volume low complexity surgeries to smaller hospitals; and designating an improvement lead for each hospital group.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to possible underutilisation of surgical beds, the ED escalation framework states that reviews of elective admissions should be carried out by hospital management in consultation with the relevant consultant. It is only at Stage 3 of escalation that all admissions are to be carried out through the Emergency Department and that elective surgeries are cancelled.<\/p>  <p>  Stage 3 requires that elective staff are redeployed to assist with patient flow through the ED. This can impact on staffing and bed capacity in surgical wards. Taking into account the immediate and short term predictable demand\/capacity scenario, decisions on hospital admissions and bed management have to be taken with regard to the safe operating limits of the hospital as a whole and in the interests of patient care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400078#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":510,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400078#WRQ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":511,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[9008\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400078#WRQ02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he will make staffing resources available to make the magnetic resonance imaging scanner fully operational in University Hospital Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18 November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister  for Education and Skills.<\/p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll-out of the new inclusive preschools model.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional pre-school supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case she has raised.

In advance of registration inspections, HIQA sends posters and information leaflets to registered centres so that residents and their families are aware that inspectors will be there should they wish to speak to them.  Because of the nature of unannounced inspections, it is not possible to give residents or their families advance notice of the inspection; however, inspectors are always interested and willing to hear the views of families.  There have been instances where families were not able to meet inspectors at the time of inspection but have phoned HIQA and spoken to inspectors at a later date.<\/p>  <p>  The views of residents are very important in any inspection and inspectors seek opportunities to speak to residents.

The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent. <\/p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.  It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.<\/p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants.  An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400085#WRX02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":737,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 251 and 252 answered with Question No. 240.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400086#WRY00250"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[9002\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400086#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out the status of an application for an additional teacher by a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":740,"content":"<p>The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts for the 2016\/2017 school year is set out in Circular 0007\/2016.

YEI funding is reserved for use in those regions, including Ireland, where youth unemployment levels exceeded 25% during the reference year of 2012.  The specific YEI funding allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our European Social Fund (ESF) allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.<\/p><p>The YEI is integrated into ESF programming and is being delivered in Ireland as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Education, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020.  Seven specific actions are being funded under the YEI, namely the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance; JobBridge; JobsPlus Incentive Scheme; T&uacute;s; Youthreach; Social Inclusion and Activation Programme; and Momentum.  The proposed funding allocations for each of these actions, including YEI funding, is set out in the following table. These actions are underway and are being fully funded up-front by the Exchequer. <\/p><p>In accordance with the ESF Regulations, following the adoption of the PEIL in 2015, initial pre-financing of 3.5%, and annual pre-financing of 2% for 2016, of the EU support for the YEI priority axis, amounting to some &euro;7.5m has been received to date.Separately, additional initial pre-financing of &euro;19.8m, to bring the rate to 30% in 2015 of the YEI allocation, has also been received.  This additional funding was provided in line with EU Regulation 799 of 2015 which was introduced in response to budgetary constraints faced by Member States and the urgent need to address youth unemployment.  However, in an attempt to ensure that the funding was used for the immediate implementation of the YEI, the Regulation provides that if a Member State does not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.<\/p><p>In accordance with the Regulations governing the European Structural and Investment Funds (including the ESF and the YEI), the relevant managing and certifying authorities for the Operational Programme must be designated, based on the opinion of an independent audit body which must be satisfied across a range of criteria that systems are in place to allow the authorities to perform their required functions, prior to the making of any application for an interim payment under the Regulations.  The systems designation requirements include the provision of a computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements.  The Regulations require Member States to ensure that all exchanges of information between beneficiaries and the relevant authorities and intermediate bodies can be carried out by means of electronic data exchange systems (known as E-Cohesion).  These systems will facilitate interoperability with national and Union frameworks and allow for the beneficiaries to submit information only once.<\/p><p>Ireland is developing a national IT system to meet the 2014-2020 ESIF requirements.  A Project Board, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as the Department with lead responsibility, is overseeing the delivery of this system.  A tender for the development of the system was published in March and the deadline for the receipt of applications was Friday, 29 April.  It is expected that the system will &quot;go-live&quot; in December.<\/p><p>The intention is that the ESF authorities will be designated later this year and that a claim for an interim payment under the PEIL will be made in 2017.  Accordingly, as Ireland will not comply with the relevant Regulatory requirement of making an interim claim in May 2016, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received and currently held in a Suspense Account, may be reimbursed to the Commission. <\/p><p>However, it should be noted that the reimbursement of this pre-financing will not result in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer, as the full YEI allocation of &euro;68m to Ireland will still be available for drawdown before year-end 2018, and it is expected that this funding will be fully drawn down.  Furthermore, as the activities concerned are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction in the funding available to those activities.<table><tr><th><b>Youth Employment Initiative<\/b><\/th><th><div><b>Funding (&euro;m)<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) Scheme<\/td><td><div>4.648<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobsPlus Incentive Scheme<\/td><td><div>7.992<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s<\/td><td><div>35.347<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme<\/td><td><div>57.240<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Youthreach<\/td><td><div>79.876<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Momentum<\/td><td><div>13.333<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Social Inclusion and Activation Programme (SICAP)<\/td><td><div>6.000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL<\/b><\/td><td><div><b>204.436<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><table><tr><th><b>Youth Employment Initiative<\/b><\/th><th><div><b>Funding (&euro;m)<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) Scheme<\/td><td><div>4.648<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobsPlus Incentive Scheme<\/td><td><div>7.992<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s<\/td><td><div>35.347<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme<\/td><td><div>57.240<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Youthreach<\/td><td><div>79.876<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Momentum<\/td><td><div>13.333<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Social Inclusion and Activation Programme (SICAP)<\/td><td><div>6.000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL<\/b><\/td><td><div><b>204.436<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400087#WRZ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":789,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400088#WRAA00250"},{"type":"question","counter":790,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[9109\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400088#WRAA00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of special needs assistants and Montessori schools; her views on correspondence regarding a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In relation to rent stability, the Act provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies is being increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a 4 year period.  In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced. Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment.<\/p><p>Further provisions to support rent stability in the 2015 Act include:<\/p><p>- that notice of new rent sent must be in a prescribed form, include details of dispute resolution procedures available through the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and be accompanied by details of rent in respect of 3 comparable dwellings in the area;<\/p><p>- that notification of a rent increase to the RTB will include, among other things, a signed statement by the tenant that they are aware of their rights in relation to rent and rent reviews.<\/p><p>With regard to the termination of a tenancy, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced strengthened protections applying to tenancy terminations in order to safeguard against terminations on false grounds.  These measures involve, inter alia, a landlord having to make a statutory declaration as to their intention to sell a property.  These provisions will be commenced on 9 May 2016.<\/p><p>Ultimately, a lack of supply and competition in the residential sector is putting upward pressure on rents and the key to addressing rising rents in the medium to long term is through increasing the supply of all forms of housing.  The Government is addressing this on a number of fronts, including through <i>Construction 2020; A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector and the Social Housing Strategy 2020<\/i>.<\/p><p>In that regard, a number of important measures have been taken aimed at improving housing delivery viability and increasing supply, including the introduction of a vacant site levy; reductions in development contributions and a targeted development contribution rebate scheme in Dublin and Cork to encourage large scale developments at affordable prices; revised Part V provisions and legislative amendments to introduce greater flexibility and streamlining to the Strategic Development Zone provisions of the Planning and Development Acts.  The actions taken under <i>Construction 2020<\/i>are complemented by the ongoing implementation of the <i>Social Housing Strategy<\/i>and the plans by NAMA to fund the delivery of 20,000 residential units by 2020.<\/p><p><i>Laying the Foundations: Housing Actions Report<\/i>, which was published on 14 April 2016, provides further information on thirty-one major actions taken across the housing spectrum since mid-2014 to increase the supply of housing.  The report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at - <\/p><p>In recognition of the difficulty faced by households in accessing the housing market, an affordable rental pilot scheme was announced as part of Budget 2016, with &euro;10 million being made available to fund a pilot in 2016.  The details of the Scheme are currently being developed by my Department with a view to roll-out later this year.<\/p><p>The Scheme will involve an ongoing annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions.  The pilot Scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall.  It is intended that the scheme would be made available to employed households on low to moderate incomes, as well as being a possible support option for some households who qualify for social housing support.  A State policy intervention - such as a subsidy - would be applied to bridge the gap between what people can afford, and what the housing market charges. Such a scheme would also be expected to facilitate and incentivise private investment into this sector.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that an extensive range of housing measures have been undertaken within my powers as Minister and having regard to legal and financial constraints.  These measures are outlined in the aforementioned Housing Actions Report.  The residential construction sector in Ireland has undergone a very significant shock in recent years and housing output must be kept under review and further action taken as appropriate to ensure that supply returns to the levels required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400090#WRCC00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Stations Provision","counter":855,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400090#WRCC00350"},{"type":"question","counter":856,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[8948\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400090#WRCC00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the timeframe for tendering for a new fire station in Tuam, County Galway; when construction will commence and when the fire station will be operational; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1260","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":857,"content":"<p>The provision of fire services in local authority areas, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of premises, is a statutory function of the individual fire authorities under the provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981.

Following the necessary preparatory work the new Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016.  The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible tenants must meet certain conditions including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income is determined by the relevant housing authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the new Scheme the discounts are linked to tenant income and can be 40%, 50% or 60% of the purchase price.  On sale of a house under the Scheme, the housing authority will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equivalent to the discount granted to the tenant.  Generally, the charge withers away over a period of 20, 25 or 30 years depending on the level of discount received.<\/p>  <p>  Where a tenant purchaser wishes to re-sell the house during the charge period he or she must seek the   consent of the housing authority to the resale.  In such cases, the housing authority also has the first option to buy back the house. If the tenant purchaser sells the house in the charge period, he or she must pay to the housing authority the current value of the outstanding charge.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provides for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.<\/p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in March 2016 projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions in 2020 could be in the range of 6-11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis, Ireland will have a deficit of between 4 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2 e).  The projections suggest that Ireland may have a cumulative deficit of units in 2018 or 2019.  Some of this deficit can be addressed by means of the retirement of units carried forward from the 2008-2012 period, and some additional purchases may be required depending on the out-turn.\u00a0 It is not possible to quantify these at present, having regard to both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.   <\/p>  <p>  A Member State demonstrating compliance with an annual target retires Annual Emissions Allocations (or units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexible Mechanisms) approximately 18 months after the year end, so it is unlikely that any expenditure required will occur before 2020 at the earliest. <\/p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government must submit a National Mitigation Plan to Government for approval by June 2017 at the latest.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.<\/p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this low carbon transition vision by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400092#WREE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Accommodation","counter":920,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400092#WREE00850"},{"type":"question","counter":921,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[9090\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016050400092#WREE00900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the minimum distance limit between accommodation units on temporary Traveller halting sites.","asker":"1305","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":922,"content":"<p>Section 8.14 of the Guidelines for Traveller Accommodation - Basic Services and Facilities for Caravans Pending the Provision of Permanent Accommodation (1998), as provided for under section 29 of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, sets out that, generally, there should be a minimum separation distance of 6m between caravans and 9m between a caravan and a building or other structure.
