CSO data shows that the youth unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2014 had fallen from 33% in mid-2012 to 27% or 25% when seasonally-adjusted. The number of young people unemployed has fallen by 23,400 from 76,000 to 52,600 over the same period. <\/p><p>  There has also been an improvement in the duration of youth unemployment. Two years ago, 46% of the young unemployed were more than a year out of work, and this has now fallen to 35%. As a result, the number of young people who are long-term unemployed has almost halved, from 35,200 to 18,500. While this progress is welcome, the current rate is, I believe, unacceptably high. <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy to tackle all forms of unemployment is being achieved through the actions set out in the Action Plan for Jobs and in Pathways to Work.   In relation to young people, these overall policies are further supported by the measures set out in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan published earlier this year.  <\/p><p>  The Plan provides for enhancing the Intreo engagement with newly unemployed young people, and for building on and adding to the current range of education, training and employment interventions for young people. <\/p><p>  Processes and programmes are being progressively rolled out to ensure that all of newly unemployed young people who need most support will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months. In addition, during 2014&ndash;2015 all existing long-term unemployed young people under 25 will be engaged by the Public Employment Service and will receive a Youth Guarantee offer if still unemployed after four months of this engagement process commencing. <\/p><p>  Taking existing and planned provision together, the current estimate of programme uptake by approximately 28,000 young people in 2014 will involve associated programme costs of &euro;336 million. If all Post-Leaving Certificate course and apprenticeship provision were to be included, the total programme uptake of approximately 52,000 has associated annual programme costs of &euro;528 million. <\/p><p>  I am confident that the funding is in place to finance these measures. It is being provided, in the first instance, by the Irish Exchequer through the budgetary process.

The preserved benefit which is payable from a defined benefit pension scheme will normally be revalued annually by the lower of 4% or the rate of change in the Consumer Price Index.<\/p><p>  Section 50 of the Pensions Act provides for the restructuring of the benefits in a defined benefit pension scheme in situations where the scheme does not satisfy the scheme funding requirement as set out in the Pension Act. In the event that the trustees of a scheme are considering a restructure of scheme benefits under this provision, they can consider adjusting the benefits of both active and deferred scheme members. The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013 extended the provisions in section 50 to include a portion of benefits payable to pensioners.<\/p><p>  These provisions in section 50 of the Act essentially provide for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members.

The wind up priority order was amended by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013.

The Department of Social Protection helps to prevent child poverty by providing income support for families through child benefit, qualified child increases for welfare recipients, family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, amounting to &euro;2.3 billion in 2014.  Through these and other social transfers, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children is reduced from 45 per cent to 18.8 per cent, a poverty reduction effect of 59 per cent.<\/p><p>  Ireland is amongst the best performing member states in the EU in this regard. In Budget 2015, the Government committed a further &euro;96 million for children, including an increase of &euro;5 per month in child benefit.<\/p><p>  In order to break the cycle of child poverty where this arises, the Government invests in prevention and early intervention services targeted at disadvantaged children through the Area Based Childhood programme and the DEIS programme.<\/p><p>  Finally, a key way to tackle child poverty is to get parents back to work.  Through Pathways to Work and the Action Plan on Jobs, the Government is putting people into real jobs, while the family income supplement and new back to work family dividend supports parents to take up and remain in employment , especially those furthest from the labour market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400055#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400055#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[41704\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400055#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will ensure all job-related training activation programmes will be accessible to persons with disabilities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>The Government recognises the importance of increasing participation in employment for persons with a disability and is committed to removing any barriers which prevent those persons with disabilities from participating in activation programmes and employment.

The social insurance system is mandatory and insures nearly all workers and the self-employed for a range of contingencies such as old age, ill health, maternity and unemployment.  The range of contingencies covered is dependent on the Class of PRSI paid.  <br\/><br\/>Social insurance spending has traditionally been funded on a tripartite basis &ndash; with contributions coming from the Exchequer, employers and employees.  Legally, the Exchequer is the residual financier of the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and Exchequer contributions were the norm for over 40 years.  The Revised Estimates provides for a subvention of &euro;0.69 billion from voted expenditure to fund the deficit on the SIF in 2014. <br\/><br\/>One of my key priorities as Minister for Social Protection is to balance the books, in particular by starting to put the Social Insurance Fund on a sustainable footing.  A core principle of sustainable social protection systems in advanced economies is that citizens receive benefits in proportion to their contributions.  <br\/><br\/>The structural PRSI measures implemented in recent Budgets will have a positive and long-term impact on the funding of the SIF.  These measures include increases in rates of contribution, the abolition of ceilings for charging PRSI, the abolition of relief from PRSI previously applied to employee pension contributions, the abolition of the PRSI-free allowance as well as the broadening of the base on which PRSI is charged through the abolition of exemptions.  These revenue raising measures were accompanied by very extensive expenditure reducing measures including stricter contribution conditions for entitlement, reductions in duration of entitlement, removal of entitlement to concurrent social insurance payments, increases in pension age as well as major reductions in entitlements under the treatment benefits and redundancy payments schemes.  The 2015 Budget Estimate has provided for the Exchequer Subvention to fall to &euro;248 million in 2015.<br\/><br\/>The sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund is driven by:<blockquote>i. Social Insurance Fund Income from PRSI receipts;<br \/><br \/>ii. Expenditure on SIF schemes &ndash; the main variables being demographic pressures relating to pensions and the Live Register.<\/blockquote>Social Insurance Fund income peaked at over &euro;8.1 billion in 2008.  It fell to &euro;6.7 billion by 2010.  The 2015 Budget Estimate is forecasting that it will be &euro;8.2 billion, exceeding the pre-crash value for the first time.<br\/><br\/>Arising from demographic pressures, expenditure on pensions is increasing by &euro;200 million each year.<br\/><br\/>The Live Register rose from an average of 162,000 in 2007 to over 440,000 in 2010 and 2011.  It has since fallen each year and is expected to average below 390,000 in 2014.<br\/><br\/>The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December, 2010, highlighted the growing deficit in the Fund and the prospect that it will, in the absence of measures to address the deficit, accelerate further in the future, driven primarily by pension costs.  It is estimated that in excess of &euro;900m additional provision will be required over the next 5 years to fund increases in the numbers of recipients of the State pension (contributory) scheme.<br\/><br\/>Based on macro-economic forecasts provided by the Department of Finance, it is expected that Social Insurance Fund income will continue to rise over the period 2016 to 2018 by an amount greater than the requirement for additional pension expenditure.  Assuming current level of service (including no rate increases for pensioners and other recipients), the Social Insurance Fund will return to surplus in 2016.  There has been no rate increases since the first Budget of 2009.<br\/><br\/>Throughout the crisis, this Government protected core welfare rates and maintained a massively strong social welfare safety net.  The Programme for Government commitment is to retain core weekly social welfare rates of payment.  This Government has successfully achieved this objective over the last four Budgets.

These are set out in Article 238 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.  The revised system of qualified majority voting (QMV), which came into effect on 1 November, requires a double majority, that is, a majority of at least 55% of the number of member states (currently at least 15 Member States), and also of at least 65% of the total population of the Union. It is also provided, in effect, that a blocking minority must consist of at least 4 Member States.<\/p><p>  These arrangements were extensively debated in the European Convention of 2002-2003 and were agreed during Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency of 2004. The aim of introducing the double majority voting rule was to make decision making in the Union simpler and more efficient and effective. It was also believed that it better reflected the dual nature of the Union as a Union of States and of peoples.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to safeguard our interests within the EU will not be materially affected by the move to double majority voting. The new system offers clarity and improves the overall efficiency of decision making. It is important to note that while the provisions on population tend to favour larger member states, the requirement regarding a majority of member states are to the benefit of the smaller states. It ensures that decisions in the EU cannot be taken unless they command genuine support from a majority of member states representing a significant majority of the EU&rsquo;s population.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400055#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400055#WRB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":101,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[40616\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400055#WRB02400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of persons at work in the economy when the Government came to power and the present figure; if these figures include part-time workers and workers in labour activation schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":102,"content":"<p>The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of estimates of employment in the State. <br\/><br\/>Participants on the following Activation Programmes would be classified as employed (ILO) in the QNHS.<b><br\/><br\/>Back to Work Schemes<\/b><br\/><br\/>Back to Work allowance scheme - Employee strand<br\/><br\/>Back to Work Enterprise allowance scheme - self employed strand<br\/><br\/>Short-term Enterprise Allowance<br\/><br\/><b>Other Activation Programmes<\/b><br\/><br\/>DSP Part-time Job Incentive <br\/><br\/>TUS - Community Work Placement Initiative (2011) <br\/><br\/>JobBridge (2011) <br\/><br\/><b>Community Employment Schemes<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>Back to Education courses<\/b><br\/><br\/>Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)<br\/><br\/>Back to Education Allowance (BTEA)<br\/><br\/>Those on Back to Education courses may engage in employment<b>. <\/b>Depending on their labour force situation they are classified based on the ILO labour force definition used in the QNHS<br\/><br\/>Table 1 below shows the seasonally adjusted series of persons aged 15 years and over in employment (ILO) from Q1 2011 to Q2 2014.

constitutional amendment to give citizens a say in the nomination process for Presidential candidates, and this has been done. The Government also undertook to look at making Article 41.2 of the Constitution on the role of women gender-neutral, and at including other carers both in and beyond the home; it also undertook to look at amending the Constitution to include the principle of gender equality, as well as at the use of gender-inclusive language in the Constitution.<br\/><br\/>The Government also announced earlier this year that work would commence on the establishment of an Electoral Commission, a key recommendation in the fourth Report of the Convention.

I am pleased to say that I am in a position to partially restore the Bonus this year. A bonus of 25% will be paid in early December to all long-term welfare recipients including all pensioners and carers. I am taking this initiative in recognition of the fact that most social welfare recipients rely either wholly or mainly on their weekly payment.<\/p><p>  There will be an increase in the living alone allowance of &euro;1.30 per week from January, bringing the rate up from &euro;7.70 to &euro;9 for pensioners and people with disabilities.  The living alone allowance is a payment made to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone and was last increased in 1996. <\/p><p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities, I have introduced a water support payment of &euro;100 to recipients of the Household Benefit Package, to help older people and other vulnerable groups meet the cost of water services.<\/p><p>  In addition, I also introduced a payment of &euro;100 per annum to fuel allowance recipients who are not in receipt of the Household Benefits Package. This measure will also work to alleviate the impact of water costs.<\/p><p>  As well as the measures mentioned above, all existing welfare payments and supports for pensioners will be maintained in 2015 &ndash; there will be no reductions.

There are approximately 73,500 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million in 2014.<\/p><p>  Rent supplement is subject to a statutory maximum limit on the amount of rent that a recipient may incur and is based on the location of the residence and family composition. The Department is currently reviewing the maximum rent limits, which are generally reviewed every 18 months. The purpose of a rent review is to determine availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide access to all housing in all areas while ensuring maximum value for money is achieved.  Analysis shows that increasing limits at this time will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to new recipients.<\/p><p>  I am aware that in the current market prospective tenants are finding it increasingly difficult to secure accommodation due to the reduced availability of properties particularly in areas of high demand.  Raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers, their families and students. I plan to keep this matter under close review.<\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met, including through the use of their discretionary statutory powers as necessary. A notice reminding staff of their discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated earlier this year.  The fact that approximately 3,750 people are in receipt of rent supplement in Kildare, of which over 750 were awarded this year, shows that a significant number of persons are being accommodated under the scheme in this region.<\/p><p>  In light of a particular concentration of the homelessness problem in the Dublin area, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. Since the launch of this initiative in mid-June 2014, almost 180 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.<\/p><p>  Increasing housing supply and the re-activation of the construction activity is a critical issue for Government and key to restoring stability to the rental market. As part of Budget 2015, Government has announced significant capital investment of over &euro;2.2 billion for social housing for the next three years.  In 2015, over &euro;800 million will be invested in a range of housing programmes which represents the first major investment in housing since 2009.<\/p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Alan Kelly TD, is also due to publish a Social Housing Strategy shortly which will provide a basis for an improved and sustainable approach to the provision of social housing supports in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400058#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Data","counter":224,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400058#WRE02400"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[41318\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400058#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide the figure for the number of community employment supervisors currently employed and the number of supervisors expected to retire in year 2015, 2016 and 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>As of 3<sup>rd<\/sup>November 2014, there are 1,350 supervisors employed by CE sponsoring organisations.<br\/><br\/>The number of supervisors estimated to reach State Pension retirement age in each of the following years, (based on the population as of 3<sup>rd<\/sup>November 2014) is:<br\/><br\/>- 2015 - 47<br\/><br\/>- 2016 - 52<br\/><br\/>- 2017 - 35<br\/><br\/>The Department does not provide funding to CE Sponsoring organisations for the employment of supervisors or CE participants who has reached state pension age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400058#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400058#WRE02700"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[41334\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400058#WRE02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of meetings she or officials from her Department had with a person (details supplied); the purpose of each of those meetings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":229,"content":"<p>I have not had any meetings with Mr. John Tierney, the managing director of Irish Water.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.

More than 1,700 posts from the Community Welfare Services of HSE and FAS were transferred to the Department. In parallel, I have radically overhauled labour-market activation policies and overseen the transformation of the Department from the passive benefits provider of old to a public employment service that is actively assisting people back to work, training or education. <br\/><br\/>Some of the significant reforms to the social welfare and labour market activation systems since I took up office in March 2011 are set out below.<br\/><br\/><b>From welfare to work: <\/b><br\/><br\/>- Major &ldquo;activation&rdquo; reforms have been introduced to help people back to work. <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>is the strategy driving these reforms. <br\/><br\/>- The centrepiece of <i>Pathways to Work<\/i>is Intreo (launched October 2012), the Department&rsquo;s employment service which is replacing old-style social welfare offices with Intreo offices.  These provide jobseekers with both income supports and employment services - like individually tailored personal progression plans and job-search assistance - in the one place.<br\/><br\/>- The number of DSP caseworkers on activation duties doubled due to internal deployment within the Department by the end of 2013.  In addition, JobPath, which is expected to commence in mid-2015, is a new programme of employment activation aimed specifically at the long-term unemployed (over 12 months) and those most distant from the labour market.<br\/><br\/>- A Record of Mutual Commitments is now signed by jobseekers, which outlines joint commitments - on the Department&rsquo;s behalf, to providing income support to jobseekers and in helping a jobseeker find work or progress back into the labour force;  and on the client&rsquo;s behalf, to engaging and working with officials from the Department along an agreed progression path.  Where a jobseeker refuses an appropriate offer of training, or other such intervention, legislation now provides for a reduction in payment levels.<br\/><br\/><b>Ensuring access to work and that work pays: <\/b><br\/><br\/>- Activation is just one element of the radically new approach to social welfare in Ireland, the purpose of which is to ensure that people are better off in work than on welfare.<br\/><br\/>- A new scheme called Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transition was introduced in July 2013 to assist Lone Parents back to work and towards financial independence. <br\/><br\/>- The Partial Capacity Benefit scheme was launched in February 2012 to allow people with disabilities avail of employment opportunities while still receiving income support from the Department.  <br\/><br\/>- The Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the roll-out of a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), to replace Rent Supplement. HAP will subsidise rent for people on welfare and in low-income employment so that they will not lose housing assistance when they move from welfare to work. The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support scheme.  HAP was introduced on a pilot basis in Limerick City and County Council in April 2014 and has since been recently extended to Waterford City and County Council, Cork County Council (15th Sept), and South Dublin County Council, Kilkenny County Council, Monaghan County Council and Louth County Council (1st Oct). <br\/><br\/>- Through the new Back to Work Family Dividend scheme announced in Budget 2015, long-term unemployed jobseekers with children who leave welfare to return to work can retain the child-related portion of their social welfare payment on a tapered basis over two years.  This includes those who move to self-employment, such as the construction sector.  It will also apply to One Parent Family Payment recipients who similarly go back into the workforce.  The scheme will be worth &euro;1,550 per child in the first year of employment or self-employment and half that amount again in the second year.<br\/><br\/><b>New schemes, more places:<\/b><br\/><br\/>- This year, the Department will spend more than &euro;1 billion on work, training and education places to benefit 85,000 people &ndash; and the number of such places has steadily increased. <br\/><br\/>- JobBridge, the national internship scheme, launched June 2011, has proved a major success. An independent evaluation of the scheme by Indecon Economic Consultants found JobBridge had a progression rate of 61% - meaning three in five participants secure employment after completing their internship. This is one of the best outcomes for such a scheme anywhere in Europe. Over 32,000 people have participated on JobBridge so far. <br\/><br\/>- The introduction of T&uacute;s, the community workplace initiative (2011) and Gateway, the local authority workplace initiative (2013), has provided opportunities for jobseekers to maintain their work readiness and harness new skills.<br\/><br\/>- Following a review of community employment and other employment support measures funded by the Department, revisions were made to community employment, the Back to Education programme and a number of other training support measures to offer greater access and flexibility to ensure more focused use of resources on the needs of jobseekers.<br\/><br\/>- In addition to the overall Pathways to Work reforms, further changes are being made to how the Departments engages specifically with the young unemployed under the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan published earlier this year. In particular, all of the young unemployed will be engaged with immediately on becoming unemployed, regardless of their profiled probability of re-employment. Re-employment subsidies will also be available for young people at an earlier stage in terms of duration of unemployment, and a specific variant of JobBridge is being launched for particularly disadvantaged young people.<br\/><br\/><b>Working with employers:<\/b><br\/><br\/>- The Department now has a dedicated Employer Relations Division, which works with employers to assist them with their recruitment needs and find employees from the Live Register. <br\/><br\/>- The Department works hand-in-hand with State agencies such as the IDA to attract overseas investment to Ireland by demonstrating to international companies that their recruitment needs can be met in Ireland.  This is done through &ldquo;job-matching&rdquo; profiles &ndash; matching potential positions with appropriate candidates. <br\/><br\/>- JobsPlus is the new employer incentive scheme, launched July 2013, which provides cash grants to businesses which hire persons who have been long-term unemployed. Under the scheme, the State covers approximately &euro;1 in &euro;4 of the typical cost of hiring someone who has been on the Live Register for 12 months or more.  Budget 2015 provided for an additional 3,000 employees to be supported by this scheme.<br\/><br\/><b>Combatting welfare fraud<\/b><b>: <\/b><br\/><br\/>- The Programme for Government commits to maintaining core welfare rates while taking a zero-tolerance approach towards welfare fraud.<br\/><br\/>-The Department&rsquo;s Fraud Initiative 2011-2013 significantly strengthened what is known as &ldquo;control activity&rdquo; &ndash; i.e. rooting out fraud and eliminating overpayments.  In 2013, more than 1 million reviews of individual social welfare claims were carried out, and savings of &euro;632 million were achieved through control activity. <br\/><br\/>- Departmental officials have been given a range of additional powers to combat fraud.  Social welfare inspectors now have the powers (introduced in June 2012) to question people at ports and airports whom they believe may be entering the country to claim social welfare payments fraudulently.<br\/><br\/>- Legislation was introduced in December 2012 to increase the amount that the Department can recover from an individual&rsquo;s personal weekly payment in cases of overpayment. The Department can now recover up to 15% of a person&rsquo;s payment whereas previously it had been as little as &euro;2 a week. <br\/><br\/>- To further enhance the powers to recover overpayments, the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 introduced additional powers for the recovery of social welfare overpayments by way of notice of attachment to earnings and\/or money held by an overpaid person in a financial institution. The 2014 Act now includes a provision to extend Notice of Attachment to other state payments.<br\/><br\/>- Data exchange with Revenue has been considerably enhanced allowing for focused control activity &ndash; particularly in relation to customers who receive means-tested welfare payments but may not have declared all their means to the Department.<br\/><br\/>- The Public Service Card, which involves face-to-face registration and the capture of biometric data to prevent identity abuse, has moved into full production, with well over a million cards issued to date.  It is now an integral part of claim processing and control activity.  To further strengthen the Public Services Card registration process, the Department acquired facial imaging matching software to help detect and deter duplicate registrations.<br\/><br\/>- In April of this year the Department published a new <i>Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018<\/i>.  The new strategy builds on the approach and progress made under the previous Initiative.  In terms of new measures being progressed under the Strategy 2014-2018 the Department will: <br\/><br\/>- Utilise predictive analytical techniques to enhance the methods currently in place to identify claims that are more likely to be fraudulent. <br\/><br\/>- Enhance debt recovery through a new debt management system which will &lsquo;go live&rsquo; by the end of 2014.<br\/><br\/>- Have a greater presence on the ground through the secondment of 20 Garda&iacute; to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit.<br\/><br\/><b>Sustainability of Pensions<\/b><br\/><br\/>- A broad range of legislative and regulatory reforms been made over a number of years to improve the sustainability of defined benefit pension schemes and protect members&rsquo; benefits into the future.<br\/><br\/>- In Quarter 1 2014, the governance of the Pensions Board (17 paid members) was restructured to consist of a three-person Pensions Authority to provide operational oversight of pensions regulation and a separate unpaid Pensions Council, with a majority of members which will represent consumer interests and advise the Minister on pensions policy.  <br\/><br\/>- A Steering Group has been established with regards to merger of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman with the Financial Services Ombudsman, as recommended in the Critical Review.  The timeline for implementation has yet to be fully finalised but it is hoped to complete the merger by mid-2015.<br\/><br\/>- The decision to reform the State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. There are currently 5.3 people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately 2.1 to 1 by 2060.  This has significant associated pension costs for the State. <br\/><br\/>- The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years. This began in January 2014 with the standardisation of pension age for all at 66 years.  From April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State Pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions. From September 2012, new rate bands for State Pension were introduced, which more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person.<br\/><br\/>- In line with the Programme for Government, the recent 2014-2016 Statement of Priorities confirmed that during 2015 the Government will agree a roadmap and timeline for the introduction of a new, universal supplementary pension saving scheme.<br\/><br\/><b>Reforming Existing Schemes:<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>One-Parent Family Payment<\/b><br\/><br\/>- The Department is currently undertaking comprehensive reform of the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP). These reforms are designed to tackle long term welfare dependency and the high rates of lone parents who are at risk of consistent poverty. The reforms see a reduction in the age threshold of the youngest child at which a lone parent is still eligible for the OFP. The age is being reduced to seven years of age on a phased basis to 7 years by 2015<br\/><br\/><b>Free Travel variant of the Public Services Card (PSC)<\/b><br\/><br\/>- The introduction of the new free travel variant of the PSC in December 2013 will help eliminate the fraudulent use of the Free Travel Pass. The new card includes customer photo identification and a number of additional security features.  Over 270,000 free travel variants have been issued to date.<br\/><br\/><b>Water Support<\/b><br\/><br\/>- The introduction from 2015 of &ldquo;water support&rdquo;, a new payment of &euro;100 per annum, paid on a quarterly basis (&euro;25) to all those in receipt of either the household benefits package or the fuel allowance, will help compensate for the costs of water services.<br\/><br\/><b>School Meals<\/b><br\/><br\/>- Budgets 2014 and 2015 provided for an additional &euro;2 million in funding each year for the School Meals scheme (bringing total funding to &euro;39 million for 2015).  The extra funding in 2014 was made available for school meals for all DEIS schools who were not participating in the scheme.  The 2015 additional funding is primarily for the provision of breakfast clubs to support school going children in disadvantaged areas, and where possible, to increase funding for existing DEIS school as a consequence of increased pupil numbers.<br\/><br\/><b>The Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare<\/b><br\/><br\/>- I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in 2011. This group harnesses expert opinion and experience to address specific issues around the interaction of the tax and social protection systems, and make cost effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes. Three reports have been completed and published:<br\/><br\/>- Child and Family Income Supplement payments (February 2013)<br\/><br\/>- Disability Allowance budget changes (April 2013)<br\/><br\/>- PRSI for self-employed (September 2013)<br\/><br\/>- The Advisory Group submitted its final report, on working age payments, in August 2014.

This objective is to be achieved over time by enhancing and prioritising the Intreo engagement with newly unemployed young people, and by maintaining and developing the current range of education, training and employment interventions for young people.<br\/><br\/>The rollout of the Youth Guarantee will be based on the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan, which was published in January 2014. Implementation of the Youth Guarantee began in 2014.  Starting in 2014, and for completion by the end of 2015, processes and programmes are being progressively rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the Public Employment Services) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months.<br\/><br\/>While the resources under the Youth Guarantee are targeted more towards those with the highest risk of becoming long-term unemployed, all young people signing on enter the engagement process (via Group Engagement sessions) within the first two weeks of signing on. Effectively, therefore, all persons under the age of 25 who become unemployed and join the Live Register represent the target group at whom policies developed under the Guarantee are aimed.<br\/><br\/>The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan provides for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014.  This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the 28,000 plus places for unemployed young people, approximately 14,500 of these had been taken up at the end of September.  The table supplied below displays both the total estimate for the full-year intake and costs provided in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan as well as the most recent year-to-date intake figures. The estimated full-year cost of the measures included in the table is &euro;336 million.<br\/><br\/>Take-up is expected to rise substantially by year-end, for several reasons. <br\/><br\/>First, the student intake on programmes such as the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme (VTOS) is concentrated in September\/October in line with the academic calendar.  In addition, the intake of young people to the 2014 iteration of the Momentum programme for long-term unemployed jobseekers has just begun (late September).<br\/><br\/>Second, some of the initiatives planned under the guarantee required primary legislation to allow positive discrimination on age grounds in the provision of employment services and supports.  This legislation was enacted as part of the Social Welfare Bill over the summer.<br\/><br\/>Two employment schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people (supporting young unemployed at risk of becoming long-term unemployed who have been signing on the Live Register for 4 months), were dependent on this legislation being passed.  These schemes will be in place shortly.  The legislation also permits the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed which should also translate increased placement on schemes covered by the Youth Guarantee; processes to give effect to this engagement are currently being implemented by the Department.<br\/><br\/>Estimates for the projected 2015 inflow and associated costs will be at the same level as those planned for 2014.<br\/><br\/>The Ballymun Youth Guarantee Pilot is being mainly funded by the European Commission. Such specific funding for other pilot programmes is not available. Moreover, it is unlikely that the Department will operate a specific scheme for each of its 60+ local offices. However there will be flexibility to tailor the implementation to local conditions (for example with regard to the cohorts of young people to be selected for engagement in the first instance etc.) and the specific approach to be followed in each area, be it rural or urban, will be a matter for local DSP management in consultation with relevant stakeholders. It is intended that the approach in other areas will however benefit from the lessons learned during the Ballymun pilot.

State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  This policy is to make the pension system sustainable, in the context of ever increasing life expectancy.<\/p><p>  The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age. <\/p><p>  All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. Persons aged between 65 and 66 years who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years). In the case of a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the job seekers entitlement relating to the second benefit year. A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseekers assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of job seekers benefit within the past year. <\/p><p>  I was happy to be able to introduce new arrangements in Budget 2014 for older jobseekers, i.e., those aged 62 and over who have left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. With effect from 1 January 2014, fully unemployed jobseekers aged 62 or over will be placed on yearly signing and will be given the option of transferring to EFT payments. Furthermore, they will not be subject to mandatory activation measures or activation-related sanctions but may avail of employment support. <\/p><p>  There is no statutory compulsory retirement age for employees in Ireland. Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer\/employee relationship and the contract of employment. <\/p><p>  Social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400060#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":333,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400061#WRH00250"},{"type":"question","counter":334,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[41943\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400061#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the rules in place that will apply to a person who was born in 1965 in relation to eligibility for the State pension (contributory) in terms of the age they will be eligible for the pension and the method by which their entitlement will be calculated; if averaging will apply as at present or the total number of contributions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028 <\/p><p>  Currently in order to qualify for the State pension (contributory), a person must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions which include:<\/p><p>  - have entered insurance before the age of 66, <\/p><p>  - have at least 520 paid contributions, and <\/p><p>  - satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid and\/or credited is required for a full rate pension). <\/p><p>  Qualification for a pension is calculated on an averaging system based on the PRSI contributions paid over a working life.  The individual&rsquo;s yearly average number of contributions determines the amount of pension paid.  This is generally calculated from the date on which paid employment commenced to pension age, therefore it varies depending on each individual&rsquo;s working life.  <\/p><p>  The average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The system was designed with a view to ensuring that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately in that year rather than waiting for contributions to build up, and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was limited and people could move in and out of coverage as a result of the nature of their employment and\/or their earnings.

Using the at-risk-of-poverty measure, 18.8 per cent of children were in poverty in 2012, as compared with 20.8 per cent in the years preceding the crisis. <br\/><br\/>Compared with EU member states, Ireland was ranked 12th of 28th in 2012, an improvement of two places on 2008. <br\/><br\/>The Government has already adopted a key recommendation of the UNICEF report - to make an explicit commitment to end child poverty - by setting a child poverty sub-target in April 2014, which is to lift 70,000 children out of poverty by 2020. <br\/><br\/>The Department of Social Protection helps to prevent child poverty by providing income support for families through child benefit, qualified child increases for welfare recipients, family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, amounting to &euro;2.3 billion in 2014.  Through these and other social transfers, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children is reduced from 45 per cent to 18.8 per cent, a poverty reduction effect of 59 per cent. <br\/><br\/>Ireland is amongst the best performing member states in the EU in this regard.

The strategy outlined in Pathways to Work is devised to ensure new job opportunities are made available to people on the live register and that jobseekers are prepared to avail of work opportunities.  Since the introduction of Pathways to Work, a significant transformation has already been delivered in the way the Department of Social Protection works with jobseekers and in its engagement with employers.  This has resulted in the revision of a range of services and schemes including the provision of new incentives for both jobseekers and employers. <\/p><p>  The Department operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support jobseekers to return to and remain at work, establish self-employment opportunities and engage in reskilling and up-skilling.  For jobseekers with families, including lone parents, entering work, financial supports are provided in the form of Family Income Supplement (FIS), to supplement income from work where this is low.  Allied to this, an important new measure was announced in Budget 2015, called the Back to Work Family Dividend, which will help jobseekers and lone parents with children return to work by allowing them to retain an element of the welfare payment previously paid in respect of dependent children.  The Part-Time Job Incentive Scheme is also available which allows jobseekers to take up part-time employment for less than 24 hours per week and to continue to receive a weekly income supplement. <\/p><p>  In terms of incentives for employers, JobsPlus is a targeted financial employment subsidy designed to encourage companies to focus their recruitment activities on the long-term unemployed.  At the end of September 2014, approximately 3,000 long-term jobseekers were being supported in work through the JobsPlus scheme.

In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision, and also in 2014.  As at 30 September 2014, the average time taken to process an appeal requiring an oral hearing was 29.3 weeks and for a summary decision was 21.8 weeks.<br\/><br\/>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting any clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  While this process carries an inherent delay in terms of finalising an appeal, it also crystalizes the flexibility and accessibility of the appeals system.  By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial function, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.<br\/><br\/>There has been a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2009 which has placed extraordinary pressure on the office.  Up to 2009, the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum whereas in 2012, the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013. In order to manage this increasing workload, significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving appeals processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number of serving Appeals Officers to 41; reviewing and improving business processes; and implementing a new operating model within the appeals office.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant increase in the annual number of appeals finalised in the appeals office from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress has also been made in reducing the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 10,173 at 31<sup>st<\/sup>October 2014.<br\/><br\/>The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.<br\/><br\/><b>2012 - Appeals Processing times by scheme 1\/1\/2012 - 31\/12\/2012 - Summary and Oral<\/b><table><tr><th>Benefits\/Allowances<\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Summary Decisions<\/th><th>Average processing times (weeks)<br \/><br \/>Oral Hearings<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit<\/td><td>27.7<\/td><td>40.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Blind Pension<\/td><td>24.4<\/td><td>34.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance<\/td><td>33.5<\/td><td>42.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit<\/td><td>27.3<\/td><td>35.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Child Benefit<\/td><td>47.1<\/td><td>53.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance<\/td><td>34.2<\/td><td>40.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td>41.9<\/td><td>50.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care<\/td><td>32.5<\/td><td>41.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit<\/td><td>27.6<\/td><td>45.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Allowance<\/td><td>24.5<\/td><td>39.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farm Assist<\/td><td>23.4<\/td><td>44.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant<\/td><td>29.0<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement<\/td><td>22.8<\/td><td>31.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension<\/td><td>38.8<\/td><td>48.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives<\/td><td>33.9<\/td><td>69.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment<\/td><td>29.4<\/td><td>44.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit<\/td><td>30.8<\/td><td>41.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td>33.2<\/td><td>59.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Cont)<\/td><td>27.7<\/td><td>51.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)<\/td><td>25.1<\/td><td>49.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit<\/td><td>19.5<\/td><td>66.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit (Medical)<\/td><td>78.7<\/td><td>87.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension<\/td><td>35.7<\/td><td>46.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement<\/td><td>14.2<\/td><td>48.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)<\/td><td>25.8<\/td><td>49.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-con)<\/td><td>32.0<\/td><td>58.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pre-Retirement Allowance<\/td><td>54.6<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)<\/td><td>22.8<\/td><td>38.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance<\/td><td>24.4<\/td><td>34.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit<\/td><td>20.9<\/td><td>30.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant<\/td><td>28.5<\/td><td>37.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment<\/td><td>45.6<\/td><td>83.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare  Allowance<\/td><td>17.6<\/td><td>22.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefits<\/td><td>19.0<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)<\/td><td>27.1<\/td><td>60.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-con)<\/td><td>30.9<\/td><td>39.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Widows Parent Grant<\/td><td>23.2<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>All Appeals<\/td><td>27.8<\/td><td>39.5<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><b>2013 - Appeals processing times by scheme 01\/01\/2013 &ndash;

In such cases an Appeals Officer decision was not necessary. <br\/><br\/><b>Appeal Receipts  and Outcomes 2013 &ndash; 2014 (to 30\/9\/2014)<\/b><table><tr><th>Benefits\/Allowances<\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th>Appeals Decided by Appeals Officers<\/th><th>Appeals Decided by Appeals Officers<\/th><th>Appeals Decided by Appeals Officers<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>Annual Receipts<\/td><td>Revised Decisions by Deciding Officers<\/td><td>Allowed<\/td><td>Partially Allowed<\/td><td>Disallowed<\/td><td>Withdrawn<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2013<\/td><td><div>6,836<\/div><\/td><td><div>792<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,882<\/div><\/td><td><div>84<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,842<\/div><\/td><td><div>145<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td><div>4,223<\/div><\/td><td><div>392<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,280<\/div><\/td><td><div>77<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,710<\/div><\/td><td><div>67<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2013<\/td><td><div>1,761<\/div><\/td><td><div>928<\/div><\/td><td><div>303<\/div><\/td><td><div>13<\/div><\/td><td><div>554<\/div><\/td><td><div>740<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td><div>1,010<\/div><\/td><td><div>518<\/div><\/td><td><div>170<\/div><\/td><td><div>17<\/div><\/td><td><div>262<\/div><\/td><td><div>303<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2013<\/td><td><div>4,501<\/div><\/td><td><div>2,243<\/div><\/td><td><div>3,336<\/div><\/td><td><div>18<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,311<\/div><\/td><td><div>60<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td><div>2,127<\/div><\/td><td><div>497<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,865<\/div><\/td><td><div>11<\/div><\/td><td><div>660<\/div><\/td><td><div>34<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2013<\/td><td><div>3,869<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,040<\/div><\/td><td><div>990<\/div><\/td><td><div>131<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,505<\/div><\/td><td><div>56<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td><div>2,030<\/div><\/td><td><div>396<\/div><\/td><td><div>928<\/div><\/td><td><div>148<\/div><\/td><td><div>1,163<\/div><\/td><td><div>36<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2013<\/td><td><div>115<\/div><\/td><td><div>43<\/div><\/td><td><div>44<\/div><\/td><td><div>2<\/div><\/td><td><div>53<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Carer&rsquo;s Benefit<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td><div>99<\/div><\/td><td><div>36<\/div><\/td><td><div>30<\/div><\/td><td><div>3<\/div><\/td><td><div>36<\/div><\/td><td><div>4<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>2013<\/td><td><div>1,688<\/div><\/td><td><div>533<\/div><\/td><td><div>783<\/div><\/td><td><div>25<\/div><\/td><td><div>694<\/div><\/td><td><div>30<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Domicilliary Care Allowance<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td><div>932<\/div><\/td><td><div>421<\/div><\/td><td><div>573<\/div><\/td><td><div>15<\/div><\/td><td><div>257<\/div><\/td><td><div>7<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400061#WRH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Non-Contributory) Numbers","counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400061#WRH05350"},{"type":"question","counter":386,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[42163\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400061#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the total number of recipients of non-contributory old age pension; the degree to which this number has fluctuated in the past six years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":387,"content":"<p>The number of recipients of State pension non-contributory (SPNC) is contained in the Department&rsquo;s Annual Statistical Information Report which is published on the Department&rsquo;s website on the following link:. <br\/><br\/>Section B of the report contains statistical information in relation to pensions and Table B3 outlines the information requested by the Deputy from 2004 - \u00ad2013.<br\/><br\/>In 2007 there were 97,726 in receipt of SPNC.

Its purpose is to provide Philanthropy Ireland and its members with insights on possible area of need that might inform their future funding programmes. It is based on desk research and interviews with 14 informants.  The report highlights the reduction in social need funding due to the withdrawal of a number of philanthropic foundations from Ireland, as well as reduced state funding for community and voluntary bodies under various social programmes. <br\/><br\/>The Department of Social Protection is the main provider of funding for social need in Ireland.  In 2014, it will spend &euro;19.6 billion on income support schemes for 1,426,000 recipients and 2,197,000 beneficiaries, including children, the unemployed, lone parents, people with a disability, and older people.  This expenditure has increased by &euro;1.8 billion on the 2008 figure, an increase of 10 per cent, despite the requirements for fiscal consolidation measures under the Troika programme.  In Budget 2015, there is provision for additional expenditure on social protection programmes of &euro;198 million, plus a further &euro;65.5 million on a Christmas Bonus for recipients of long-term welfare schemes. <br\/><br\/>The Department of Social Protection is not a funder of social programmes delivered by the community and voluntary sector and therefore has not reduced its funding for this sector.  The Department engages with a range of community and voluntary groups on the delivery of its services and consults with these groups on budgetary policy through its annual pre-Budget forum.  The Department greatly values the contribution of these organisations to its work. <br\/><br\/>The latest CSO statistics show that in 2012 7.7 per cent of the population was in consistent poverty.  The national social target for poverty reduction is to reduce this figure to 4 per cent by 2016 and to 2 per cent or less by 2020.  Community and voluntary groups have a vital role to play in helping to achieve this national target. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400061#WRH05800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":391,"content":"<p>Question No. 250 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Applications","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[42236\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the basis on which her Department may request private bank statements from persons on jobseeker's allowance; the data protection measures that are in place to protect such sensitive information; if she will indicate what happens to the information after it has been used for claim assessment purposes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>Jobseekers allowance is a means-tested payment and is payable subject to a number of conditions.

NPRF Commitment &euro;125 million)<\/b><br\/><br\/>Since the inception of the fund, Carlyle Cardinal has developed strong networks across Ireland and has generated a strong pipeline of attractive opportunities for the fund. The Carlyle Cardinal Ireland fund completed its final closing in June 2014 at &euro;292 million, just short of its &euro;300 million target.  In January 2014, Carlyle Cardinal announced that it had completed its first transaction with a significant investment in Lily O'Brien's, the Irish manufacturer of premium chocolates, and it has recently closed its second investment in GSLS, a cash-in-transit company.<br\/><br\/><b>SME Credit Fund - Bluebay<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>(&euro;450 million credit fund focused on lending to large SME and Mid Cap companies. NPRF Commitment &euro;200 million)<\/b><br\/><br\/>The SME Credit Fund considers credit provision through acquiring and refinancing loans close to maturity where existing lenders are not willing to provide new lines of credit.  Lending by the fund is at competitive market rates with loan sizes ranging from &euro;5 million to &euro;45 million with a projected average size of &euro;15 million.  To date six loans have been completed totalling approximately &euro;120 million.  The pipeline remains strong as BlueBay considers opportunities across a number of industry sectors and currently is actively working through diligence and documentation on a further 3 transactions.<br\/><br\/><b>SME Turnaround Fund - Better Capital Ireland\u00a0 (&quot;BCI&quot;)<\/b><br\/><br\/><b>(&euro;100 million fund focused on deep turnaround investing in troubled companies. NPRF Commitment &euro;50 million)<\/b><br\/><br\/>The NTMA and Better Capital have agreed not to extend the investment period of this fund which expires at the end of December 2014; however, the two parties will continue to collaborate in respect of turnaround investment opportunities in Ireland post-December 2014.  The fund had been set up with a lifespan of two years, with the intention of investing in distressed firms but positive changes in the economy meant it has not completed any investments.<br\/><br\/>In response to some of specific information sought in this Parliamentary Question the NTMA have advised that they are developing their capabilities for collating and analyzing data to measure and report on economic impact on an ex-post basis (i.e. after the investment has been made).  This will require a completely new data set to be sought and reported on by funds and the underlying companies in which funds have invested and by companies or project sponsors in which the Fund has invested directly.  While it is standard practice that companies report financial information to their investors, the new ISIF mandate will also require metrics that can be used to help assess economic impact to be reported.  Once approved by the incoming NTMA Board, a preliminary assessment of the economic impact of the investments made to date in Ireland will be published.<br\/><br\/><b>Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI)<\/b><br\/><br\/>As you are no doubt aware the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has been established by the Government as another initiative to ensure that SMEs in Ireland are provided with sufficient finance for growth.\u00a0 Loan agreements with the international funders, KfW and the European Investment Bank, to the value of &euro;550m have been signed to fund the SBCI during its initial period of operations.\u00a0 The SBCI is funded to the value of &euro;800m of which &euro;150m is from KfW, &euro;400m from the European Investment Bank and &euro;250m from the National Pension Reserve Fund.  A key benefit of the\u00a0SBCI will be its\u00a0ability to facilitate loans with initial capital repayment breaks or the\u00a0offering of loans with\u00a0longer durations than are typically available currently.\u00a0 In such cases, SMEs would have greater capacity to make investments on the basis of improved cash flow matching, which makes growth more likely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":414,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ02700"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[41436\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of businesses that have made use of the small and medium enterprise online tool designed to assist the SME sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":416,"content":"<p>The Government recognises that small businesses play a central role in\u00a0the sustainable recovery of the Irish economy.

On answering 8 simple questions, the small business will receive a list of available government supports.  A significant advantage of the Online Tool is its ease of use and the co-ordinated results which cover a broad range of government departments and agencies, with updates and new supports added regularly.<br\/><br\/>In the first four months since its launch, the Supporting SMEs Online Tool had 17,000 unique visitors, an average of 135 a day and over 4,300 a month.  The Supporting SMEs campaign team continues to work to increase awareness of the Online Tool.<br\/><br\/>To engage with SMEs and raise awareness of the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, members of the Supporting SMEs campaign team attend appropriate regional events throughout the year, including the National Ploughing Championships, National Womens' Enterprise Day, and the ISME National Conference.\u00a0 Alongside this, an online advertising campaign to direct traffic to the Online Tool commenced in late September, and saw an increase in users of the Online Tool.  The next phase of the campaign will involve the dissemination of information material to all key stakeholders to increase their awareness of the Supporting SMEs Online Tool. <br\/><br\/>The Supporting SMEs campaign team meets on a monthly basis to evaluate the impact of the campaign to date and to plan the most appropriate strategy to raise awareness of government supports available to SMEs, including their awareness of and engagement with the Supporting SMEs Online Tool.<br\/><br\/>The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ03000"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[41721\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to change the single person child carer tax credit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":419,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the One-Parent Family Tax Credit was replaced with the Single Person Child Carer Credit from 1 January 2014.The new credit is more targeted in that it is, in the first instance, only available to the primary carer of the child.<br\/><br\/>As part of the normal budgetary preparations all tax reliefs, credits and incentives are reviewed in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them. <br\/><br\/>I am satisfied that the tax credit in its current form is working as intended and I have no plans to change it at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[41726\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason an additional transaction fee of 1.49% is allowed to be charged on credit card payments of local property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the charge to which the Deputy refers has been reduced to 1.1% with effect from 1 October 2014.<\/p><p>  The charge, which is applicable to all credit card tax payments to Revenue including Local Property Tax (LPT) and arrears of Household Charge (HHC), is passed to the taxpayer as provided for by Section 960EA (inserted by Section 79 of the Finance Act 2011 (No. 6 of 2011) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.

Petrol stretching involves the illegal addition of a low tax commodity to petrol to defraud motorists and the State.<\/p><p>  Revenue investigates all complaints of this kind and fuel samples are taken from filling stations and referred to the State Laboratory for analysis where the investigating officers have reason to suspect excise fraud. To date 48 premises nationwide have been tested with samples referred to the State Laboratory.<\/p><p>  Conclusive results have been received in one case which confirms contamination through the presence of kerosene and Revenue are considering the possibility of prosecution in this case.  Final results are awaited in respect of the other samples referred for analysis.  It is understood the State Laboratory is reviewing its existing procedures with a view to expediting testing which, I am informed is quite complex.<\/p><p>  The Deputy can be assured that, if Revenue's investigations and the analysis of fuel samples indicate the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<\/p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102 (1A) of the Finance Act 1999.  It carries a penalty on summary conviction of a fine of &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment.  Where conviction occurs on indictment, a fine of up to &euro;126,970, or a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both a fine or imprisonment, may be imposed.  The fine that may be imposed where a conviction occurs on indictment was increased substantially by the Finance Act 2010.  I have no immediate plans to increase penalties, but I will keep the matter under review.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  I understand also that Revenue has been in contact with the motor and fuel trades about the reported problems.  Cooperation with the fuel trade has been an important element in the successful work undertaken in recent years to combat fuel fraud, and can play a key role in addressing any further issues that come to light. It is essential, in particular, that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific traders are shifting some of their sourcing to illegal fuel.<\/p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol, and should report any suspicions to Revenue.  Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically dealing with the shadow economy and this includes a reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices including the adulteration of fuel.<\/p><p>  An extensive range of new measure has been introduced over recent years to tackle fuel fraud, including enhanced supply chain controls and the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker.  Key measures include the following:<\/p><p>  -\tThe licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;<\/p><p>  -\tA new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;<\/p><p>  -\tNew requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis;<\/p><p>  -\tNew supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013 following significant investment in new IT systems.  These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary, and<\/p><p>  -\tAn intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.<\/p><p>  In addition to the measures implemented to date, Revenue has, in partnership with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK identified a more effective fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015 following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.<\/p><p>  To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax.  This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity. Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions. <\/p><p>  I am committed to providing new measures to further assist Revenue in its work against fuel fraud should they be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise Duties","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[42271\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding duty paid within the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that in accordance with Council Directive 2008\/118\/EC and section 104(2) of the Finance Act 2001, tobacco products tax is not chargeable on tobacco products that are bought tax-paid by a private individual in another Member State of the European Union for personal consumption by that person in this State.

In addition, Revenue is committed to ensuring that the delivery of their customer service is as cost effective as possible for the Exchequer, having regard to the resources available and the need to balance the deployment of resources between service provision and the further key corporate priority of tackling non-compliance with tax and duty obligations.<br\/><br\/>In recent years, despite budgetary and resource constraints, Revenue has improved the delivery of customer services.  In particular, Revenue's PAYE Anytime service is used by thousands of customers to conduct their business with Revenue.  Revenue's On-Line Service (ROS) provides a similarly efficient service for business tax customers.<br\/><br\/>These on-line services (available at .) are designed to provide customers with quick, convenient and cost-effective ways of conducting business with Revenue.<br\/><br\/>Revenue is also fully committed to providing a quality service to those customers whose preference is to deal with them in person, for example:<br\/><br\/>-a regionalised lo-call telephone service is available for PAYE taxpayers. The Dublin Region contact number is 1890 333 425, and the contact numbers for the other Regions are available on www.revenue.ie. There are also phone helplines for business taxpayers and the respective contact details are communicated directly to those taxpayers, and are also easily accessible on .<br\/><br\/>-a correspondence service, with contact addresses for the respective Tax Districts also on www.revenue.ie.<br\/><br\/>-in the Dublin area, the Central Revenue Information Office (CRIO) has state-of-the-art facilities for dealing with customers who wish to carry out transactions face to face with a Revenue staff member.<br\/><br\/>The CRIO is located at O'Connell St.\/Cathedral St., Dublin 1, and is open from 8.30am to 4.00pm, Monday to Friday. The CRIO is convenient to all of the main public transport routes into Dublin city, and it has the capacity to deal with the current demand level for &quot;walk-in&quot; counter services by Revenue customers in the greater Dublin area.<br\/><br\/>As with any modern service provider, the Deputy will appreciate that good business practice requires Revenue to constantly review service delivery to ensure that they have the correct balance across the channels to suit demand levels and changing customer preferences.  Accordingly, the opening hours of public offices and telephone services are subject to ongoing review in order to most effectively meet peaks and troughs of customer demand levels.<br\/><br\/>The vast majority of customers in Revenue's public offices have relatively straightforward informational enquiries, or wish to carry out routine transactions such as claiming tax credits or refunds.  These transactions can be carried out much more effectively on-line or by telephone.  With this increasing uptake in on-line and telephone transactions, the demand level in the Tallaght Revenue Information Office (TRIO) has been steadily declining, with a reduction of some 50% in the number of customers in recent years.<br\/><br\/>The opening hours of the office have accordingly been adjusted in tandem with the reduced demand and in that context the office closed on 5 August last.<br\/><br\/>In the lead-up to the closure, every effort was made to ensure that there would be no reduction in the quality of service to customers:<br\/><br\/>-Public notices were placed in TRIO to ensure customer awareness and to highlight the service alternatives;<br\/><br\/>-The TRIO staff liaised with the Tallaght Citizens Information Office and supplied that office with the most popular tax forms and leaflets;<br\/><br\/>-TRIO staff also pro-actively liaised with other local agencies and large local employers to advise them about the August closure and alternatives services to meet their needs.<br\/><br\/>Revenue is confident that customers in Tallaght will continue to receive the same high levels of customer service and the Dublin South County Tax District has been closely monitoring contacts from their customers.<br\/><br\/>In that context, it should be noted that with a view to managing a peak customer demand in the run up to the pay and file deadline for self assessed taxpayers, and the local property tax pay and file campaign, \u00a0TRIO reopened on 15 October last to provide a morning only service from Wednesday to Friday, 9.30am to 1pm.  The ongoing provision of the TRIO service will kept under continuous review, having regard to demand for the service, seasonal or otherwise, the availability of resources and the need to balance the deployment of resources across the range of customer service and compliance functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ06200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Restructuring","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ06300"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[40989\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400062#WRJ06400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a State supported bank is planning to outsource a number of functions (details supplied); the number of employees who will be affected; the plans the bank has for the future provision of those services; the way the terms and conditions of those employees will be protected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware under the Relationship Frameworks the State does not intervene in the day to day operations of the banks or their management decisions regarding commercial matters.   <\/p><p>  In the case of\u00a0AIB, the bank\u00a0has previously indicated that as part of its restructuring plan to reduce costs and increase efficiencies, outsourcing of certain functions would be considered in consultation with unions and affected staff.

While this is due largely to the lack of activity in the property market over much of this time, there is considerable doubt that the provisions would operate in an effective way on the ground or could be amended to operate effectively.<b><\/b>More significantly, however, the views which I have seen expressed by various parties in both the private and public sector with an interest in the proper development of the housing market, and with which I agree,\u00a0are that the windfall tax provisions are acting and will act as an impediment to land rezoning, land development and redevelopment and to land sales for development. <br\/><br\/>The abolition of the windfall tax provisions should be seen in the context of other decisions and proposals announced recently, including those by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, which are focused on encouraging increased activity in the residential construction sector to meet increasing demand for housing.  I indicated in my Budget speech, however, that while the Government is doing its part to remove impediments to a fully functioning property market, there will be no return to the past where tax incentives for developers drove supply.  I also announced in the Budget that there will be a consultation in the coming months on taxation measures that might be introduced to address the issue of land owners who do not develop zoned and serviced land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400063#WRK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Charge Administration","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400063#WRK00850"},{"type":"question","counter":474,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[41211\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400063#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 210 of 13 May 2014 and the acknowledgement therein that the Revenue Commissioners recognise that the person in question acted in good faith based on the information they received, and further to several phone-calls to the Revenue Commissioners from this Deputy's office in relation to this case, if he will outline if the arrears that were attributed to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 have now been cancelled.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":475,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that it fully accepts that the person in question did not pay his original Household Charge (HHC) liability on foot of information that he received from the Local Government Management Agency in respect of his obligations.<\/p><p>  On that basis, as outlined by me in Question 21424\/14, Revenue agreed that the person would only pay the original &euro;100 charge rather than the higher &euro;200 'late' charge as provided for in Section 156 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended).<\/p><p>  Revenue also accepts that the person paid the &euro;100 liability immediately on receipt of confirmation that the lower amount was acceptable given the circumstances of the case.

Revenue has made action against this illegal activity one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action. <\/p><p>  Revenue's strategy includes the following elements:<\/p><p>  -\tThe licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of the fuel criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market;<\/p><p>  -\tA new licensing regime was introduced for marked fuel traders in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering;<\/p><p>  -\tNew requirements in relation to fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis;<\/p><p>  -\tFollowing a significant investment in the required IT systems, new supply chain controls were introduced from January 2013. These controls require all licensed fuel traders, whether dealing in road fuel or marked fuel, to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.\u00a0 Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution that will support follow-up enforcement action where necessary, and<\/p><p>-\tAn intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.<\/p><p>  In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK completed an Invitation to Make Submissions process to identify a more effective fuel marker and it is expected that a new marker will be introduced in both jurisdictions early in 2015, following consultation with the oil industry and other stakeholders.  To support further the integrity of the distribution system and minimise the risk of fraud, I introduced a provision in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that will make a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty at the standard rate of tax.  This new provision will strengthen Revenue's hand in dealing with those traders supplying rebated fuel recklessly to dubious customers and will provide a further disincentive to such activity.  Revenue has published guidelines for mineral oil traders which will assist them in identifying and avoiding such transactions.  Revenue works closely with fuel sector representative bodies in tackling the problem and these bodies have been very supportive of the measures introduced to combat fuel laundering.\u00a0 Revenue chairs the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group to facilitate traders reporting suspicious matters through their representative associations on a confidential basis.\u00a0 This information can assist Revenue in closing down the illicit trade by identifying traders supplying fuel to launderers and by identifying outlets that are selling laundered diesel.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  In addition, Revenue works in close cooperation with other enforcement authorities, in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, in combating this all-island problem. The Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group, which includes representatives of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other relevant organisations, was established to facilitate this cooperation, and has proven effective in supporting the identification and targeting of the organised crime gangs, many of whom have links to paramilitaries and former paramilitaries, that are responsible for the bulk of fuel fraud.\u00a0 Revenue's enforcement strategy in the fuel sector has already yielded significant results.  Since the beginning of 2011, over 3 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 9 oil laundries in 2013.  In addition, over 130 filling stations have been closed in that period. In the past 18 months Revenue has secured 6 convictions for mineral oil offences and a further 16 prosecution cases are underway.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The evidence available to Revenue, in terms of feedback from the legitimate trade and increased consumption of road diesel, indicates that the strategy has been effective.  The legitimate trade indicates that the incidence of laundered diesel on the market has dropped significantly and that they have experienced an increase in road diesel sales.\u00a0 This is supported by tax data which shows increasing consumption of road diesel. <\/p><p>  I am also advised by Revenue that they are investigating recent reports of petrol stretching, involving the illegal addition of kerosene to petrol.  I understand that Revenue have taken samples from a number of filling stations reported to them by motorists and that they are pursuing enquiries to establish if petrol stretching has occurred and whether there is evidence to support\u00a0 prosecution.\u00a0 In light of the very successful cooperation between Revenue and the oil industry to tackle diesel laundering, I am confident that with similar cooperation and the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully. It is essential that petrol distributors report any change in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade, which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or &quot;stretched&quot; fuel. <\/p><p>  Motorists themselves should report to Revenue any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines.  Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions where possible.  In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the black economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400064#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2015","counter":511,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400064#WRL00350"},{"type":"question","counter":512,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[41359\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400064#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the projected structural deficit for 2015 and 2016; the medium target for closing the structural deficit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":513,"content":"<p>The latest projections, which are published in Budget 2015, are that the structural balance\u00a0will reach -3.4 per cent of GDP in 2015, before improving further to -2.5 per cent\u00a0of GDP in 2016.

Earlier this year, NAMA announced that, in line with its obligations under Section 10 of the NAMA Act, it considered that the best financial outcome for the State would be achieved through a managed process of accelerating disposals in an orderly way with the target of redeeming 80% of senior debt (a cumulative &euro;24 billion) by end-2016.\u00a0 Following on from the Section 227 review of NAMA which was conducted by my Department, I fully endorsed NAMA's strategy of seeking to take full advantage of strong market conditions to reduce the contingent liability on taxpayers represented by NAMA's senior, State-guaranteed, bonds.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  I am advised by NAMA that, in order to achieve its revised debt redemption targets, it must arrange for the sale not only of individual assets but also of portfolios of loans and property assets to investors.

Indeed, it would not be fair or reasonable to displace tenants in order to offer the apartments for sale to purchasers\u00a0as either individual units or as part of a portfolio.  As the properties are already tenanted, they form part of current housing supply and displacing one category of housing tenure to accommodate another category would not add to  overall housing supply.\u00a0 I would also point out that the purchasers of apartment blocks are usually large investors who tend to apply fully professional standards in their capacity as landlords and this is something that I fully welcome given the need, in any properly functioning property market, for a well-managed private rental sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400064#WRL02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge Yield","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400064#WRL02950"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[41452\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400064#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of revenue raised and the number of persons through the imposition of a 45% USC rate on bank bonuses with a breakdown by year.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>Section 531AAD of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a charge on bonus payments that exceed &euro;20,000, paid to employees of financial institutions that received financial support from the State under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.\u00a0 This charge, the &quot;excess bank remuneration charge&quot;, is incorporated into the Universal Social Charge and applies in all respects as if it was USC except that it is charged at a higher rate of 45%.

I have no plans to undo those changes. \u00a0It is important to emphasize, however, that the SFT regime and the changes made to it last year do not impact on the vast majority of individuals in pension saving arrangements. <\/p><p>  The SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by dealing with it at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. The regime achieves this by imposing a significant tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. In this way it acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the significant tax charge, the tax relief granted.<\/p><p>  The main changes made by Budget 2014 and Finance (No 2) Act 2013 can be summarised as follows:<\/p><p>  -\tFirstly, the absolute capital value of the SFT was reduced, with effect from 1 January 2014, from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m.\u00a0<\/p><p>  -\tSecondly, the valuation factor to be used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit (DB) pension rights at the point of retirement, where this takes place after 1 January 2014, has been changed from a standard valuation factor of 20 to a range of higher age related valuation factors that will vary with the individual's age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down.<\/p><p>  -\tLastly, in calculating the capital value of a DB pension at the point of retirement, transitional arrangements provide for a  split  calculation where part of the pension had already been accrued at 1 January 2014 so that the part accrued up to that date will be valued at a factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date valued at the appropriate higher age-related valuation factor.<\/p><p>  As occurred on the occasion of the introduction of the SFT regime in 2005, and again when the value of the SFT limit was reduced to &euro;2.3m in 2010, the legislation contained in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for an individual who has pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, to claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or  grandfather  the value of those rights on that date.  This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m, and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs. <\/p><p>  The changes and grandfathering arrangements outlined above apply, as appropriate, to DB and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400065#WRM00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400065#WRM00450"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[41507\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400065#WRM00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the measures in budget 2015 that will help the so-called squeezed middle; his plans for future budgets in helping the squeezed middle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so.  The measures announced in the Budget are the first stage of a reform plan, to be undertaken over a number of years, to address this issue, particularly for middle-income earners who have borne the greater share of the cost of the economic downturn.<\/p><p>  In Budget 2015 I have reduced the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40%. \u00a0I have also extended the standard rate band on which income tax is chargeable at the lower 20% rate by &euro;1,000.  These measures ensure that all those currently earning in excess of &euro;32,800 per annum will benefit from the tax changes in the Budget.<\/p><p>  In addition I have reduced the two lower rates at which USC is payable from 2% and 4% to 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively.  Furthermore, I have also increased\u00a0the threshold before which the 7% rate of USC becomes payable to &euro;17,576, so that those on the minimum wage will now only be liable to a maximum 3.5% rate of USC.<\/p><p>  The Budget also provides for the retention of the exemption from the top rates of USC for medical card holders with incomes that do not exceed &euro;60,000. These individuals will now only be liable to pay a USC rate of 3.5%, down from 4%.  This reduced rate will also apply to the over 70s, with incomes that do not exceed &euro;60,000, again down from 4%.<\/p><p>  Ireland already has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world.  To preserve that progressivity, the Budget also contains USC measures which have the effect of limiting the maximum benefit from this package of tax measures to approximately &euro;14 per week for any individual taxpayer, which means that those with very high incomes will only benefit to the same extent, as those with more modest incomes.<\/p><p>  The changes announced in the Budget will ensure that all those currently paying income tax and\/or USC will see a reduction in their tax bill in 2015.

Subcontractors, who are not already registered for RCT, will be automatically registered for RCT on foot of a contract notification from a principal contractor. \u00a0On submission of this contract information by the principal contractor, the subcontractor is immediately issued with a 'Contract Confirmation' letter, with full details of the nature of the engagement between the principal and the subcontractor, and the subcontractor is advised that he\/she is obliged by law to contact Revenue if any of the details of the engagement are materially incorrect.  It is at this point that workers with concerns should respond to Revenue and if the Deputy has any information in this regard, he should encourage them to do so.<br\/><br\/>Failing any objection to the nature of the engagement the Principal is issued with a deduction rate notification, i.e. RCT will be deducted at 0%, 20% or 35%, as appropriate, from any payments made under the contract.  Registering for RCT is a necessary pre-requisite to enable a principal or subcontractor to comply with their RCT obligations and, consequently, refusing to register a principal or subcontractor does not arise.<br\/><br\/>On the eRCT system, before notifying a contract to Revenue, a principal contractor must already have satisfied themselves that the contract being entered into with the sub-contractor is not a 'contract of service' that is one in which the relationship between the principal and the sub-contractor is in the nature of an employer\/employee. \u00a0In addition, where the contract is a labour only contract, the principal contractor is required to supply additional information regarding the contract (similar to the information that a principal had previously been required to consider on the Form RCT1).<br\/><br\/>Decisions about employed or self-employed status of workers have to be made on the facts and the 'Code of Practice for Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals' is designed to assist both parties to a contract to determine if that contract is, by its nature, either:<br\/><br\/>-A 'contract of services', \u00a0that is, an employer employee arrangement, in which case the PAYE system applies to payments made, or<br\/><br\/>-A 'contract for services' that is, not an employer employee arrangement, in which case the eRCT system applies.<br\/><br\/>The 'Code of Practice for Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals' is not a Revenue Code, but rather was compiled collaboratively by the following bodies, which are all members of the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group - ICTU, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, NERA, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Finance, the SFA, IBEC, CIF and Revenue.<br\/><br\/>The primary responsibility in relation to employment rights rest with NERA, in relation to PRSI entitlements with the Department of Social Protection and the proper implementation of the tax code with Revenue.

For example, in 2006, Ireland demonstrated its commitment and leadership in the area of debt relief by contributing its full financial share of over &euro;116 million to the two main multilateral initiatives to address debt relief, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, while other States opted to pay for this debt cancellation over a much longer period and in smaller instalments.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, Ireland has pledged its share of the profits from recent IMF gold sales, totaling 12.94 million SDR (Special Drawing Rights), the asset reserve used by the IMF, which equates to some &euro;15 million, to subsidize lending to low-income countries, which may currently borrow at zero interest from the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), the IMF's concessional lending vehicle.<\/p><p>  As more and more countries graduate from the multilateral debt relief initiatives, the question of how they can maintain their debt at sustainable levels has become more relevant.\u00a0 In this regard, Ireland contributes &euro;100,000 annually to the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System programme operated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which provides software solutions and technical assistance to developing countries to manage their debt sustainably.<\/p><p>  Debt relief to developing countries, and loans from the International Financial Institutions, are often conditional on the implementation of certain macro-economic and development policies.\u00a0 The Government takes the view that interventions by the International Financial Institutions should take into account country ownership of their programmes, poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.<\/p><p>  I welcome the ongoing process of reform within the World Bank and the IMF to ensure they can adequately meet the development challenges of a changing world.\u00a0 Ireland has supported the governance reforms of recent years and shifts in quotas and voting power in favour of developing and transition countries.\u00a0 These have served to increase the legitimacy and democratic representation of the International Financial Institutions.<\/p><p>  I understand that the IMF does not generally lend to countries whose debt is considered unsustainable and that its policies require it to conduct an in-depth assessment of a country's debt sustainability before it commits to a lending program.

The measures announced in the Budget are the first stage of a reform plan, to be undertaken over a number of years, to address this issue, particularly for low and middle-income earners who have borne the greater share of the cost of the economic downturn.<\/p><p>  In Budget 2015 I have reduced the two lower rates at which USC is payable from 2% and 4% to 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively.  I have also increased the bands of income on which these new lower rates will apply.  Furthermore, I have also increased the threshold before which the 7% rate of USC becomes payable to &euro;17,576, so that those on the minimum wage will now only be liable to a maximum 3.5% rate of USC.<\/p><p>  The Budget also provides for the retention of the exemption from the top rates of USC for medical card holders with incomes that do not exceed &euro;60,000.  These individuals will now only be liable to pay a maximum USC rate of 3.5%, down from 4%.  This reduced rate will also apply to the over 70s, with incomes that do not exceed &euro;60,000, again down from 4%.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the over 65s,\u00a0who currently pay USC, will benefit from these changes regardless of whether they opt for assessment under the general\u00a0income tax system, or the age exemptions and marginal relief systems.  Such individuals can of course elect for assessment under whichever system proves more beneficial to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400066#WRN02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Payments","counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400066#WRN02150"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":337,"qnumall":"[41976\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400066#WRN02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) is being requested to pay back tax when cheques for sick leave were not cashed by the person; if he will clarify with the Revenue Commissioners that these cheques during a period of sick leave were not cashed; and if the person's tax liability could be rectified as a result.","asker":"1023","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in accordance with section 126 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 the person concerned is chargeable to income tax in respect of the Illness Benefit paid to him by the Department of Social Protection. <\/p><p>  In the details supplied it is mentioned that the person concerned has not cashed his Illness Benefit cheques.

As part of the scheme's risk control framework, provision was made for certain restrictions on the means by which the auto-diesel concerned may be purchased.  Purchases in bulk must be made from a licensed mineral oil trader, and delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of that qualifying road transport operator. <\/p><p>  Bulk purchases from licensed mineral oil traders can be verified by reference to the monthly electronic returns that the oil traders are required to make to Revenue.  These returns form part of the supply chain controls introduced by Revenue to tackle the problem of illicit fuel, prior to the introduction of the diesel rebate scheme.  The return provides an electronic record of the purchases, stock movements and sales of mineral oil each month by licenced mineral oil traders, by oil product type, including bulk sales to customers exceeding 2000 litres. This information can be used to verify electronically claims for bulk purchases under the diesel rebate scheme.  A reduction in the minimum bulk purchase requirement for the diesel rebate scheme would require a corresponding reduction in the minimum threshold for purchases to be reported by mineral oil traders in their monthly returns, greatly increasing the number of transactions to be reported in these returns and the related administrative burden on the mineral oil traders.<\/p><p>  Purchases by means of a fuel card, approved by Revenue for the purpose of the scheme, also qualify for repayment.\u00a0 There is no minimum requirement on purchases made in this way, so it is not clear to me how this can be considered discrimination against a small operator. \u00a0Fuel cards are widely available and are usable across the road network and there are a number of fuel card providers who can supply suitable fuel cards to road transport operators and fuel retailers.

However, in this instance, I understand the sale was discussed at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Finance Committee and my understanding of the matter is based on NAMA's testimony to that Committee.<br\/><br\/>NAMA's policy is that the sale of all loans and the sale of properties by debtors and receivers should be openly marketed to ensure that the best price available in the market is achieved in all instances.<b><\/b>NAMA enjoys a strong reputation in the market for the quality of information it provides as part of its open market loan sale process and for the transparent and professional manner in which such\u00a0transactions have been\u00a0completed to date.  Its loan sales process is built on international best practice and it uses experienced advisers to ensure that transactions are executed to the highest market standards and that bidders are treated equally by mapping out a clear and rigorous process to be followed in each loan sale.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>I understand that, in this instance, the rules and format of the bidding process and the fact that NAMA would consider only unconditional binding bids at the end of the Phase II due diligence were made clear to all bidders in the process.\u00a0 Mitigation of execution risk is standard industry practice in any loan sales process and to accept conditional bids, contingent on funding, would expose NAMA to accusations of being reckless and irresponsible with the interests of Irish taxpayers and would damage its credibility and, by extension, that of Ireland, internationally.\u00a0It could also be exposed to complaints from underbidders who could reasonably contend that they were disadvantaged because they had faithfully abided by the rules which had been established at the outset. \u00a0<br\/><br\/>There are substantial costs associated with the preparation and submission of bids on large transactions and any suggestion of unfairness or of a lack of professionalism in the process would be likely to alienate potential bidders.  I am satisfied that if NAMA had not set out the ground rules for this loan sale with the utmost clarity and if, instead, it had left room for the inclusion of conditionality and ambiguity in the framing of bids, particularly around funding, it would have discouraged credible counterparties from participating in the process.  It would also have left itself open to disputation as to what constituted the best price and ultimately would have risked losing value for Irish taxpayers.<br\/><br\/>The NAMA Chief Executive advised the Oireachtas Joint Finance Committee that the differential between the conditional bid and the successful bid was not material in the context of the price ultimately achieved.  I understand that the differential was considerably outweighed by the execution risk that attached to the conditional bid and by potential negotiation over\u00a0a\u00a0warranty package and it would have been unacceptable for NAMA to put Irish taxpayers' interests at risk in such circumstances.<br\/><br\/>In the case of large loan and asset sales generally, compliant bidders cannot be expected to let their bids stand while a conditional bidder is allowed additional time to finalise an offer.\u00a0 The industry experience is that some bidders seek to use conditional offers to eliminate fully funded bidders from the process with the aim of ultimately seeking to reduce their own conditional bid.\u00a0\u00a0<br\/><br\/>I am not for a moment suggesting that this scenario applied in this particular instance.  However, it is entirely understandable that NAMA would wish to preside over a sales process which was rigorous and professional in its execution and fair to all bidding parties.  This was necessary not only to secure the integrity of this particular sale but also of any future NAMA loan sales.  It is important for NAMA, and indeed more broadly for Ireland's reputation internationally, that sales processes such as this be conducted in a manner which is above reproach. I am satisfied that NAMA adhered faithfully to its own stringent process for assessing competing bids in this case and that it obtained the best price on offer to it having assessed the risks attaching to\u00a0 the bids received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400066#WRN04100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Settlements","counter":669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400066#WRN04450"},{"type":"question","counter":670,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[42269\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400066#WRN04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding an appeal submitted to the Revenue Commissioners by a person in County Cork (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

If one Party has breached the &quot;essential elements&quot;, the other Party would be entitled to adopt proportionate measures without delay. There could be consultations between governments in order to clarify and discuss the situation, but such consultations would not have suspensive effects &ndash; that is, the action taken as a response to the violation of &quot;essential elements&quot; would deploy its full effects pending the outcome of consultations.<br\/><br\/>Reactions to a breach of &quot;essential elements&quot; can take different forms. As regards the suspension of international agreements, Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets out the procedure to follow: it is for the Council, on a proposal from the Commission or the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to adopt a decision suspending application of an international agreement. The European Parliament must be immediately and fully informed throughout the procedure.<br\/><br\/>In any event, the Agreement needs to be seen in the context of the broader relations between the EU and Colombia and Peru, where Human Rights are very high on the agenda. Human Rights issues are regularly raised through the existing mechanisms for political dialogue such as the Human Rights dialogue with Colombia. Those channels for political engagement form a privileged platform to conduct regular exchanges and oversight.<br\/><br\/>The Agreement confirms the Parties' commitments to effectively implement both in law and in practice the Core Labour Standards, as contained in the ILO Fundamental Conventions. The reference to the Fundamental Conventions is important in order to guarantee that the provision will be interpreted in line with their legal provisions. The commitment to promote and implement the Core Labour Standards reflects the international understanding that countries should not seek to gain a competitive advantage in international trade through the violation of basic labour rules.<br\/><br\/>Both Colombia and Peru have ratified all eight Fundamental Conventions. Despite significant progress in recent years, implementation problems persist in some areas, requiring additional efforts and cooperation with the ILO. EU bilateral cooperation can also support specific improvements on the ground.<br\/><br\/>On the environmental front, the Agreement reaffirms the commitment to effectively implement eight key Multilateral Environmental Agreements (&quot;MEAs&quot;) with a special importance in the trade context (Article 270). Those agreements are the seven MEAs covered under the GSP+ scheme, plus the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent. By integrating the commitment to give effect to MEAs, the Agreement ensures that key environmental requirements are given due weight in domestic policy-making and are not subordinated to economic interests, including when devising trade-related measures.<br\/><br\/>Civil society organisations and citizens have an important role in the implementation of the &quot;trade and sustainable development&quot; Title of the Agreement. They can raise concerns or express views on labour or environmental matters. There will be regular meetings and, on every occasion, there must be an open session where civil society organisations and citizens can directly raise issues. All decisions or reports must be made public<br\/><br\/>In line with other EU trade agreements, there will be an important institutional development in order to ensure operational channels for consultation with civil society: Article 281 lays down the functions of domestic advisory committees or groups composed of civil society representatives, with a balanced representation of economic, social and environmental interests. Those committees or groups must be consulted and can also make recommendations on their own initiative.<br\/><br\/>Civil society organisations will therefore oversee the implementation of the provisions in the Title on &quot;Trade and Sustainable Development&quot; (TSD), but their input can extend to the broader operation of the Agreement. In particular, there will be ex-post impact assessments of the implementation of the Agreement in its entirety, through each Party's participative processes as well as jointly (Articles 279 and 280(6)).<br\/><br\/>The EU-Colombia\/Peru Trade Agreement sets out that each Party consults existing, or creates domestic labour and environment or sustainable development, committees or groups (DAGs) with the task of advising on the implementation of the TSD title. The DAGs are comprised of a balanced representation of representative organisations in sustainable development (Article 281).<br\/><br\/>The EU has opted for setting up a DAG composed of 3 members of the EESC as well as other representatives of EU trade unions, business associations and NGOs. The EU foresees close cooperation with the EESC in the DAG's management. Organisations participating in the EU DAG met the 30 January 2014.  The EU DAG will continue to meet on a regular basis. The European Commission participates in part of the DAG's meetings and ensures a continuous dialogue with its advisory group. Colombia and Peru opted for building on existing domestic consultative mechanisms covering environmental and labour in order to ensure civil society's advice on the implementation of the TSD title.<br\/><br\/>The EU-Colombia\/Peru Trade Agreement provides for a mechanism for open dialogue between the Parties and civil society organisations and the public at large (Article 282) that is convened by the EU-Colombia\/Peru Sub-committee on TSD at least once a year, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. Procedures for such sessions foresee that the EU-Colombia\/Peru TSD Sub-committee provides for the chairs of the session with civil society and that each party invites and encourages the participation of the civil society members of its DAG.

This will see a reduction in the number of agencies or bodies under the remit of this Department fall by 41. This includes the dissolution of 35 City and County Enterprise Boards, the merging of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, the integration of Forf&aacute;s into the Department, the integration of Shannon Development into a new Shannon Group and the consolidation of the five workplace relations bodies into two. <br\/><br\/>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which was established on 31<sup>st<\/sup>October, has 5 members and has a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law and will build on the work of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to protect and strengthen competition, empower consumers to make informed decisions and protect them from harmful business practices.  <br\/><br\/>The transfer of enterprise functions from Shannon Development to IDA, EI and tourism functions to Bord F&aacute;ilte took place during the last quarter of 2013.  The legislation to merge Shannon Development and Shannon Airport into a new commercial state company, State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014, was enacted on 27 July 2014. Responsibility for the newly formed Shannon Group PLC rests with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  <br\/><br\/>As the Deputy may be aware, on 15<sup>th<\/sup>April this year, the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards were dissolved under the County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Act, 2014.  On the same date, 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) were established. Under the legislation, the functions, assets and liabilities were transferred to Enterprise Ireland, and these functions are now being delivered on behalf of EI by the LEOs within the Local Authority structure. <br\/><br\/>Forf&aacute;s was integrated into my Department with effect from 1<sup>st<\/sup>August 2014 under the Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Act, 2014.  As part of this integration the functions of the Irish National Accreditation Board were transferred from Forf&aacute;s to the Health and Safety Authority.<br\/><br\/>A  Reform Programme also underway will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission.  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.<br\/><br\/>There will be savings made as a result of shared services and abolition of Boards but, more importantly, the new streamlined structures will provide a quicker, simpler and improved service for the taxpayer. The detailed nature of the costs and expenses savings are a day-to-day operational matter for the agencies in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400069#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":802,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400069#WRQ01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sc&eacute;im Limist&eacute;ar faoi Mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste","counter":801,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400069#WRQ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[40972\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400069#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"c&eacute;n uair a dh&eacute;anfar &iacute;oca&iacute;ocht faoi sc&eacute;im na limist&eacute;ar faoi mh&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste do 2014 le feirmeoir i gContae na Gaillimhe (sonra&iacute; leis seo); c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go bhfuil moill leis an &iacute;oca&iacute;ocht seo; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.

An agreement between the world&rsquo;s two major trading blocs has the potential to increase growth and grow jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. In the agri-food sector we have strong offensive interests, both in terms of market access and in eliminating some of the irritants that hinder trade. We are seeking substantial market access for our dairy products and in the prepared foods area. We also want to see action to action to address the question of Grade A equivalence for dairy and the licensing system that applies to dairy imports into the US.  Of course we have sensitivities as well. One of these is our beef sector. While we see some opportunities for establishing a niche market in the US for Irish beef, we have concerns regarding the prospect of increased beef imports into the EU. I have raised these concerns on a number of occasions with the EU Commission. I have proposed that Ireland&rsquo;s sensitivities are reflected in the size and composition of any quota offered to the US. I have argued that the size of the quota should not exceed European market absorption capacity, which is substantially reduced according to the latest forecasts. I have also proposed that the quota should be designed &ndash; via end use conditions &ndash; to ensure that imports are not all concentrated on high value cuts and I have argued that an in-quota tariff rate should continue to apply to imports within the quota.   <\/p><p>  The most recent report of the European Parliament on the trade implications of the EU US trade bears out these Irish concerns in relation to the suckler cow herd in Europe which it finds will be adversely affected by the trade deal. In my meetings with the new Agriculture Commissioner I will continue to outline our concerns and seek mitigating measures in relation to the beef sector.   <\/p><p>  There have been suggestions that the agreement will allow the US to export hormone treated meat into the EU. Just to clarify the position, a decision was taken many years ago to ban the use of hormones in animals in the EU destined for the human food chain. The ban forms part of the EU positive but precautionary principle to limit the use of medical treatments to disease prevention and cure. The US takes a different approach that allows the use of hormones in the absence of scientific evidence that they may cause harm.

A follow-on review of the business processes and procedures and, in particular, the administrative support requirements, in those 16 offices resulted in the introduction of a number of significant changes to the procedures in relation to the implementation of controls in the TB eradication programme. As a consequence of these changes and having regard to the significant efficiencies which have already arisen as a result of the investment made by my Department in IT in recent years, the number of staff required to deliver the service in the local offices has been considerably reduced. The review concluded that further substantial efficiencies would accrue from the centralisation of administrative support and, in light of this, my Department has commenced a process to centralise this support in 2 &lsquo;back office&rsquo; locations, namely Portlaoise and Cavan.  The centralisation of administrative functions will facilitate the redeployment of staff from my Department&rsquo;s Regional Offices to other State agencies and, thereby, enable Government to provide services through these agencies more efficiently. My Department has already engaged with the Garda Sioch&aacute;na, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners and the Payroll Shared Services Centre with a view to new work for Department staff affected by the reorganisation plan. Following the Government decision to locate one of the 3 Payroll Shared Services Centres in Galway, my Department has been requested to redeploy our administrative staff in Galway to that Centre. No date has been set yet for redeployment but the Department anticipates it likely to happen in mid 2015. As things stand at present, redeployment to the Shared Payroll Service will not involve administrative staff being moved from their current location in Renmore.   <\/p><p>  My Department is considering further administrative efficiencies, however i t is important to state that any   changes in staffing levels in my Department&rsquo;s Galway office will not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers. Department veterinary inspectors, agricultural inspectors and technical officers will remain in place and frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will continue to be available. Similar changes have taken place in the Department&rsquo;s offices in Clonakilty, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford and Enniscorthy without any negative implications for the provision of services to farmer clients. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400071#WRS03300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":939,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400071#WRS03350"},{"type":"question","counter":940,"qnumday":438,"qnumall":"[41600\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400071#WRS03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Cork will receive their AEOS 3 payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":941,"content":"<p>The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS 3) with effect from the 1 <sup>st <\/sup>May 2013 .

It is headed by a Senior Superintending Veterinary Officer, supported by a team of investigators, some of whom are core members of the team and others to be drawn from areas where their expertise will be beneficial to the conduct of particular types of investigations.<\/p><p>  A particular feature of the new arrangement is the governance that now surrounds the conduct of Departmental investigations. The new Investigations Division reports to an Investigations Steering Group chaired by the Assistant Secretary General responsible for Corporate Affairs and will comprise the Chief Veterinary Officer, the Assistant Secretary General with responsibility for direct payments, and the Heads of Legal Services, Internal Audit and HR. This group will, in all new cases, determine whether matters should be referred back to the relevant inspection areas of the Department for follow through, whether an investigation is warranted and if so, whether this should be conducted by the Investigations Division or referred to the Garda Sioch&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  Investigators continue to operate to a code of practice and any citizens who believe that they have been treated unfairly can seek redress through the internal complaints procedure, the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office or the courts.

As with any scheme, this will have to be managed within the available budget over time.  The proposed BDGP is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the quality and environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology.  This will help farmers to maximise productivity in a sustainable way, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd, as set out under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.   <\/p><p>  The programme will provide support to farmers to take samples for genotyping from selected animals in their herds and to provide vital breeding data to support the development of a national cattle breeding databank.  This data will then be returned to farmers in respect of their own animals and will provide them with the tools to select higher quality and more efficient breeding replacements based on criteria such as ease of calving, high weight gain thereafter, and animals that can be finished earlier.  The scheme will have a substantial environmental dividend while improving productivity, reducing input costs and improving margins for farmers.   <\/p><p>  As I set out in my budget speech, I have proposed to increase the amount of money available to all farmers within the scheme to &euro;100 a head on the first ten animals.\u00a0 Further animals in the herd will be paid &euro;80 per head.\u00a0 This budget will allow payments to be made in respect of some 565,000 animals.  The increase to &euro;100 in the payment for the first 10 animals is designed to achieve this and almost 300,000 animals will be eligible for this higher payment.  I am convinced that this programme can underpin the development of the suckler herd and stimulate a permanent improvement in the climate and production efficiency of the sector.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400073#WRU02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400073#WRU02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1026,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[42092\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400073#WRU03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views regarding the new labelling initiative being pursued by the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland and supported by the Northern Ireland meat industry and by Irish farmers which would allow for cattle born in the Republic of Ireland, fattened in Northern Ireland and slaughtered in Northern Ireland to be placed on the shelves of the major British retailers; the action he has taken to progress this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1027,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, there is a commercial preference at UK retail level, reflecting consumer preference there, for a simple origin labelling process bearing the name of a single EU member state only.  It must be recognised that this commercial purchasing strategy has facilitated the sale in major UK retail outlets of large quantities of beef from cattle born, reared and slaughtered in Ireland.  However, it adversely affects the market for beef from cattle of \"mixed origin\" such as those traditionally exported to Northern Ireland for fattening and slaughter.  <\/p><p>  I have been pro-active in supporting this traditional trade and have met on a number of occasions with my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill MLA.  We have also written jointly to the three UK retailers which currently stock Irish beef i.e. Tesco, Asda and Sainsburys asking them to consider a new mixed label for animals born reared or slaughtered in both jurisdictions on the island.  Minister O&rsquo;Neill has also approved a voluntary beef label in Northern Ireland for cattle born in the Republic of Ireland, raised in the Republic of Ireland and\/or Northern Ireland, and slaughtered in Northern Ireland.  This label would facilitate the sale of beef from animals born in the South and slaughtered in the North, while ensuring that the &quot;Origin Ireland&quot; label, which serves the Irish beef and other sectors so well, is protected in domestic and EU markets.  At this stage the voluntary label has been approved by the authorities in Northern Ireland but, of course, the question of using such a label is now a commercial matter between processors and retailers in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK.   <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to pursue this and other matters with the major retailers.  To this end, I invited a representative of Tesco to the Beef Roundtable meeting held last week and a very useful exchange of views took place with all of the stakeholders in the sector.  I also recently met with Minister O'Neill and the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium (NIRC) in Dublin to explore the labelling issue further.  In summary, the NIRC advised me that its members have considered the mixed label issue in some detail and have concluded that for the moment they are not prepared to change their labelling policies.  The NIRC has, however, agreed to keep the matter under review and I will continue to engage with them in this regard.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400073#WRU03100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":1028,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400073#WRU03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1029,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[42093\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400073#WRU03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views regarding the Bord Bia data which show that the key R3 steer cattle price here is now over &euro;1\/kg below the same R3 steer cattle price in the main export market in Britain and that this amounts to a price differential of over &euro;350 per animal; his plans to ensure farmers get a fair price for their cattle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1030,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, questions of price are ultimately matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle.  It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU to intervene directly on these issues.  Cattle prices are determined by supply\/demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by a range of different factors such as consumer preferences, distance to market, consumer confidence , retail promotions, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation.  <\/p><p>  It is, nonetheless, important that farmers are sufficiently remunerated for producing quality animals.  Beef producers must be provided with appropriate production incentives that are reflective of market demands and are communicated to producers in a clear and timely manner.  I will continue to engage with both farmers and processors to ensure that the market operates in a fair and transparent manner.  My role is to create a policy support environment that will allow the beef sector to flourish in line with normal market principles.   <\/p><p>  I am committed to working with farmers and industry to deal with evolving price levels and to ensure we have the right measures in place to aid producers achieve better margins on their farms.<\/p><p>  I have been actively engaging with the sector with the aim of mitigating the impact of the drop in prices from the highs experienced last year. <\/p><p>  In the recent budget, I announced a total package of approximately &euro;74 million for the beef sector in 2015, including a provision of &euro;52 million for a proposed Beef Data and Genomics Programme which will place Ireland at the leading edge globally in the use of genomics in beef production.  The current Genomics Scheme is being further developed and enhanced as part of a 6-year RDP measure which, once approved by the European Commission, will deliver a payment per animal of &euro;100 for the first ten animals, with the remaining animals being eligible for an &euro;80 payment per animal in participating herds. <\/p><p>  The budget package also includes an additional sum of &euro;9 million to fund the Beef Data Programme, &euro;6 million to assist farmer participation in the Beef Quality Assurance Scheme, and a further &euro;1 million for Bord Bia in support of its marketing of Irish products abroad, with a particular emphasis on beef.  In addition there is continued budgetary provision for knowledge transfer in the sector through the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and support funding for investments in marketing and processing in the beef sector. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, I established a Beef Roundtable earlier this year to facilitate such discussions between the parties and I convened the third meeting of this group last week.  This meeting had a wide-ranging agenda and maintained a focus on the strategic development of the beef sector. \u00a0All of the main stakeholders were present, including farm bodies, meat processors and Government agencies.  For the first time the round table included an exchange of views with the buyers of Tesco and McDonalds, who together are the biggest buyers of Irish beef, both by volume and value.  The meeting was updated as regards the good progress made in implementing the recommendations of the Dowling report which I had commissioned as part of the Roundtable process.  In addition, the stakeholders provided a strong endorsement for the establishment of farmer owned Producer Organisations in the beef sector to help to rebalance negotiating power along the supply chain. <\/p><p>  At my request, farm groups and processors have also agreed to engage in intensive discussions over a two week period on the commercial issues in dispute, under an independent chair, Mr.\u00a0Michael Dowling.  For my part, I have agreed to hold another meeting of the forum next week to review progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400073#WRU03400","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Technology Adoption Programme","counter":1031,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400073#WRU03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1032,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[42094\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400073#WRU03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason there is no provision in his Department's Estimates for the beef technology adoption programme for 2015; if this means that farmers under the programme will receive no BTAP payment in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1033,"content":"<p>The Beef Technology Adoption Programme commenced as a three year programme in 2012 and therefore concludes at the end of 2014.

I understand that all personnel have made a full recovery and that their cases were reported to the Irish Medicines Board at the time.  In addition there was a further seven personnel with less dramatic symptomatology which were under review.  There was no conclusive evidence that Lariam was a factor in any of those cases.  <\/p><p>  I am further advised that details of Defence Forces personnel&rsquo;s rank are not provided in association with details of personnel&rsquo;s medical conditions, as this could possibly lead to identification of the personnel involved.

Since 1974 UNDOF  has been a successful mission, supporting the efforts of the international community in maintaining peace and security both in the Golan Heights, and also in the broader region.  The mandate of UNDOF has been renewed every six months.  The current mandate, which was renewed last June, expires on 31 December 2014.    <\/p><p>  The current Defence Forces contingent, the 46th Irish Infantry Group UNDOF, comprises 130 troops and consists of a Force Reserve Company and support elements.  Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with ongoing operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.  They are tasked with carrying out patrols and convoy escorts as necessary.  The Force Reserve Company is also tasked with being prepared to reinforce vulnerable UN positions in the Golan Heights and to assist in securing, extraction, and evacuation of UN personnel under threat.<\/p><p>  In addition to the Force Reserve Company, there are eight (8) other Defence Forces personnel based in UNDOF Headquarters, Camp Ziouani, including the Deputy Force Commander Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon, who took up his appointment on 20 September 2014.  An Irish officer has also taken on the role of Chief Operations Officer in the force.<\/p><p>  Fighting between Syrian Arab Armed Forces and Anti Government Armed Elements has recently escalated in the UNDOF area of responsibility.  In August 2014 and in response to the hostilities, the Irish contingent, in its capacity as the Force Reserve Company, dealt with several incidents as requested by the Force Commander UNDOF, including assisting with the safe extraction of members of the Philippine Battalion.  In the course of these incidents Irish troops came under fire and returned fire.  <\/p><p>  Given events on the ground, I called for the UN to undertake a review of the mission, particularly the capacity of the mission to fulfil its mandate in light of the civil war in Syria.  I discussed this review of the mission with the Under Secretary General in the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations.  Since then there has been a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimising unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate.  The Headquarters of the UNDOF mission, including the Irish contingent, has now been relocated from Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation to Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  The UNDOF mission has evacuated all but one of the posts in the southern half of the area of responsibility.  Movement in the area of responsibility is also restricted.  A Nepalese contingent, of approximately 100 personnel, is still posted in the Mount Hermon area in the zone of separation.  The realignment reflects the deteriorating situation on the ground and endeavours to minimize the risk to personnel, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate.<\/p><p>  In September 2014, the Presidency of the UN Security Council issued a strong statement, reaffirming the Council&rsquo;s unconditional support for the UNDOF mission and emphasising the importance of maintaining UNDOF as a vital contributor to peace and security in the Middle East.  The Security Council also noted that it was important to maintain UNDOF&rsquo;s force strength to the level necessary to carry out its important mandate, and to retain the quick reaction and counter-IED capabilities, which are provided by Ireland and which the Council noted have proved indispensable in the face of the changing security environment.<\/p><p>  On 12 September, the UN Secretary-General reported to the UN Security Council on activities in the UNDOF mission area during the preceding three months.  The mission was further discussed at a meeting of the UN Security Council which was held on 20 October.  This meeting addressed possible options for the evolution of the mission, which will include its further reconfiguration, which are dependent on the security situation on the ground.  The UN review on the reconfiguration of the mission is an ongoing process and the UN Secretary-General will provide regular updates on the mission to the Security Council in this regard.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400074#WRV02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"White Paper on Defence","counter":1084,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400074#WRV03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1085,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[42168\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400074#WRV03100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"when the White Paper on Defence will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1086,"content":"<p>Work on the new White Paper on Defence is progressing well.

As regards existing ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in his or her dwelling.  To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme. In the case of property other than dwellings, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple in certain cases subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar.  Comprehensive details of the manner in which the fee simple can be purchased under these schemes are available on the Property Registration Authority's website (www.prai.ie).<\/p><p>  As regards the constitutionality issue, the position is that the ground rents issue was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in their 2004 Report 'Private Property'.  The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation.  The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant.  In light of the foregoing, I have no immediate plans to introduce further legislation in this area.

It is obviously a very difficult story to tell and she has taken a brave, public stance in telling it.  It is a pity that those who have questions to answer in relation to her mistreatment have, in stark contrast, relied on evasion and distortion.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will understand that the events recounted took place in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Director of Public Prosecutions has announced an independent review of the handling by the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland of criminal cases linked to this case.  It is the case also that the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is engaged in an investigation of the handling of this case by the PSNI.<br\/><br\/>We should, however, be clear about one thing: it is not now nor has it ever been acceptable for anyone to seek to suppress the reporting of sexual offences to the appropriate authorities or to seek to protect rapists or sex abusers.  Whenever these brutal crimes occur they need to be investigated thoroughly and in accordance with the law.  The Deputy clearly shares my concern at the grave implications of abusers not being reported to the authorities but instead having been moved elsewhere.  It is imperative that any person or organisation which has information about persons who might pose risks to children passes on that information to the authorities who will pursue it fully.<br\/><br\/>I have spoken with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Minister David Ford, about these issues and we will be discussing the matter further in the context of ongoing North-South co-operation on criminal justice matters to see whether there are any additional actions that we might usefully consider.<br\/><br\/>I will make the general point that whatever the circumstances, it is never easy for victims of rape and sexual abuse to come forward with their complaints and to speak out, and when they do they deserve to be listened to and to be treated with sensitivity and respect.<br\/><br\/>Victims of abuse in this jurisdiction can report sexual offences to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have clear and long-standing guidelines in place for dealing with such complaints which are strongly focused on adopting a sensitive approach to the complainant.  The Garda&iacute; will investigate any complaints of sexual offences reported to them and they work closely with the health and other social services, and with services such as the Rape Crisis Centre, in dealing with such complaints.<br\/><br\/>In this jurisdiction there is 24-hour helpline for victims of sexual violence which is operated by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre that is staffed by highly trained people.  There are also a range of other numbers available where one can speak to some of the fifteen other rape crisis centres around the country.  Victims can find contact details and information for can be found at  .<br\/><br\/>I encourage any victims of sexual violence to use these avenues to come forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400075#WRW03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":1132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400075#WRW03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1133,"qnumday":502,"qnumall":"[41083\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400075#WRW03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will review a stamp 4 application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1134,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person in question was issued with a letter granting them permission to remain in the State on 15 October 2014.

A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose.  The counsel appointed to the panel, and who were all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system, are: <\/p><p>  Senior Counsel: Conor Devally, Paul Greene.<\/p><p>  Junior Counsel:  Paul Carroll, John Fitzgerald, Tony McGillicuddy, Siobh&aacute;n Ni Ch&uacute;lach&aacute;in, Karen O'Connor.<\/p><p>  Appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that nothing arises which might in any way detract from the integrity of the review mechanism, including issues of conflict of interest.  Arrangements have been put in place  to ensure that if there is any conflict, or potential conflict, the conflicted counsel not only will not be involved in the particular complaint, but also will not be aware of which counsel is reviewing it.  This is normal professional conduct and there are sufficient counsel on the Panel to ensure the practicality of this.  Whatever steps are necessary will be taken to ensure there is no conflict of interest.<\/p><p>    It was originally anticipated that the review would last some ten to twelve weeks.  However, the availability of Counsel due to the operation of the Courts calendar together with the volume of complaints submitted means that this timeframe will be exceeded.  As I already mentioned, it is important that nothing arises which might detract from the integrity of the review mechanism.  It is therefore considered inappropriate to place a time constraint upon the working of the Panel, although they intend to conclude their work as soon is reasonably practicable.<\/p><p>  I understand the panel have to date reviewed almost 140 cases and I expect recommendations to be submitted to me in due course.  I will decide whether any further action is desirable and could practicably be taken in each case in light of the recommendations made by Counsel on the Panel, and each complainant will be notified accordingly.  While it would not be appropriate to publish individual recommendations, I will consider how best information on the outcome of this process could be made public.<\/p><p>  While the independent review mechanism was established as a temporary measure, it was envisaged that there might be a need to consider the case for a continuing capacity to review further cases which may arise in the future.  I have no doubt that the contents of the recommendations received from the Panel will inform how we deal with such issues once the independent review mechanism has concluded its work.<\/p><p>  The Deputies will be aware however that, as part of the Government's comprehensive programme of reform in the areas of policing and justice in the State, I am bringing forward new legislation to amend the Garda Siochana Act 2005 to strengthen the remit and powers of GSOC, which is the statutory independent body set up under the Act with oversight functions in relation to the Garda Siochana.  One of the legislative changes is to broaden the scope for me as Minister to refer any matter that gives rise to a concern to GSOC for investigation, and I would envisage GSOC as the primary mechanism for the future examination of allegations of this nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400076#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":1175,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400076#WRX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1176,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[41496\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400076#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on investing in portable metal detectors for the Garda to use in helping to deal with knife crime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1177,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy.

This included 159 prisoners who were serving less than 3 months solely for the non-payment of a Court ordered fine and 208 prisoners who were on structured temporary release programmes such as the community return Programme or Community Support Scheme.<br\/><br\/>The legislative basis for making decisions on temporary release are fully set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003.<br\/><br\/>A prisoner may apply through the prison Governor for consideration for temporary release for family reasons.  Their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation made by the prison authorities and\/or therapeutic services is to that effect. Each application is considered on its individual merits and a number of factors are taken into account when making a decision on whether to grant temporary release including:<br\/><br\/>- the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates;<br\/><br\/>- the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed;<br\/><br\/>- the period of the sentence served by the person;<br\/><br\/>- the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released;<br\/><br\/>- the person's previous criminal record;<br\/><br\/>- the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release;<br\/><br\/>- the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release;<br\/><br\/>- any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Probation &amp;amp; Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release;<br\/><br\/>- the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release;<br\/><br\/>- the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release;<br\/><br\/>- the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 and the  Joint Prison Service\/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2013-2015 includes commitments to ensure that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.<br\/><br\/>The Community Return Scheme is an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners, serving sentences between 1 year and 8 years, can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting. The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.<br\/><br\/>In addition to Community Return, a community Support Scheme has also been set reduce the current recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release.<br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><b>Table 1.

The scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the presiding judge who are under the Constitution independent in the exercise of their judicial functions. The Presidents monitor waiting times across all courts lists and seek to ensure the optimum use of court time. The Deputy may wish to refer to Section 6 of the Courts Service Annual Report for 2013 which sets out details on waiting times across the various court jurisdictions, including the Supreme and High Courts.<\/p><p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the primary objective for the Service is to maintain the delivery of front line court sittings and services.  The Courts Service continuously works to support the judiciary and assist in ensuring that cases are dealt with as effectively and as speedily as possible.  Available resources and operational and organisational structures are under ongoing review to ensure that resources are targeted and focussed on keeping waiting times in the provision of services to a minimum.<\/p><p>  In respect of waiting times in the Supreme Court, I am informed that the appointment of the two additional judges halted the increase in  the  waiting  times  for the hearing of cases in that Court  even with an increase in appeals being lodged.  Waiting times stabilised at 48 months for general cases and 11 months for the priority list.<\/p><p>  Remedial  actions were taken to reduce the number of uncertified cases to be heard.  A total of 563 appeals were disposed of by  the  Supreme  Court  up to 30 September this  year  in  its continuing  programme  of  managing uncertified appeals.  In the year to 30 September 2014 there was a 7.5% increased in new appeals lodged and a 223% increase in the number of appeals disposed of when compared with the same period in 2013.<\/p><p>  Despite the significant number of appeals disposed of, at the end of September, it is estimated that there is still in excess of 1,000 uncertified appeals where the appellant has not taken the necessary steps, as yet, to certify the appeal as being ready to be heard.<\/p><p>  The new Court of Appeal was established on 28 October 2014 and the Article 64 direction given by the Chief Justice on 29th October transferred 258 certified appeals to the Court of Appeal.  This will impact positively on waiting times for individual appeals but it is too early to determine the effect it will have on average waiting times for hearings in the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>  The Courts Service does not maintain statistics on the number of cases pending in the High Court as the number of cases set down for trial in any list of the High Court does not equate to the number of cases ready and waiting for trial. However, the level of delays in the High Court is very low across almost all lists. In general, waiting times vary from 1 to 5 months except in relation to Asylum cases where the delay is currently over 2 years and also in regard to the hearing of Personal Injury cases in Cork where the waiting time is just under 2 years. Waiting times in the Central Criminal Court are 17 months at present.<\/p><p>  I have been informed that additional High Court sittings were held during August and September with a view to maintaining the improvements made in waiting times in recent years.  During this period, the High Court dealt with bail lists on one or two days each week and sat each day and during several weekends to hear matters arising of an urgent nature.<\/p><p>  The ongoing delegation to court officials of administrative functions previously  dealt with by the High Court judges has also yielded significant savings in judicial times resulting in increased judicial availability for trial work.  The re-organisation of sittings of the High Court outside Dublin by the President of the High Court also continues to achieve efficiencies in the use of judicial time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400077#WRY02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Promotions","counter":1248,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400077#WRY02950"},{"type":"question","counter":1249,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[41964\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400077#WRY03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current\u00a0vacancies\u00a0in senior Garda posts; when she will fill these posts; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1250,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda Regions, Divisions and Districts, the various Garda national units and of course Garda Headquarters.

Garda actions under the Plan include dedicated high visibility patrols in key commercial and public thoroughfares.  These patrols are informed by crime trends, demand studies and footfall in the areas in question.  I am also aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages extensively with business and community interests in the city centre area with respect to crime prevention, enforcement and policing concerns.<br\/><br\/>The Garda approach includes focusing resources on specific areas of the city according to need.As part of this, a number of targeted city centre policing operations are in place.<br\/><br\/>These operations include Operation Pier, which concentrates on the South Quays and Temple Bar area.  This operation includes the designation of certain areas as &quot;hotspots&quot; for anti-social behaviour and regular uniformed and plain clothes patrols.  Other Garda Operations in the city centre include Operation Spire which is focused on the O&rsquo;Connell Street and North Inner City areas, and Operation Stilts which is an ongoing overt policing operation targeting anti-social behaviour and drug-related crime in Dublin city centre locations.<br\/><br\/>Garda&iacute; have increased their activity in targeting the supply of illegal drugs in the area, with increased numbers of drug seizures and searches. According to the provisional statistics from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service for the first nine months of the year, the total number of drug searches has increased by 5% in the North Central\u00a0division and by 24% in the South Central\u00a0division. I also wish to acknowledge the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including work with the entertainment and night-time sector, in seeking to address problems of disorder associated with the abuse of alcohol. Significant Garda resources are being deployed to support this effort, with a dedicated public order patrol van assigned to the city centre every Friday and Saturday night.<br\/><br\/>As a result of these efforts, the\u00a0latest provisional statistics collated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service for the first nine months of the year show a positive trend. Public order offences are down 7% in the South Central\u00a0Garda division and down 19% in the North Central\u00a0division.<br\/><br\/>We should not rely solely on statistics, but neither should we allow high-profile reports of individual incidents to cast our city in an unfairly negative light.  What is most important is the first hand, day-to-day experiences of shoppers, visitors residents and workers, who should feel safe in the city centre at all hours. I acknowledge that challenges remain to be addressed but I am confident that the ongoing efforts of the Garda and others will make a positive difference.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious of the perspectives of business and community interests about the effects of certain types of crime and anti-social behaviour on the environment for business and leisure and on the overall quality of life for residents.Some of the problems faced are linked to disorder associated with abuse of alcohol and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely with a wide range of businesses involved in the entertainment and night-time economy to address these issues so that people can enjoy themselves without concern for their welfare. <br\/><br\/>Other challenges have their origin in even more complex social phenomena which go well beyond the capacity of criminal justice agencies to address on their own.  Dealing with these matters requires a coordinated approach from state agencies involved in social, housing, health and drug treatment services, as well as through partnership with business, community and voluntary groups.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is already a long term partner in a range of local consultative and representative structures in Dublin and elsewhere.  I am considering how we can step up this cooperation with a view to developing collaborative solutions to the range of issues which affect policing and the overall quality of the environment in our urban centres, and I intend to engage further with the Garda authorities in that regard.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the deployment of Garda personnel and Garda operations in tackling crime and anti-social behaviour in Dublin city centre.  From my discussions with the Garda authorities I am assured that Garda management in the Dublin Metropolitan Region keep this deployment under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, including with respect to concerns about public order and anti-social behaviour, so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of policing resources.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will be aware that the first intake since 2009 of 100 new recruits entered training at the Garda College in Templemore on 15th September 2014.

I am assured that when these additional personnel become available the needs of the DMR North and South Central will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.

Approximately 68,000 children are availing of the provision in the current academic year.The free pre-school provision represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;175 million and this funding has been maintained despite the challenging budgetary situation.<br\/><br\/>There is no provision under the ECCE programme to provide for a second free pre-school year for any child.  However, the programme includes a number of additional provisions to take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The Early Years Quality Agenda that is being progressed by my Department,  and which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.<br\/><br\/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,<\/i>the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.

During the course of this Government HIQA&rsquo;s function has been extended to residential services for those with disabilities and child protection services.  In addition, the Department is committed to introducing a regulatory system for home care services, which will be subject to registration and inspection by HIQA, and work on this has already commenced.  <br\/><br\/>The functions of the Minister for Health in relation to HIQA and the Chief Inspector of Social Services are prescribed in the Act and in this respect the Chief Inspector is independent in the exercise of those functions.<br\/><br\/>As regulator, HIQA's remit operates at the level of facilities rather than that of individual complaints, but the requirements at facility level impact very directly on how individual cases are dealt with.<br\/><br\/>Nursing home operators must ensure that all reasonable measures are taken to protect residents from all forms of abuse.  These measures include staff training in relation to the detection and prevention of and responses to abuse.<br\/><br\/>Any incident or allegation of abuse must be investigated and operators must have policies and procedures in place for the prevention, detection and response to abuse.  Furthermore, they must notify HIQA of any allegation of abuse or serious adverse incidents that occur in a nursing home.<br\/><br\/>All nursing homes are required to have an accessible and effective complaints procedure, including an appeals process. They must investigate all complaints promptly, and following investigation put in place any measures required for improvement.  Records of complaints made are required to be kept.  These are available for inspection, thus enabling the HIQA inspector to determine whether the complaints system is sufficiently robust. <br\/><br\/>HIQA takes into account and uses all information received to inform and plan its regulatory activity, and information on individual cases can provide useful pointers in this context.<br\/><br\/>HIQA&rsquo;s programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections helps to ensure that standards are maintained and where issues of non-compliance arise, that these are addressed and rectified.If a nursing home is found not to be in compliance with the Regulations it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. HIQA also has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of registration on nursing homes.<br\/><br\/>My Department, in consultation with both HIQA and the service providers, is working on an ongoing basis to improve and update the requirements that apply to nursing home care. Any request from HIQA for an extension of their remit on the lines suggested by the Deputy will be carefully considered.<br\/><br\/>The aspect of the Deputy's request in relation to complaints investigated by the Health Service Executive has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

The key response is the establishment of an ex-gratia payment scheme, which will cost around &euro;34 million.  In addition, there is a commitment to the continued provision of medical services, including medical cards for the women. The details of the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme are currently being finalised and I expect the Scheme to be launched in the very near future.<br\/><br\/>The decision by Government to implement the Scheme followed Government's examination of a report carried out by Professor Oonagh Walsh, on <i>Practice of Symphysiotomy in Ireland, between 1944 and 1984; <\/i>and<i><\/i>an <i>Independent Review of Issues relating to Symphysiotomy <\/i>by Judge Yvonne Murphy which advised Government, inter alia, on the relative liabilities of insurers, indemnifiers and\/or other parties in relation to symphysiotomy and on the merits and costs of proceeding with a payment scheme relative to allowing the court process to proceed.  <br\/><br\/>Judge Murphy outlined the case for a scheme in her report and her recommendations on levels of awards were accepted by Government.  Subsequently, I asked Judge Murphy to draw up a detailed draft scheme. I have consulted through the summer with the Judge and have also been speaking to relevant parties about the proposed scheme.  Judge Murphy submitted her more detailed proposal to me on 11 September 2014, setting out how the scheme should operate.  <br\/><br\/>In this context I met the support groups representing women who have undergone symphysiotomy on 19 September 2014.  I wanted to hear from the support groups how they hope the scheme will operate, and to confirm to them that the scheme will be established as quickly as possible.Two of the groups (Patient Focus and Survivors of Symphysiotomy Limited) have welcomed the establishment of the scheme. The third group (Survivors of Symphysiotomy) has advised women to reject the scheme. The views of all three groups have been taken into account in devising the scheme and I hope that when the women see the details of the scheme and the efforts made to ensure it is person-centred, simple and non-adversarial many of them will opt to join the scheme.<br\/><br\/>Key aspects of the scheme include:<br\/><br\/>- Women who had a surgical symphysiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990 may apply in accordance with, and subject to the terms of the scheme.<br\/><br\/>- The scheme will be run by an independent Assessor.  If women have questions on any aspect of the scheme, the Assessor or secretariat, will be available to assist.<br\/><br\/>- The scheme will be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial. It will allow women to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application.  It will result in awards of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;150,000 for the women.<br\/><br\/>- Women who have had a surgical symphysiotomy and have medical evidence to prove it may accept an award of &euro;50,000 without further assessment. If no medical records are available a medical assessment will be carried out.<br\/><br\/>- For those who wish to apply for higher awards (&euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000)  a medical assessment may be necessary if  up to date medical records are not available, or if the Assessor decides this is needed for final determination of the award.<br\/><br\/>- Women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a pre-condition to participating in the scheme.  Women may opt out at any stage in application and assessment process, up to the time of accepting their awards.<br\/><br\/>However, on accepting the offer of the award under the scheme, women will have to agree to discontinue their legal proceedings against any party arising out of their symphysiotomy.<br\/><br\/>While I am aware of the comments made by the UN Human Rights Committee, the Government believes that the establishment of this scheme is a fair and appropriate response. In agreeing to the ex-gratia scheme, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to trying to bring a resolution for the women concerned. The Government has acknowledged the pain and suffering which the procedure caused to many of the women and is aware also of  the uphill battle many of them will face in the courts with uncertainty about the outcome of that process.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the numbers of symphysiotomies carried out in the State, Professor Oonagh Walsh, whose report has informed Government about the issue, estimated that around 1,500 symphysiotomies were carried out in hospitals in Ireland in the period between 1944 and 1992.  She noted that it was a rare intervention in comparison with Caesarean section, with a rate of approximately 0.05% of total deliveries, or a symphysiotomy rate of 60 per 100,000 births.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400080#WRBB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1407,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400080#WRBB04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1408,"qnumday":592,"qnumall":"[41003\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400080#WRBB04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Carlow has to wait until July 2015 for hip replacement surgery; the steps he will take to expedite same.","asker":"1102","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1409,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular patient query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly.

The Act provides, inter alia, for the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the enhancement of their high standards of professional education and competencies. The Department of Health is responsible for oversight of the governance of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI). The Department has no role in setting or approving registration fees.<\/p><p>  The Board is an independent body, answerable to the Oireachtas, with the responsibility to ensure that it has the financial capacity to undertake all its legal obligations.  The cost of enacting the additional requirements under the Nurses and Midwives Act 2014 was set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis that was carried out prior to the enactment of the legislation.  These costs include an enhanced regulatory process with supporting systems for continued professional development and certain education and training requirements for the professions.<\/p><p>  It was also made clear at the time of the legislation that the Board would continue to be self-funding and needed to plan and cost how it would fulfil its legal obligations.  Following detailed negotiations with the Executive and Board members in 2013 it was agreed in October 2013 that an initial once-off sum of &euro;1.6m would be granted by the Department to the Board to cover 2013\/2014 costs, but that the Board would have to increase its income in 2015 to undertake its commitments in the legislation.  The Board of the NMBI made the decision to increase the annual registration fee at its meeting on 17 September, 2014.

When GPs refer women under the age of 50 who are deemed to be at high risk of breast cancer they are offered surveillance, as suggested in the HIQA Report on Breast Cancer Surveillance.  That HIQA report outlined the potential benefits of a standardised surveillance programme for women aged less than 50 years who are also at high risk of breast cancer due to a genetic predisposition, or to a strong family history or other factors.  There is no recommendation that well women under the age of 50 are routinely screened for BRCA 1 or 2 mutations.  The National Centre for Medical Genetics (NCMG) in Crumlin Hospital and the NCCP jointly offer assessment and testing of well women who are direct relatives of patients with cancer who have been found to have BRCA 1 or 2 mutations.<\/p><p>  A national hereditary cancer programme has been established by the NCCP, in collaboration with the NCMG, to improve access to assessment and genetic testing for those patients and their families whose cancer may have a hereditary component. The programme focuses on hereditary breast, ovarian and bowel cancer, as well as more rare hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes.  <\/p><p>  Patients can be seen at the NCMG in Crumlin, or at their outreach clinics in Cork and Galway.  Further investment was made by the NCCP and the NCMG with the establishment in 2012 of clinics in St James's and the Mater Hospitals. <\/p><p>  In the first half of 2013, over five hundred cancer patients, or their well relatives, have had genetic testing carried out in relation to their hereditary cancer risk. Approximately the same number of people received a cancer genetics opinion, without requiring genetic testing.  There has been a 56% increase in testing to date this year, jointly funded by the NCMG and NCCP.  Initial diagnostic testing for patients with breast or ovarian cancer is sent to a laboratory in the UK.  Once a specific mutation has been identified, subsequent testing is carried out in Crumlin. <\/p><p>  The NCCP and the NCMG will continue to collaborate via the hereditary cancer programme to ensure genetic testing is carried out in the most cost effective and clinically appropriate manner.  Hereditary Cancer is a priority area for development and a new NCCP consultant post has been approved this year.  Recruitment to that post is in progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400081#WRCC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400081#WRCC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1457,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[41108\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400081#WRCC03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of persons waiting for orthopaedic surgery and, in particular, knee surgery at hospitals (details supplied); and the number of persons waiting for these surgeries between zero and six months, between six months and one year and for periods of over one year","asker":"1190","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1458,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

Once a determination has been made, approved applicants are put on the placement list in order of their approval date and funding issues to applicants in this chronological order to ensure equity nationally. As of the 28th of October 2014 (latest figures available) there were 2,135 people on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme's national placement List with a wait time for funding release of just over 15 weeks. <\/p><p>  The HSE operates the national placement list for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to enable it to operate within budget.  Funding of &euro;939 million is available to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme in 2014. Approximately 515 new approvals for funding are issued each month. However over the course of the year to date, demand for nursing home places has been at approximately  640 per month. The national placement list has grown as a result of this increased demand. The scheme continues to take on new clients within the resources available, in accordance with the legislation.\u00a0 In the first eight months of 2014, 3,928 new clients were funded under the scheme.<\/p><p>  While &euro;23 million was transferred from the Nursing Homes Support Scheme in 2014 to provide additional community services, this was with a view to allowing more older people to be supported in their own homes and communities for longer, and to develop new, more intensive home and community supports for those with higher or more complex needs.  This is in line with both Government policy and with the expressed wishes of older people.  In addition, the HSE allocated &euro;5m in July this year for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.\u00a0 To date this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals who are on the NHSS national placement list and over 200 home care packages to assist patients in the acute hospitals who require a home care package to be discharged. <\/p><p>  A further &euro;25 million has been allocated to tackle the problem of delayed discharges in budget 2015.  This will help with placement list waiting times and the pressure in acute hospitals resulting from beds being taken up by those who no longer require acute care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400082#WRDD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Funding","counter":1491,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400082#WRDD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1492,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[41193\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400082#WRDD01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if senior officials at a hospice (details supplied) are still in receipt of top-up payments; if so, the persons in receipt of them; and the amount they are in receipt of.","asker":"1192","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1493,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.

This was published in the context of an estimate that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 rare diseases whose specificities are a limited number of patients and a scarcity of relevant knowledge and expertise. <\/p><p>  In general, the prospect of initiating a screening programme for rare diseases with ultra-low prevalence rates appear remote. In this vein, it is reported that Gaucher disease occurs in 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 people in the general population. This does not militate though against the HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases - established in the wake of the recommendations of our national plan for rare diseases - weighing the costs, benefits and efficacy of various screening programmes to the general population. Indeed, the national plan declared that the newborn stage is one of the key points in the lifecycle at which the possible presence of a rare disease may be indicated. Newborn screening is now carried out for a total of six conditions. <\/p><p>  The Health Research Board (HRB) is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. It has developed a mechanism whereby it can support excellent research into rare diseases and disorders. This is through a co-funding arrangement with the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCG), an umbrella group of medical research and patient support charities in Ireland. Each year, the MRCG invites proposals for research in diseases and disorders of interest to its members and the HRB manages their evaluation rigorously. This partnership commits over &euro;2 million in funding each year to this scheme.\u00a0In addition, researchers may submit applications for funding for research on rare diseases through any of its other funding schemes. <\/p><p>  The HRB has not received an application for funding for Gaucher Disease. Since 2005 though, \u00a0the HRB has invested almost &euro;4.5 million (current investments of almost &euro;3.2 million) in research on understanding the underlying causes, diagnosis, treatment and management of a number of rare diseases. In addition, the European Commission is working with member states to prepare for the creation of European Reference Networks. These networks may be described as the networking of knowledge and expertise on rare diseases through teams of experts that could also serve as research and knowledge centres. This initiative is important given that countries may not have sufficient local expertise in many rare and ultra-rate diseases. <\/p><p>  Finally, the national plan recommended the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office to, among other things, assist with and support research on rare diseases with various public partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400083#WREE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Palliative Care for Children","counter":1532,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400083#WREE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1533,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[41230\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400083#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will make funds available to increase the number of palliative care units for children; if he will report on the assistance the State gives to Laura Lynn hospice in Leopardstown, Dublin 18; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"954","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1534,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400083#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":1535,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400083#WREE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1536,"qnumday":636,"qnumall":"[41236\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400083#WREE01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the alternative arrangements which are being made for the patients and staff of the St. James's Hospital dental clinic which was suddenly closed recently; and his plans to build or purchase an alternative location.","asker":"1028","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1537,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to investigate this matter and respond to the Deputy as soon as possible.

I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in this regard. If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.<br\/><br\/>However since the publication of both the Review and that of the Leas Cross Commission&rsquo;s Final Report in June 2009 there have been significant developments in the nursing home sector.  <br\/><br\/>The Health Act, 2007 provided for the registration and inspection of all nursing homes &ndash; public, private and voluntary. Independent inspections carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), commenced on 1 July 2009. This system replaced the previous one, under which the HSE registered and inspected private nursing homes only.<br\/><br\/>This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising the Health Act 2007, Registration Regulations (which are currently being reviewed), Care and Welfare Regulations and the<i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The Health Act, 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations, 2013, replaced the 2009 Care &amp;amp; Welfare Regulations. These Regulations contain provisions for the purposes of ensuring proper standards of care for nursing homes and include health care planning, residents&rsquo; rights and protection from abuse.  Operators must arrange comprehensive assessments of the health, personal and social care needs of residents and prepare and individualised care plan based on this assessment.  The Regulations also provide for training and staff development and include requirements for the management and control of operations of nursing homes.<br\/><br\/>The aim of &ldquo;<i>The National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland&rdquo;<\/i>is to ensure that these quality standards are being implemented across the system and that people have confidence in them. The standards are currently being revised and up-dated.<br\/><br\/>Also in 2009 the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was introduced to address the then inequity in the treatment of public and private long-term nursing home residents and to alleviate the financial hardship being experienced by long-term residents in private nursing homes. The scheme supports individuals in need of long-term nursing home care regardless of whether they choose public, private or voluntary nursing homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400084#WRFF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":1579,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400084#WRFF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1580,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[41341\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400084#WRFF00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a medical card review in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 13; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1581,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

It has met four times in recent weeks to coordinate preparedness in the Irish health services and meets regularly to review progress and coordinate the response to any cases in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The EVD Coordination Group has been formed to coordinate preparedness on cross-sectoral issues. It includes representatives from a number of Government Departments and State agencies. The EVD Transport Sub-group has met to coordinate preparedness at ports and airports.<\/p><p>  The HSE Emerging Viral Threats group meets regularly. Most of its work is progressed through the Communications and Training sub groups which are very active.  The HSE has established a cross directorate group to fast track training of front line health care staff and this group is developing a plan to do so. In addition, the Acute Hospitals Directorate has established an Ebola response management group to increase preparedness across all hospitals.  <\/p><p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre continues to provide extensive information for hospital clinicians, general practitioners and other health care workers to enable rapid identification and management of suspected Ebola cases.  Health care workers in the National Isolation Unit and hospitals around the country have received information and advice on identification and management of Ebola patients.  There is also extensive guidance relating to infection prevention and control which clearly describes the steps that staff must take to ensure that they protect themselves and other patients in the event of the presentation of a case or suspected case of Ebola.  Two information sessions on Ebola and relevant guidance have taken place recently with representatives of the National Isolation Unit in attendance to answer queries.  A number of hospitals have held, or are planning shortly to undertake, simulation exercises. This helps to increase preparation levels across hospitals and identify any further training and protocols that may be required. <\/p><p>  The HSE has distributed Personal Protective Equipment packs to GP practices and out of hours services.<\/p><p>  Within the EU, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is coordinating a review of potential Ebola virus treatments.  The EMA recently gave scientific advice to a company developing a vaccine.  Details are provided on the agency's website.<\/p><p>  Ireland, through its delegates from the Health Products Regulatory Authority who participate on the scientific committees at the EMA, is working with experts from across the European Union to continuously assess data as it becomes available.  Together with other regulatory authorities the EMA is advising the World Health Organisation on possible pathways for more rapid development, evaluation and approval of medicines to fight Ebola.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400085#WRGG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":1640,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400085#WRGG01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1641,"qnumday":675,"qnumall":"[41438\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400085#WRGG02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) whose income is below the qualifying threshold was refused the full medical card.

Its report was published on the website of the Department of Health in November 2012, following the Government's decision of 6 November 2012 that the children's hospital would be co-located with St. James's on its campus. <\/p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) has statutory responsibility for the building of the hospital.  Since the decision to locate the hospital at the St. James's campus, the Board has undertaken a range of work including decant planning; site surveys and investigations; design team procurement; and review and update of the Project Brief to take account of the new site.  The Board has also begun pre-application planning consultations.  The Project Brief has now been completed and approved, and a design team has been procured and is working on detailed design development, with the aim of submitting a planning application in June 2015.  Subject to planning, work will commence at the main site at St. James's, and at satellite centre sites at Connolly and Tallaght, in January 2016.  Re-opening the Government's decision on the location of the new hospital at this stage would mean pausing design development, delaying the project, adding to the costs and time involved and leaving children waiting even longer for this new facility.  I do not intend to do this. <\/p><p>  Approximately &euro;39m was spent in the previous phase of this project at the Mater campus.  This expenditure is shown in the Board's 2012 accounts, which have been laid before the Oireachtas.  In 2013, the Board advises it recorded expenditure of the order of &euro;1.7m with a similar amount having been spent in 2014 to date.  Minister Howlin has committed to making &euro;200m available from the sale of the National Lottery for the new children's hospital, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding and underlining the Government's commitment to the project.  Current estimates are that the core hospital, including both satellite centres, will be delivered within this envelope.  This includes provision for inflation, VAT and contingencies; it does not include equipment or ICT which can be purchased, licensed or leased separately.   Philanthropic and commercial funding streams will be targeted as appropriate for supporting elements of the project to include car parking, academic and research facilities, and estimates will be reviewed and refined at each stage of the project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400086#WRHH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":1683,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400086#WRHH01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1684,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[41500\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400086#WRHH01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the case of a person (details supplied) in County Offaly; and when this person may expect an appointment.

However, I understand that the manufacturer of Fampridine supplied the drug free of charge to some patients who were prescribed the drug by their clinician.  The manufacturer has decided to stop supplying the drug free of charge and, as a consequence, these patients are now faced with financing the drug themselves if they wish to continue with this drug treatment.<br\/><br\/>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<br\/><br\/>The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines.<br\/><br\/>In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish health care setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product.  The report is available on the NCPE's website ().<br\/><br\/>On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes.<br\/><br\/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both.  A revised application was received by the HSE on 25th July 2014 and is currently being considered in line with the agreed procedures and timescales.  No further comment is possible at this time as the HSE decision making process is ongoing.<br\/><br\/>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department, and the HSE, fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug.  While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever the price the drug company demands, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the better interests of the health service require that we reimburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400087#WRJJ02600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1757,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400087#WRJJ02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1758,"qnumday":715,"qnumall":"[41623\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400087#WRJJ02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding an application for a medical card in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1759,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The Birth Cohort Follow-Up Report of the All Ireland Traveller Health Study showed that Traveller mothers have a shorter birth gap between pregnancies, and higher parity and stillbirth rates, when compared to the general population.<br\/><br\/>These findings form part of a number of related figures confirming the poor health status of Travellers in comparison to that of the general population, acknowledging that Social Determinants are a major cause of the poor health status of Travellers, with aspects of accommodation, education, employment, poverty, discrimination, lifestyle and access and utilisation of services being cited as key sociodeterminants in this regard. <br\/><br\/>Traveller health continues to be a priority for the HSE and they continue to work in collaboration with the Traveller community with the common goal of improving the health outcomes of this group, including reduction of infant mortality. There are a number of targeted structures and interventions in place to address the disadvantaged status of Travellers and these include:<br\/><br\/>- From a health service perspective, the HSE National Traveller Health Advisory Forum - comprising HSE staff, Traveller Health Unit and Traveller representatives &ndash; is a key body coordinating and driving a series of health related actions aimed at improving the overall health status of Travellers.<br\/><br\/>- The HSE supports improvement in Traveller health through working in partnership with Travellers via Traveller Health Units (THUs) towards addressing priority areas.<br\/><br\/>- In terms of child health, Public Health Nurses and Public Health Specialists work with THUs in relation to any awareness of risk to the community and also provide support around immunisations and development needs of Traveller children.<br\/><br\/>- The development of Traveller Primary Healthcare Programmes whereby Traveller Community Health Workers are employed as liaison staff with their own community is a proven model of good practice.<br\/><br\/>- Peer-led health education and awareness raising programmes among Travellers are key elements of this approach. Examples of particular initiatives aimed at improving child health and reducing mortality include provision of leaflets on Post-Natal Depression and a Galactosaemia awareness leaflet <br\/><br\/>Promoting access to antenatal care is an important area of work for Traveller Community Health Workers, and associated HSE staff, and while there are still concerns that  2.1% of Traveller mothers had no ante-natal care (compared to 0.2% of the general population) the following figures illustrate that there is some of the progress in this area, with:<br\/><br\/>- 22.5% of Traveller mothers now present for the first booking visit to the hospital for antenatal services, this rates is almost the same as the general population (28% at 3 months) and<br\/><br\/>- 81.5% of Traveller mothers share ante-natal care between maternity hospitals and General Practitioners compared to 76.6% of the general population.<br\/><br\/>Continuing to support Traveller mothers to access obstetric services remains a priority action. An example of a Traveller specific intervention here is an antenatal programme through which Traveller Community Health Workers support key messages of antenatal care and link Travellers into local classes through focussed education and appropriate support.<br\/><br\/>Another key initiative in relation to Traveller children that has been successfully developed and delivered includes the Traveller specific Child Safety Awareness Programme - this is a structured programme covering many areas of risk and safety for Traveller parents with the aim of reducing and preventing &lsquo;unintentional injury&rsquo; to children in the 0-5 age group within the home.<br\/><br\/>The goal in <i>Healthy Ireland<\/i>to reduce health inequalities requires not only interventions to target particular health risks but also a focus on addressing these wider social determinants of health. The Framework provides for new arrangements to ensure effective co-operation between the health sector and other areas of Government and public services that are concerned with these broad determinants of health, including those of importance and relevance to all of those persons who experience health inequalities, including Travellers. Empowerment of communities is a particularly relevant principle in respect of supporting members of the Traveller community to response to challenges around their health and health needs. In this context, the new structures established under <i>Healthy Ireland <\/i>to enable and support its implementation will provide a focus on addressing the health needs of all groups experiencing health inequalities, including Travellers, and provides an opportunity to take a new approach to tackling issues such as health inequalities and the social determinants of health more effectively. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400090#WRMM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1909,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400091#WRNN00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1910,"qnumday":772,"qnumall":"[41981\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400091#WRNN00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average processing time for a medical card application in Primary Care Reimbursement Service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1911,"content":"<p>The Primary Care Reimbursement Service has a target to have 90% of properly completed medical\/GP visit card applications processed within 15 days of the application having been received by the HSE.

St James's included a traffic report as part of its overall submission.<\/p><p>  The Group's report was completed in June 2012 and submitted to the Minister for Health.  In identifying the site for the new children's hospital, the Government carefully considered the Dolphin Group's report, along with detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.  Ease of access was one of the issues considered in the planning analysis. <\/p><p>  The Government decided in November 2012 that the new children's hospital should be co-located with St James's on its campus.  While cost, time and access were all considered, the decision was led by clinical considerations.  It is essential that the new children's hospital can deliver best clinical outcomes for children.  Co-location with St James's and, ultimately, tri-location with a maternity hospital on the St James's campus, will provide the excellence in clinical care that our children deserve.

No 328 of 1988) requires pharmacies to maintain a controlled drugs (CD) Register in respect of all drugs listed in Schedule 2, including methadone.  All entries must be recorded in a chronological sequence and in a manner which shows a running balance. <\/p><p>  Inspections are carried out by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland under Section 67 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 to review compliance with the Act, regulations made thereunder and medicines legislation.  The sale and supply of all Schedule 2 controlled drugs and the manner in which the CD Register is maintained are checked as part of these inspections. <\/p><p>  As part of the registration process for retail pharmacy businesses, pharmacy owners and Superintendent Pharmacists are required to notify the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland if the pharmacy concerned is engaged in the sale or supply of methadone. <\/p><p>  As at the 30 November 2012, Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland records indicate that 751 retail pharmacy businesses were engaged in the sale and supply of methadone.

The results show that four pharmacies failed to record or properly record in the CD Register the running balance in respect of one or more Schedule 2 controlled drugs.  In eight cases the physical inventory did not agree with the balance specified in the Registers.  The data obtained during the remaining inspections in 2012 was not recorded on a computer database, and accordingly detailed information regarding regulatory compliance with the requirement to maintain the CD Register is not readily available for the remaining pharmacies. <\/p><p>  At the 31 December 2013, 387 systems inspections were recorded in the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland inspection database.

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). <\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drugs schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This requires consideration of a range of statutory criteria prior to reimbursing any medicine, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.<\/p><p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Nalmefeme (Selincro&reg;) in the GMS and community drugs schemes.  The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with those procedures the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Nalmefeme. <\/p><p>  The Report of the NCPE was published in April 2014.  It estimated that the investment required from the taxpayer to provide access to Nalmefene would be between &euro;6.7m and &euro;12m over the next five years.  The NCPE advice to the HSE also made clear that the introduction of Nalmefene requires the availability of appropriate psychosocial supports.  The availability of those supports is being considered by the Mental Health, Health and Wellbeing and Primary Care divisions of the HSE.<\/p><p>  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  It is appropriate for the HSE prior to committing scare resources to assess whether the required supports are in place and if not, the resources required to put such supports in place, to ensure the appropriate use of this medicine.<\/p><p>  It would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time as the decision making process is ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400092#WROO01300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":1975,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400092#WROO01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1976,"qnumday":797,"qnumall":"[42112\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400092#WROO01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if she will review the case of a person (details supplied) whose medical card was removed and replaced with a GP visit card; and if she will expedite an early decision.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1977,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

The HSE endeavours to ensure that all persons aged 70 and over, who are entitled to a medical card or a GP visit card, are facilitated to avail of their entitlement. <\/p><p>  Under the arrangements effected by the Health Act 2008, a much simplified system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for persons aged 70 or over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. The gross income limits of &euro;500 per week for a single person and &euro;900 per week for a couple from 1 January 2014 are set at more than twice the amount of the State Pension. This arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole. <\/p><p>  In the main, persons in the over-70s age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis. Under the standard  means tested medical card scheme, allowance may be made for rent\/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  Generally, for the over 70s, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel to work related costs.<\/p><p>   Persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs.  This assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and, as outlined,  the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70's gross income thresholds.  <\/p><p>  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.<\/p><p>  There are no current plans to alter the income limits for the over 70's medical card scheme. <\/p><p>  The Government is committed to the introduction of a universal GP service for the entire population in line with the Programme for Government.  As part of the roll out of universal primary care the legislative basis is being advanced in phases.

My Department and the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) monitor the factors that contribute to costs on an ongoing basis.

As part of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, Mr. Pat McLoughlin was appointed as Independent Chair to work with insurance companies, my Department and the HIA to identify effective cost management strategies for the industry.

Loadings can be avoided by taking out health insurance before this date. I am also going to address the sharp price increase that younger people currently experience when they can no longer avail of student discounts.

Recommendations were also made in relation to current apprenticeships. <br\/><br\/>  Following on from the review, an Apprenticeship Implementation Plan was published on the 30th June 2014.  This is available on my Departments website, www.education.ie.<br\/><br\/>  I will shortly be announcing details of the membership of the Council.  The Council will be enterprise led and will have representatives from business, trade unions, and further and higher education bodies.  The first job of work of the new Apprenticeship Council will be to manage a call for proposals from industry for new apprenticeships.  This call for proposals is expected to be made before the end of 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400095#WRRR00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Momentum Programme","counter":2100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400095#WRRR00400"},{"type":"question","counter":2101,"qnumday":843,"qnumall":"[41447\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400095#WRRR00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of persons who have applied for participation in the Momentum programme in each year since its inception; the number of persons approved for participation; the number of persons who completed their course; the annual cost of the scheme; her plans to review its operation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2102,"content":"<p>I understand from SOLAS who manage the Momentum Programme that no data is available on applications or queries to the Momentum programme prior to wait listing; potential participants are referred to the programme by the Department of Social Protection if they are eligible.  12,580 people were waitlisted for the first Momentum programme's projects which ran across 2013 and 2014.  7,656 persons were called to start projects of which 6,574 started.

Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.<br\/><br\/>  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014, which issued to schools in April 2014 and which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.<br\/><br\/>  The Circular also sets out the role which professional reports play in supporting the SNA scheme.  While professional reports play a valuable role in identifying the needs of a child, responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational supports to be provided to schools rests with the National Council for Special Education, in accordance with my Department's policy.<br\/><br\/>  In considering applications for SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. <br\/><br\/>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <br\/><br\/>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<br\/><br\/>  Schools who wish to apply for additional SNA support to support children with care needs in their schools may make such an application to the NCSE.  Schools who wish to appeal the level of SNA allocation which has been made to them may do so via the appeals process which is set out at www.ncse.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400095#WRRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Fees","counter":2106,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400095#WRRR01000"},{"type":"question","counter":2107,"qnumday":845,"qnumall":"[41935\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400095#WRRR01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of Irish citizen applicants who would be affected by amending the residency clause of the free fees initiative.","asker":"977","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2108,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware the Exchequer funds tuition fees costs in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study under my Department's Free Fees Initiative.

However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.<\/p><p>  In developing both of these policy review papers my Department and the NCSE consulted widely with education partners and stakeholders, including parents of children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>  The Circular was developed taking into account the recommendations contained in these policy advice papers and in conjunction with the NCSE, the National Educational Psychological Services and my Department's Inspectorate division.<\/p><p>  Following the publication of the circular, officials at my Department held a series of meetings with stakeholders, including parents of children with special needs, to discuss this Circular with them.<\/p><p>  In order to provide further clarity in relation to the scheme, my Department asked the National Council for Special Education to prepare an Information Booklet for parents in relation to the SNA scheme and it is hoped that this document will be published shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400097#WRTT00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Springboard Programme","counter":2206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400097#WRTT00650"},{"type":"question","counter":2207,"qnumday":880,"qnumall":"[41445\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400097#WRTT00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of persons who have applied for participation in the Springboard programme in each year since its inception; the number of persons approved for participation; the number of persons who completed their course; the annual cost of the scheme; his plans to review its operation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2208,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the spreadsheet. <br\/><br\/>The Higher Education Authority (HEA), which is managing Springboard on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, monitors and evaluates the outcomes of the Springboard programme on an ongoing basis.<br\/><br\/>A recent Trend Analysis on Springboard 2011 to 2013 compiled by the HEA shows that 52% of Springboard 2012-2013 graduates were in employment or self-employment with 6 months of completing their course.

The first priority of both the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Justice and Equality has been to find a reasonable accommodation for genuine students affected by those closures. This accommodation must have regard to the fact that these colleges were private bodies with no relationship to the State. The Department of Justice and Equality acted rapidly to bring reassurance to students regarding their immigration status.<\/p><p>  On 21 May 2014 the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Justice and Equality announced the establishment of a Task Force on Students Affected by the Closure of Private Colleges.  The Task Force worked closely with the representative bodies of the high-quality private sector providers to develop solutions that could provide reasonable accommodation for students impacted by the closures who were not covered by learner protection arrangements.<\/p><p>  The Report of the Task Force, which I published together with the Minister for Justice and Equality on 2 September, sets out the arrangements for reasonable accommodation which have been put in place by the high-quality private sector English language and higher education colleges. Those arrangements allow affected students the opportunity to take up an alternative arrangement at significantly discounted rates. In addition to those arrangements, the Task Force also established a website, www.studenttaskforce.ie, which sets out relevant information for students.<\/p><p>  In addition, we also announced robust regulatory reforms of the international education sector on that date. The purpose of those reforms is to protect the consumer and educational interests of genuine international students, to tackle abuse of the labour market and the immigration regime, and to safeguard the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers.<\/p><p>  Those reforms have three main pillars &ndash; (i) a new list of eligible programmes, (ii) an enhanced inspection and compliance regime and (iii) changes to the operation of the work concession. It is expected that these reforms will significantly enhance the overall quality of Ireland's international education offering, reduce the risk to our reputation from the activities of lower quality operators and enhance the net benefits of internationalisation to the labour market and wider economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400097#WRTT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Contractors","counter":2222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400097#WRTT01750"},{"type":"question","counter":2223,"qnumday":885,"qnumall":"[41470\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400097#WRTT01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the contractors administration services are required to give advance notice of a visit to a construction site; if so, her views that this undermines their efforts to investigate questions non-compliance on school building projects; if she will consider authorising CAS to make site visits without prior notification; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This figure was down from 35% in the 2009 survey.  <br\/><br\/>  It is not my intention to legislate on this issue. In the first instance, as  Minister for Education and Skills I do not have the authority to dictate to  schools in this manner. Schools are generally privately managed institutions  which, although largely funded by the State, are relatively autonomous. <br\/><br\/>  The education system provides students with appropriate knowledge and skills in  relation to issues such as healthy eating, the importance of a balanced diet  and an active lifestyle. This is done through Social, Personal and Health  Education, Home Economics and Physical Education. We want to ensure that  schools offer students healthy alternatives so that can they put their  knowledge into practice and choose in an informed way.  <br\/><br\/>  It is my intention to issue guidance to schools on promoting well-being among  their students. The promotion of 'healthy vending' will form part of this  guidance. The guidance is being developed in consultation with the Department  of Health and the HSE. <br\/><br\/>  It is not just about getting rid of junk food but it requires us to look at the  totality of the health and well-being of our young people.

The majority of primary schools  receive grant assistance to provide for secretarial (and\/or caretaking)  services under the Ancillary Services Capitation Grant for Primary Schools.  Within the Capitation grant scheme, the level and extent of services provided  is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded  under the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services as  resources permit. <br\/><br\/>  My Department does not stipulate any rules concerning how secretarial services  are to be obtained by the school.  It is a matter for the individual school to  decide how best to apply the funding to suit the school's particular needs.Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such  staff are employees of individual schools and my Department therefore does not  have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are  engaged.

and if this is the case, his views that this is appropriate.","asker":"1034","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2401,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is currently considering potential revisions to the system of allocating Resource Teaching and Learning Support to schools. This is on foot of recommendations set out in the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on &quot;Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools (May 2013) and the recommendations of the NCSE Working Group Report &quot;A Proposed New Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs&quot;. <br\/><br\/>Following the publication of these reports, my Department advised that it would commence the process of gathering information which would be required to develop the proposed new model, to allow its impact to be assessed, and to assess if, and from when, the model could be implemented.  Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.<br\/><br\/>The working group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have. The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders. <br\/><br\/>The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioral disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders. <br\/><br\/>Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration of a schools social context should form part of any proposed new resource allocation model.<br\/><br\/>Pending the availability of a more objective source of information, the working group stated that it was confident that survey reporting by school principals could produce robust up to date data on school context in a similar manner to DEIS and earlier initiatives. <br\/><br\/>The Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<br\/><br\/>Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school. <br\/><br\/>At all stages of the development of the advice and in particular in the work of the working group there was comprehensive consultation with education partners and stakeholders and through this consultation there was awareness and broad support for the proposed approach including the deployment of a survey. <br\/><br\/>The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data. Schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.<br\/><br\/>Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire. I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<br\/><br\/>Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to the Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400101#WRXX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":2402,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400101#WRXX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2403,"qnumday":951,"qnumall":"[42137\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400101#WRXX00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"under the new profiling currently being undertaken for the provision of additional resources, if greater weighting is to be given to schools with pupils who are EAL, English as an additional language, over schools whose pupils are GAL, Gaeilge as an additional language; and her views on the fairness on this when similar difficulties present in both circumstances.","asker":"1034","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":2404,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published its Report on a Proposed New Model for Allocating Teachers for Students with Special Educational Needs on 18th June 2014.<br\/><br\/>The NCSE, consulted widely with education partners, representatives of the disability sector, stakeholders and parent representative groups, during the course of the development of this policy advice.<br\/><br\/>The report recommends that a new allocation model should be developed, based on a schools educational profile, while providing a baseline allocation to every mainstream school to support inclusion. <br\/><br\/>The report recommends that in developing educational profile of a school that account would be taken of:<br\/><br\/>The number of students with complex special educational needs in a school.

The function of the body is to utilise the cash contributions of up to &euro;110m pledged by religious congregations to support the needs of persons who, as children, experienced abuse in residential institutions in Ireland and have received settlements from the Residential Institutions Redress Board or Court awards.

SOLAS was established on 27 October 2013 and funded for the remainder of the year from the residual FAS budget.  The proposed budget for SOLAS in 2014 is &euro;640.445 million.The majority of this funding is paid out to the Education and Training Boards by way of grants to fund the delivery of further education and training.There are currently 13 members of the board of SOLAS.<br\/><br\/>Under the Public Service Reform plan a number of bodies were merged as follows.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences were merged in March 2012 to form the Irish Research Council (IRC). The IRC has been established as a sub-board of the Higher Education Authority (HEA). Its function is to award research funding, primarily for postgraduate students and early-career postdoctoral researchers.  The establishment of the IRC will result in an estimated saving of &euro;100,000 on an annual basis. There are currently 12 members of the board of the IRC.<br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education Training Awards Council (FETAC) were amalgamated to form a new agency, the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  QQI's functions are set out in Section 9 of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act, 2012. These include the development of awards and standards, review of education and training providers, development of quality assurance, validation of programmes, maintenance of the National Framework of Qualifications and facilitation of qualification recognition.The estimated saving following the merger is &euro;1 million on annual basis. There are currently 10 members of the board of QQI. <br\/><br\/>Under the provisions of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013, 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) have replaced 33 Vocational Education Committees (VECs). The functions of ETBs are set out in Section 10 of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013. ETBs provide second-level education in 254 post primary schools and are the main providers of adult and community education. 11 of the boards provide training directly through former F&Aacute;S centres. They also deliver education in prisons, children detention schools and certain facilities maintained by the HSE. ETBs also provide youth work services under the auspices of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Following re-configuration of the VECs, full year savings are estimated at &euro;2.1m. Further savings are likely to be achieved through the realisation of economies of scale arising from the mergers and the wider Education and Training Sector Reform Programme.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water is responsible for the provision of water services and that it shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, the CER, which has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers of Irish Water.<br\/><br\/>In advance of the introduction of domestic water charges, the Government made certain decisions on 6 May 2014 relating to the structure of water charges including, inter alia, a free allowance per household and an additional free allowance for children on the same qualifying conditions as the Child Benefit payment from the Department of Social Protection. <br\/><br\/>As these allowances are to be funded by Government, Irish Water needs to ensure it has the appropriate and sufficient information to reflect these entitlements. Irish Water is a specified body under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 20 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2014, and is therefore permitted to request Personal Public Services (PPS) numbers to authenticate the identity of a person being provided with an allowance.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water will treat applicants&rsquo; personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. In complying with these Acts, Irish Water must ensure that the data is only used for the purpose for which it was collected and must also ensure that any data collected is stored securely. The collection of PPS numbers allows Irish Water to confirm and validate the entitlement to allowances for each customer. This information will not be shared with any organisation other than the Department of Social Protection for the purpose of verification, to ensure that each household receives the allowances it is entitled to, be it the free allowance per household or any additional allowance for children at that address. It will also allow Irish Water to provide lower charges to owners who have unoccupied dwellings. I understand that Irish Water and the Department of Social Protection are developing arrangements governing the sharing of PPS information. Any such arrangements will be subject to data protection requirements. <br\/><br\/>With charges effective from 1 October 2014 Irish Water is in the process of compiling the relevant data to ensure that customers can be billed accurately based on the tariff structure approved by the CER. Irish Water has sent application packs to approximately 2 million households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015. The application process will enable customers to confirm their details for billing and, by providing the relevant PPS numbers, claim the allowances that they are eligible for. <br\/><br\/>The CER has made a determination on th e water charges plan submitted to it by Irish Water, which sets out the position if customers do not validate their details. In these circumstances, a default unmetered charge of &euro;424 per annum will apply, which does not include the free allowances. The relevant details of the determination are available on theCER website (). <br\/><br\/>Irish Water has an on - going engagement with the Office of the Data Protection Commission (DPC) and has advised my Department that it has been asked to provide clarity on some aspects of the legal language of its data protection notice as published on its website, .It has confirmed that this notice was, and is, fully compliant with data protection requirements. However, by providing additional clarity, it will re-assure customers that data is held securely, used properly and not shared with third parties, except where some minimal information needs to be provided in the context of the delivery of water services such as contractors repairing leaks.Any advice given to Irish Water from the DPC will be further incorporated into its data protection notice. <br\/><br\/>Irish Water has confirmed that its systems have undergone extensive independent quality assurance testing. In addition, the DPC has worked closely with Irish Water to agree the process for the capture, storage and usage of customer data.

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281m over that period.\u00a0 It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47m pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015. <br\/><br\/>The SICAP is one of my key priorities and its overall indicative budget for 2015 has been maintained close to 2014 levels. The Programme&rsquo;s target groups are:<br\/><br\/>-  Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas<br\/><br\/>-  Lone Parents<br\/><br\/>-  New Communities (including Refugees\/Asylum Seekers)<br\/><br\/>-  People living in Disadvantaged Communities<br\/><br\/>-  People with Disabilities<br\/><br\/>-  Roma<br\/><br\/>-  The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register)<br\/><br\/>-  Travellers<br\/><br\/>-  Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas<br\/><br\/>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently under way.\u00a0 Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed. Stage two (Invitation to Tender), got underway on 20 October and involves the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, in local authority areas, to deliver the programme. Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br\/><br\/>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme. In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications.  That said, I understand that some small groups, such as the groups under the remit of the NCCWN, faced a number of challenges in competing in the Stage one process. The results of Stage one were released on 24 September 2014 and I can confirm that none of the NCCWN groups expressed an interest either as lead applicants or as part of a consortium.<br\/><br\/>I am now considering the implications of that for NCCWN and will conclude that consideration as soon as possible. In the meantime, LCDP funding will be provided to NCCWN up to end March 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400102#WRYY04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Administration","counter":2499,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2500,"qnumday":982,"qnumall":"[41008\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ00200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number and the percentage of that number of application packs issued by Irish Water that have been returned properly completed.","asker":"1197","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":2501,"qnumday":983,"qnumall":"[41009\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number and the percentage of that number of application packs issued by Irish Water that have been returned uncompleted.","asker":"1197","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":2502,"qnumday":984,"qnumall":"[41010\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ00400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if Irish Water issued any request to An Post regarding the way to deal with Irish Water application packs that are being returned unopened to Irish Water.","asker":"1197","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":2503,"qnumday":1026,"qnumall":"[41555\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of Irish Water application packs that were returned to sender; if Irish Water has identified the number due to incorrect names, addresses or other information; if Irish Water has destroyed returned post that was marked return to sender; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"954","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2504,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 982 to 984, inclusive, and 1026 together.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has sent application packs to approximately 2 million households, which refer to the effective charging date and the fact that billing for domestic customers in receipt of public water services will start in January 2015.\u00a0 Irish Water has informed my Department that as of 31 October 2014, it had received some 811,000 responses and approximately 77% of these responses were to confirm as customers of Irish Water.

Our public water infrastructure is deficient and inadequate as a consequence of decades of under-investment and the lack of a truly, national approach that could maximise the impact of investment.  An Independent Assessment published in 2012 reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of the delivery of water services through 34 local authorities, and concluded that there was a fragmentation of leadership and co-ordination, difficulty in attaining economies of scale, difficulty in delivering projects of national importance and an aging and poor quality network. The report concluded that the best way of ensuring increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and capital investment and accessing new finances for the water sector, was to establish Irish Water as a public utility.   <\/p><p>  This was implemented through the Water Services Act 2013, which provided for the establishment of Irish Water, and the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 which provided for the transfer of responsibility for water services provision from the local authorities to Irish Water. The transfer of responsibility took effect on 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  The Independent Assessment also pointed to the particular strengths of the local authority system in relation to locally based teams, and this positive aspect is preserved through the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) put in place between Irish Water and local authorities which garner the knowledge and expertise of local authority staff combined with the network and utility management experience available to Irish Water, to provide for a more consistent and efficient service for customers.   <\/p><p>  Since its establishment, Irish Water has implemented key systems to provide for a more strategic approach to managing water services assets and underpinning priority investment. Capital investment in core infrastructure over the period ahead will be substantially more than in 2013 and operational savings of some &euro;12 million have already been achieved in 2014 through a national approach to procurement. <\/p><p>  Irish Water, like other utilities, will have the capacity to fund investment without adding to the Government Debt. It would not be possible to fund the same level of investment if the responsibility for water services had remained with local authorities. The independent regulation of the sector, by the Commission for Energy Regulation, will ensure that operational efficiency is achieved across the sector, in Irish Water&rsquo;s central services and in the Service Level Agreements. This will take account of international benchmarks and will be focused on ensuring that customers are only charged for an efficient service. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Septic Tank Inspections","counter":2522,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ01850"},{"type":"question","counter":2523,"qnumday":991,"qnumall":"[41081\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ01900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if it is a local authority requirement to inspect a septic tank where the individual householder reports that their septic tank is malfunctioning and likely to cause a risk to the environment and\/or human health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":2524,"qnumday":992,"qnumall":"[41082\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to extend the septic tank grant scheme for the carrying out of remediation, repair or upgrading works to, or replacement of, a domestic waste water treatment system, where the need for such remediation, repair, upgrading or replacement has been identified by a householder themselves; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1070","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2525,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 991 and 992 together.<br\/><br\/>Local authorities carry out inspections of septic tanks and similar systems for a variety of reasons, including water quality issues at drinking water sources or within designated shellfish or bathing water catchments and arising from reports of pollution from members of the public.

As a tool to assist with this, a Resource Allocation Model (RAM) has been developed. In order to achieve the objective of moving towards allocating resources according to this model, the Department has in recent years worked to ensure that funding for those areas which this RAM shows have greatest needs are protected, where possible, and thus move towards achieving a fairer share of resources. In deciding on funding allocations for SICAP, this principle was used. While, overall , the SICAP allocations were lower in some instances than those for LCDP, Meath was protected from this reduction. The RAM , underpinned by the Pobal\/HAASE Deprivation Index, which is used in relation to allocations, allows funds to be allocated in a manner which means that a disadvantaged person in any area of the country will have equality of resources available to their areas to support their needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Funding","counter":2538,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ02950"},{"type":"question","counter":2539,"qnumday":997,"qnumall":"[41161\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400103#WRZZ03000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1562 of 17 September 2014, the projected revenue that will be raised by Irish Water in 2015 based on the finalised charging structure from the Commission for Energy Regulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":2540,"content":"<p>Domestic water charges commenced with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015.

The primary purpose of the Scheme was to assist in the unwinding of loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme. Applications to the value of some &euro;164 million in loans have been accepted into the Scheme.<br\/><br\/>The figure of &euro;164m includes &euro;111m in respect of loans which were fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the Scheme. The remaining loans of &euro;53m accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme are in the form of annuity loans, for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency. Such annuity repayments are recoupable from my Department subject to the local authority complying with terms of the Scheme. <br\/><br\/>In 2013 as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources, and following a review of the Scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the Land Aggregation Scheme, in terms of accepting new applications into the Scheme, was no longer a sustainable option. The review concluded with the issuance of Circular 35\/2013 on 11 December 2013, notifying local authorities of the discontinuance of the Scheme in respect of new applications.<br\/><br\/>Following the discontinuance of the Scheme, local authorities have been advised to consult with the Housing Finance Agency directly on the management of loans relating to lands not accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme.

Under the IBRC Act the Special Liquidators are obliged to independently value all the assets of IBRC and to engage in a sales process which will maximise the return for its creditors, including the State. The matter of Development Bonds issued by the Bank is one of a number of important issues that the Special Liquidators must consider in exercising their statutory duties under the Act.  Development bonds have traditionally been required as a condition of planning permission by local authorities. The developer must provide a bond, set out as a planning condition, which is then called upon in the event that the developer does not complete their development in accordance with the plans and particulars, the conditions of planning and relevant codes and regulations.<\/p><p>  The IBRC had, in the past, issued bonds to local authorities in relation to loans outstanding to the institution.\u00a0 It should be noted that it is most likely that any liabilities which may arise in relation to any bonds\/guarantees\/indemnities under these arrangements will rank as unsecured claims in the special liquidation.

In 2013, international consultants Tourism Development International (TDI) completed the most comprehensive study ever undertaken on angling in Ireland, identifying its economic value at &euro;755 million, including &euro;282 million from angling tourism, and supporting 10,000 jobs in rural and peripheral communities.<\/p><p>  IFI was instrumental in bringing the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) annual meeting to Ireland in 2013 and working on investment and promotion with Angling Representative Bodies, other State Agencies and local communities continues to bring international angling events to these shores with significant economic dividends for the hosting communities. This year investment supported by IFI in the Greenway facilities at Coachford, County Cork saw the now world class venue host the World Feeder Fishing Championships attracting almost 200 competitors and officials from 25 nations. The event attracted large numbers of spectators and an almost &euro;2m economic dividend for the surrounding area.<\/p><p>  IFI also works collaboratively with the Department of Culture Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland and the cross border Loughs Agency on promoting the island of Ireland as a world class angling venue for overseas visitors.<\/p><p>  Ireland faces stiff competition for international angling visitors and participation at conferences, trade shows and exhibitions is an important element in IFI&rsquo;s promotion and development strategy. I am advised that the Chief Executive Officer and the Business Development Director of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), therefore, attended the World Recreational Fishing Conference in Sao Paulo, from 1 to 4 September 2014. With workshops and other activities taking place simultaneously throughout the 4 day conference more than one attendee is required to realise full value from attendance. The conference is attended by fisheries managers, economists, ecologists, scientists and other service providers from all around the world and takes place every 3 years. It provides a highly valuable forum for professionals and institutions representing all components of the recreational fishing sector to exchange ideas and new knowledge relating to the science, management and promotion of recreational fisheries.<\/p><p>  Attendance at events and conferences relevant to the remit of any State Agency is a day to day operational matter for the Agency itself, but I am advised IFI considers that the conference is highly relevant to fisheries managers in Ireland and attendance is an investment in the future of recreational angling management.

This assessment was essential to provide critical information on the nature and extent of the infestation at Lanesborough to inform the consideration of further actions. However, it is important that all understand that Asian Clam, like many other aquatic invasive species, is extremely pervasive in the environment, and once in a water body it is likely that operations will be focused on managing the infestation rather than eradication.<br\/><br\/>  As Deputies may be aware IFI does not have a statutory remit as regards alien invasive species but, nevertheless, is coordinating a comprehensive cross agency response to the infestation. Responding to this infestation will require co-ordinated action from a number of State agencies and IFI has been facilitating and chairing meetings of relevant Agencies since the 19th of September.<br\/><br\/>  Informed by the results of the recent scientific survey, IFI coordinated the latest meeting on the 29th of October involving Waterways Ireland, IFI, the ESB, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Bord Na Mona and Longford and Roscommon County Councils, at which a method statement for removal works was submitted by Waterways Ireland. This statement is being considered by the relevant agencies, including Statutory regulatory bodies. In the first instance it is anticipated that a trail dredge will take place in advance of a full scale dredging operation. In advance of this an EPA licence will be required for disposal of the dredged material and the classification of the materials will have a bearing on the method and cost of disposal.<br\/><br\/>  At this point I understand that the overall cost of a full scale dredging operation has yet to be established, however, this will become clear once the material classification is available and it will be possible to accurately estimate the cost.<br\/><br\/>  IFI and the other Agencies are committed to collaborative efforts to address the infestation at Lanesborough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400108#WREEE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","counter":2759,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400108#WREEE02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2760,"qnumday":1084,"qnumall":"[41424\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400108#WREEE02600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"to set out his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding the introduction of a new post code system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":2761,"content":"<p>My Department commenced a procurement process for a National Postcode System in 2011. An open and competitive procurement process was conducted in accordance with Department of Finance and EU procurement frameworks. A pre-qualification questionnaire was issued on on 17 January 2011. This invited interested parties to tender for the contract as a postcode management licence holder for a period of 10 years to design, provide, disseminate and maintain a National Postcode System. The choice of postcode operator was restricted to those companies who participated in the procurement process - this did not include the company Loc 8 Code as they did not enter the process.<br\/><br\/>On 8 October 2013, the Government approved the appointment of Capita Business Support Services Ireland Limited as the company which will develop, roll-out and operate the National Postcode System.<br\/><br\/>During the tender process for the project, the consultants retained by the Department evaluated a range of options for the postcode structure, including the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee. After detailed consideration an approach using a unique identifier was recommended to Government and the postcode design and brand &lsquo;Eircode&rsquo; was approved by Government in April this year.<br\/><br\/>There has been widespread support from both public sector bodies and private businesses with particular interest from the retail and financial industries for the introduction of postcodes nationally. In addition, the emergency services see the introduction of postcodes as facilitating the speedier deployment of their services. An Post, who were actively involved in the design process, and who are fully committed to using Eircodes, are currently updating their mail sortation systems to fully integrate with Eircodes. Eircodes will facilitate improved efficiencies and quality improvements in the mails sector and provide a stimulus to mail volumes through improved marketing capabilities. The consortium developing the system has also undertaken a significant programme of business engagement with both private and public stakeholders. The unique identifier will be particularly useful in identifying the 35% of addresses in Ireland which are non-unique.<br\/><br\/>Concerns have been expressed by a number of logistics bodies in connection with the Eircode, most specifically in relation to the non-sequential nature of Eircodes.

Under the European Union (Energy Efficiency Regulations) 2014 the roll-out of smart meters is a function of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The CER, as the competent authority for the rollout of smart meters, evaluates the benefits and costs of the programme at all key stages. The first of these evaluations involved a major programme of technology and user trials and showed that a national rollout of smart meters would be likely to lead to overall reductions in electricity and gas consumption and a reduction in peak-time electricity consumption of over 8%. This first cost benefit analysis (CBA) carried out by the ESRI and Frontier Economics estimated a positive net present value (NPV) of &euro;225 million. The most recent CBA, by PWC, showed a central negative NPV of &euro;54 million. However, based on the scale of overall NSMP expenditures, as well as the significant uncertainty which still attaches to certain of the most significant assumptions of cost, PWC indicated that the result should be interpreted as broadly neutral. On this basis, CER consider that the CBA supports the continuation of the programme into the detailed design phase.

However, before that suggestion is advanced any further, I wish to take some time to review the position to ensure that any such change is warranted at all but in particular to ensure that any modification to the display of text on our road signs will not compromise\u00a0road safety in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400109#WRFFF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Policy","counter":2820,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400109#WRFFF03650"},{"type":"question","counter":2821,"qnumday":1105,"qnumall":"[41153\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400109#WRFFF03700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans or proposals to overcome the traditional under-representation in the midlands area, particularly in Longford and Westmeath, in relation to Irish tourism activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":2822,"content":"<p>The matter raised is\u00a0for the board and management of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.\u00a0 I have referred the Deputy's question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for direct reply.<br\/><br\/>Please contact my private office if a reply is not received within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400109#WRFFF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus &Eacute;ireann Services","counter":2823,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400109#WRFFF03850"},{"type":"question","counter":2824,"qnumday":1106,"qnumall":"[41177\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400109#WRFFF03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has not been awarded the Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicle recovery and towing service contract.","asker":"1070","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":2825,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the company for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400109#WRFFF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":2826,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400109#WRFFF04050"},{"type":"question","counter":2827,"qnumday":1107,"qnumall":"[41184\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400109#WRFFF04100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the inconvenience caused to hauliers and drivers operating trucks on motorways, national primary and national secondary routes because of the lack of lay-bys and toilet facilities (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1007"},{"type":"speech","counter":2828,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.

Payments of &euro;1,521 in respect of Year 3 of 15 (2014) are currently being processed for the applicant and a number of other applicants in similar circumstances.  Following a request made to my Department, a scientific review of the site, in which the applicant has an interest, was undertaken to explore the possibility that turf extraction could continue in certain areas while also allowing for the conservation of the raised bog habitat within the site. The results of this review have determined that turf cutting can be consented to in certain areas of the site but cannot be permitted in other parts. The site is quite unusual as a raised bog special area of conservation and the particular hydrological context allows for limited turf extraction while not compromising the conservation of the threatened habitat on the site. This is exceptional and is not the case with most other special areas of conservation. <\/p><p>  My Department is considering the implications of this review for applicants such as the one referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question and will be in contact with such applicants in due course. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400112#WRJJJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Promotion","counter":2947,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400112#WRJJJ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2948,"qnumday":1150,"qnumall":"[42035\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400112#WRJJJ02000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of Irish language feature films the Irish Film Board funded over the past 20 years; the level of funding to each individual project; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":2949,"content":"<p>Providing historical information over a 20-year period requires significant time and staff resources to check and collate.

A further reply with the balance of the requested information will issue directly to the Deputy in due course.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Film Board has provided funding for ten Irish language feature length projects between 2007 and 2013 &ndash; five fiction features films and five feature film documentaries. Kings and An Brontannas were both put forward as the Irish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category for the Academy Awards in the year that they were produced. <br\/><br\/>The Irish Film board has also provided support for a number of TV series with the aim to develop creative talent in the area of Irish language narrative fiction. Television drama plays a vital role in the continuing development of Irish language writers, directors and producers for film.<br\/><br\/>In terms of developing less established Irish language filmmakers, the Irish Film board also provides funding for Gearrscann&aacute;in - a specific Irish language short film fund, which funds up to two short films every year and often highlights the wide range of established and popular Irish actors who are fluent in the Irish language. The IFB works in partnership with the Irish Film Institute to ensure that the Gearrscann&aacute;in Irish language short films are used widely in schools as a teaching aid for the Irish language, a study guide is produced and distributed to schools for the Irish language shorts every year.<br\/><br\/>I should add that, in recent years, the information sought by the Deputy is published in the Annual Report of the Irish Film Board and is available on its website at .<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Title<\/th><th>Category<\/th><th>Production<\/th><th>Development<\/th><th>Distribution<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>Kings<\/td><td>Feature Film<\/td><td>760,000<\/td><td>20,000<\/td><td>38,917<\/td><td>818,917<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>Corp &amp;amp; Anam<\/td><td>TV Series<\/td><td>300,000 <\/td><td>46,578 <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>346,578 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>Na Cloigne<\/td><td>Feature Films<\/td><td>500,000 <\/td><td>- <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>500,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>An Brontannas<\/td><td>Feature Film &amp;amp; TV<\/td><td>360,000 <\/td><td>40,000 <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>400,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Olagon<\/td><td>Feature Film<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>19,000 <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>19,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Klondike<\/td><td>TV Series<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>10,000 <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>10,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Maamtrasna<\/td><td>Feature Film<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>15,500 <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>15,500 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>A Song of Granite<\/td><td>Feature Film<\/td><td>- <\/td><td>44,000 <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>44,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total Feature Film <\/td><td><\/td><td>1,920,000 <\/td><td>195,078 <\/td><td>38,917 <\/td><td>2,153,995 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Documentaries<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>A Boatload of Wild Irishmen<\/td><td>Feature Documentary<\/td><td>50,000 <\/td><td>- <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>50,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>An Paiste Beo Bocht<\/td><td>Feature Documentary<\/td><td>51,202 <\/td><td>- <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>51,202 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>Aosdana<\/td><td>Feature Documentary<\/td><td>70,000 <\/td><td>- <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>70,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>L&oacute;n sa Sp&eacute;ir (Men at Lunch)<\/td><td>Feature Documentary<\/td><td>50,000 <\/td><td>15,000 <\/td><td>14,150 <\/td><td>79,150 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>Neal McGregor<\/td><td>Feature Documentary<\/td><td>40,000 <\/td><td>15,000 <\/td><td> - <\/td><td>55,000 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Total Feature Docs<\/td><td><\/td><td>261,202 <\/td><td>30,000 <\/td><td>14,150 <\/td><td>305,352 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>Overall Total<\/td><td><\/td><td>2,181,202 <\/td><td>225,078 <\/td><td>53,067 <\/td><td>2,459,347 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400112#WRJJJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme Expenditure","counter":2950,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400112#WRJJJ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2951,"qnumday":1151,"qnumall":"[42088\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014110400112#WRJJJ02200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the level of drawdown of funds under the built heritage scheme by county; and if it is intended to hold a new round of the scheme.","asker":"1110","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":2952,"content":"<p>In 2014, my Department was provided with a once-off allocation of &euro;5m Capital Stimulus funding for a new Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme to assist with works to safeguard protected structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000 - 2012.
