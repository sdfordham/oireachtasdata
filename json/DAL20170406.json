That conversation was had in the middle of all of the controversy surrounding the departure of the former Commissioner, Martin Callinan.  The State was involved in one case in particular and the Attorney General wanted to brief the Taoiseach personally at the time without the Minister for Justice and Equality being present.  The Garda taping allegations went back over the previous 30 years.  What was reported in 2014 appeared to be a serious infringement of the privacy rights of citizens, a right we all value and assume is respected by the State.  The Attorney General gave instructions to all Garda stations not to destroy any tapes.  The Taoiseach informed the House of that particular serious development after the Cabinet discussed it and confirmed that Mr. Justice Fennelly was to be appointed to examine that and other issues.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il he thought this was a matter of very considerable concern in the sense of having confidence, public accountability and trust in the justice system.  For that reason, he advised the Attorney General that all the facts, both of the individual case and the wider trawl, should be assessed by somebody competent in the legal profession to see how serious the issue was.  The newspapers say that Mr. Justice Fennelly's second report is being published today.  It is meant to be 740 pages long and was delivered to the Department of An Taoiseach and the Attorney General's office last Friday so they have had it for six days.  It seems exceptionally convenient that this report is being published when the Taoiseach is due to be in Germany today and will be unavailable to answer any questions in this House or from the media this afternoon, as there is no provision for questions at the press conference in Germany.  That seems quite bizarre and similar to the likes of North Korea.  Perhaps in the context of every other scandal the Government is presiding over, the Taoiseach has become desensitised to issues of this nature.  Perhaps he does not think it is that big of a deal.  Everything should be taken in context.  In the context of the Bus &Eacute;ireann strike, the Charleton tribunal, a struggling Garda Commissioner whom the Government continues to support, a homelessness crisis, a housing crisis, a health service crisis - I could go on - the meeting with Angela Merkel is probably a welcome break.<\/p>  <p>  Despite all of that, the Fennelly report and its contents are of huge importance to this House and to the public.  Simply because the Taoiseach has decided to publish the report when he is conveniently out of the country at a meeting that apparently could not be changed does not mean he will get away from answering questions in this House on that matter.  The report is on his desk since last Friday and today's meeting with Angela Merkel was presumably in the calendar for some time.  The public can make up their own minds as to why An Taoiseach chose today to publish such a serious and damning report.  My question to the Minister is whether he has seen a copy of the report.  Could he confirm when the report will be published?  Could he also confirm whether a press conference will be held, and when, and whether the Minister for Justice and Equality will appear in this Chamber to answer questions before the House?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600003#A00600","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1491476700,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Chambers for observing the time limits and I ask all other Deputies to observe them also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600004#B00100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491476700,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The second report of the Fennelly commission was received by the Taoiseach last Friday evening and it was then furnished to the Attorney General.

The report recommends the abolition of water charges, the scrapping of domestic metering, including for new builds, and provision for a referendum to retain our water infrastructure in public ownership.<\/p><p>This represents a massive and deserved victory for all those people from communities throughout Ireland who campaigned and resisted the imposition of charges, and who fought against the push to privatise our water services.  The right to water movement has endured and has prevailed against great odds.  The Minister knows that the majority of Deputies elected to this D&aacute;il were elected on an anti-water charges platform.<\/p> <p> If the sights and sounds of thousands of people marching time and again in protest was not enough for the Minister's party to grasp the level of public opposition to water charges, then surely the democratic vote at a general election should have been.  Of course it was not.  It fell on the closed ears of a Fine Gael-led Government.  The Minister's Government turned its face against the express will of the people and it stopped the D&aacute;il from dealing with the matter of water charges.  His ministerial colleague and superhero friend, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, pushed this politically charged issue of water charges into a new committee.  He set it up.  It was his process as well as the Minister, Deputy Varadkar's process.  With its establishment, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, gave a very clear commitment to legislate and give full effect to the final recommendation of the committee.  Now we hear that the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, is saying that he will not legislate on the basis of this report.  He is blatantly stating that he will go back on a commitment that he gave.  It was a very clear commitment.  The result of the committee's deliberation did not go his way and now he is using a mangled interpretation of the European water framework directive to spin his way and the Government's way out of trouble.<\/p> <p> The people have made their demands clear in protest after protest.  They delivered a mandate to this D&aacute;il to see that those demands were met.  The Oireachtas, containing the democratically elected representatives of the people, has made its recommendations through the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  These recommendations are fully in line with what the people of Ireland have been demanding for some years.  The Minister needs to heed the advice of the committee that he himself established.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, if he will tell the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, that he must stand by his word and legislate on the basis of the committee report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600004#B01200","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491477300,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom freisin f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh na daoine &oacute; Chontae Dh&uacute;n na nGall.

This is the only sight that the public will have to see of who is the next leader.  This audition is a test of who can break commitments that are made.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar has indicated that he is willing to break it, as has the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  It is a test of who cannot answer the questions most effectively in the best possible spirit of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, which is again clear today.<\/p>  <p>  Let me help Fine Gael and the two prospective taoisigh in front of us.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar quoted from one bullet point of the supply and confidence agreement.  If he had done us the favour of quoting the next bullet point things might be a bit clearer.  I quote: \"The Government will facilitate the passage of legislation, whether it be a money Bill or otherwise, for the implementation of the recommendations relating to domestic water charging supported by the Oireachtas, including abolition, a reformed charging regime or other options\".  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar should tell us if he is going to accept what has been agreed or if he is going to break it.  There is no question here.  The notion that the Attorney General read the report overnight - it was agreed yesterday, but we have not signed off on it yet - and said that it was not legal is nonsense.  Do not try and mislead the D&aacute;il.  Let us be clear what has happened here.<\/p><p>He was the one who declared us to be the sinister fringe, and talked about the reasonable people who did not have a problem with water charges, water commodification or the prospect of privatisation.  It turns out that we were not such a fringe and that we are a majority in society.  Hundreds of thousands of people protesting had an impact, as did people organising in their communities and 73% of people refusing to pay.  The result was a change of politics, including a change in the positions of different political parties.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, said at the end of last year that an unpaid bill would be an outstanding debt, just like an ESB bill or management charge, and that, ultimately, people would end up having to pay their bill.  It does not look very likely now, Minister, does it?<\/p> <p> The report recommends that water charges be abolished, refunds issued, a referendum on public ownership held, the metering programme halted and no excessive usage charge introduced.  The Minister's people decided to get legal advice yesterday and rang a lawyer in Tokyo to ask if it was okay to get rid of excessive usage charges.  The lawyer said it was grand but his people now say it is not proper legal advice.

In this regard, I compliment the Taoiseach on speaking up for the undocumented Irish in America in his excellent speech in Washington last month.  However, when it comes down to the practicalities, we appear to be putting barrier after barrier in the way of our emigrants returning home and making a contribution to the rebuilding of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  About 300,000 people left this country over the past decade to find work when jobs were not available here.  Many others were forced to extend stays abroad because of the downturn in our economy.  Many of these people now want to come back home, but for many it is an economic impossibility.  The cost of motor insurance is typical of the issues they face.  Drivers who have been out of the country for just two years lose any no-claims entitlements they had before they left, possibly adding thousands to already prohibitive insurance costs.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a particular barrier regarding access to universities and third-level colleges.  If people have lived outside the EU for two of the previous five years their children are treated as international students and must pay exorbitant fees to go to college.  Those fees could come to &euro;100,000 for an undergraduate course.<\/p>  <p>  I was recently contacted by a group of Irish families living and working in California for the past three to 12 years.  Most of them work with Medtronic, the medical device manufacturer, whose plant in Galway is one of the largest employers in Ireland with close to 3,000 workers directly employed there.  These are mainly highly educated and skilled people, Irish to the core, who feel they have much to contribute to this country if they were to return.  With many of them now having children approaching college age they are anxious that they should get an Irish third level education, but the costs allied to the reduction to their salaries should they return to Ireland, make this prohibitive.  If they go to college in the United States it is likely that they will stay there for their lives, their talents lost to Ireland along with those of their parents.<\/p>  <p>  Others in the United States are becoming more fearful for their future there because they are undocumented.  For them and many other Irish families in Australia, Canada and around the globe, the question of returning home is a heartbreaking quandary because they know if they do, their children will not be able to advance to a college education which is considered a basic necessity for accessing so many careers today.<\/p>  <p>  When will the Government remove the barrier to people returning home and relax the strict residency rules that are preventing Irish children from accessing affordable Irish education that should be their right?  They are essentially being treated as foreigners in their own land.<\/p>  <p>  One of the greatest difficulties for the undocumented Irish in the United States is the renewal of their Irish driver's licence.  For many, it is the only thing preventing deportation from the United States.  In all the sanctuary cities, the production of that licence saves people from arrest.<\/p><p>An Irish passport can be renewed online and at the post office, but a driver's licence cannot be renewed unless the applicant presents himself or herself in person at a National Driver Licence Service centre in this country.  This is an impossibility for those living in the US and other parts of the world.  When will the same online renewal facilities be extended to cover driver licences?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600008#F02700","speaker":"1313","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491479700,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising a number of important issues affecting the Irish abroad and returning migrants and for acknowledging the Taoiseach's important contribution to the effort to resolve the problems facing undocumented Irish living in the United States in particular.  I wish to record the fact that the Government has made the decision to extend voting rights in presidential elections from 2026 onwards to Irish citizens abroad.  The Deputy also mentioned the appointment of Senator Billy Lawless to represent the diaspora in our Seanad.<\/p>  <p>  At the moment 400 Irish citizens living abroad return every week to live in Ireland, which is a great thing to see.  Who would have thought only five or six years ago that we would be returning to net inward migration and that more people would be coming home to Ireland than are leaving?  This reflects better than most statistics the extent to which our economy has turned around and how well our jobs market is doing.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that we are devising a protocol on access to motor insurance for returning emigrants.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, wants to act on this in particular.  Those who are coming back here and taking up jobs want to be able to access insurance and carry their good no claims record with them, as they should be allowed to do.<\/p>  <p>  We run into a very particular issue in respect of education, which is that we must treat all EU citizens the same.  This means treating an Irish citizen exactly the same as we would a French, Italian or German citizen.  If we say to an Irish citizen who has never lived in Ireland that he or she is entitled to free education and college grants, we must say the same thing to more than 400 million EU citizens.  A consequence of providing free education and grants to anyone in the European Union who wants it would be the enormous cost implications for the State.  We need to take that into account.<\/p>  <p>  Our rules and regulations require a person to be resident in the State to have an Irish driver licence, but people can apply for their driver licence if back here for a short period of time.  If they have an Irish passport, they may wish to apply for the new passport card online, which can be done from America.  This could be useful in terms of having an ID.  It can be done using an app and providing a selfie online.  If photo ID is required, they can use the Irish passport card instead of the driver licence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600009#G00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1491479700,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  It is all very well to give our emigrants abroad the opportunity to vote in our presidential elections - I welcome it - but there is an issue regarding driver licences, particularly in the sanctuary cities in the Unites States.  Last year I attended a wedding in the United States where a number of Irish people came up to me.  Their biggest issue was that they cannot renew their Irish driver's licence.  The passport card is not a driver's licence.  When pulled in in the United States, the first thing a person is asked for is his or her driver's licence.  Most young Irish people in the United States are carpenters or labourers, etc. and they have to have a vehicle for work.  Some of them have been arrested.  The most important document a person has is his or her passport and an application can be made online, through An Post and by ordinary post.  However, this is not possible with a driver's licence.<\/p>  <p>  Recently in Australia, a young person's wallet was stolen with his driver's licence in it.  He turned up for work on the Monday morning but could not work because his job was driving.  He had to come home to get his driver's licence renewed and fly back out again.  It is one of the biggest issues affecting the young undocumented in the United States.  I will finish on a point that we have raised in the foreign affairs committee.

I am seeking cross-party support for what I believe is important legislation.  The aim of this legislation is to ensure local communities have the final say in any proposals for a county boundary change that affects them.  The Bill places a requirement on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to hold a plebiscite on any proposal for the redrawing of a county boundary.  The change to the local authority boundary can only take place where it is approved by a majority in the affected area.<\/p><p>Many communities across the country have been affected by arbitrary changes to county boundaries.  With the stroke of a pen, bureaucrats are changing the identity of a community without its agreement.  This is an issue in Monksland in County Roscommon.  The Athlone boundary report could lead to an annexation of the Monksland area in the next four years despite promises to the contrary.  Over 27,000 people made submissions to the Athlone boundary report.  The people of Roscommon shouted &quot;stop&quot;.  They were, and are, vehemently opposed to losing part of their county to neighbouring Westmeath in terms of cultural identity and sporting ties and for economic reasons, etc..  A number of members of the Save Roscommon group are present in the Visitors Gallery today, including the chairman, Mr. Tony Ward.  I acknowledge the tremendous work they have done to date on this campaign and I thank them for being here today.  <\/p><p>Unless a number of the stipulations of the boundary report are adhered to, the controversial boundary changes could still go ahead in four years' time.  Let nobody be fooled: this matter has been framed in a way that could lead to the annexation of the Monksland area in four years' time.  This legislation will copperfasten the position once and for all and only allow county boundary changes to be made through a vote of the people.  The deeply held sense of attachment and belonging to a county, be it Roscommon, south Kilkenny, Louth and so on, is threatened by a decision in the Customs House.  This Bill is about local democracy.  It will ensure that local people have the ultimate say on whether their county status is changed.  These decisions directly impact on people's sense of place, which has been shaped for centuries.  Forcing communities into something they do not want will only deepen their cynical view of politics and alienate citizens from the decision-making process which affects them.  This Bill will empower local communities to make the choice themselves by weighing up local identity and economic needs.  Local authority  boundary changes cannot be about bureaucratic map making or land grabs by adjacent counties.  Communities must be fully engaged in the process and have the final say on matters that impact on them.  This Fianna F&aacute;il Bill will help to achieve that and I urge my colleagues throughout the House to support it.  I call on those who want to support new politics and to be democratic to support this Bill and allow communities to be involved in the decision making process in situations where this issue arises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600014#M00600","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1491483000,"counter":173,"content":"<p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600015#N00100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491483000,"counter":174,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600015#N00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491483000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>It is not badly drafted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600015#N00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1491483000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

If we are to have private competition with public operators, it is critical that we have a basic threshold on pay and conditions, that a reliable service is provided and that all operators compete on a level playing field.  I am introducing this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party to stop the race to the bottom on terms and conditions in the bus sector.  This Bill proposes to amend section 10(3) of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, which currently requires that an applicant for a bus licence must demonstrate that it has &quot;the capacity to obtain the necessary financial and other resources&quot;, that it is in compliance &quot;with national and international legislation on road transport&quot; and that it possesses &quot;a current tax clearance certificate&quot;.<\/p><p>This Bill proposes to add new conditions for the awarding of licences by the National Transport Authority to private operators.  I am proposing that such an operator will have to &quot;engage in collective bargaining&quot; with its own workforce, or &quot;become a member of an association, representative of employers in the sector&quot;.  The second of these provisions would allow a sectoral employment order covering the private bus industry to be introduced.  These proposed conditions would ensure there is a more level playing field between private operators and public operators like Bus &Eacute;ireann.  If we agree to enable a sectoral employment order to be introduced, we will set a floor on terms and conditions for staff across the bus sector.  These provisions would mean that when a private operator receives a licence to operate a route, it will be bound to observe normal industrial relations practices, thereby preventing a race to the bottom on the terms and conditions of bus drivers.<\/p><p>Workers and employers have the right to associate and the right to refuse to associate.  Generally speaking, it is not constitutionally permissible to require an employer to join a representative negotiation body or to engage in collective bargaining with its workers.  For well over a century, however, public policy as expressed in legislation has been to ensure that unregulated labour markets do not result in workers receiving less than a living wage, particularly in sectors where there is no organisation and no equality of bargaining power, where good employers are undercut by bad employers and where there is a race to the bottom on terms and conditions of employment.  This has been the rationale behind a succession of State interventions, including wage councils, joint labour committees and sectoral employment orders.<\/p><p>As public transport is a licensed and regulated activity, there is a clear public interest in a well-functioning and reliable public transport system, with dependable buses running predictable schedules.  We would argue that there are overriding considerations of the common good at stake.  People want and are entitled to sustainable, secure and reasonably well-paid jobs.  The Bill I am proposing aims to strike the right balance between the needs of business and the right of workers to basic job security and a decent rate of pay.  This means rejecting jobs at any price and the spread of casual labour at the lowest level of wages.  Workers providing the services on which our society and our economy rely must be guaranteed basic standards of fair treatment in the workplace.<\/p><p>I welcome the talks that are under way in the Bus &Eacute;ireann dispute at the Workplace Relations Commission.  I hope a basis for a resolution of this crippling dispute can be found.  This strike has crippled rural Ireland, is crippling the company and is crippling the workers, who have now been without pay for 14 days.  There are no winners in this dispute.  There is an onus on the company to restore trust in the negotiations and to work to deliver a resolution.  We have proposed some common sense proposals with regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We are not calling for the Minister to step in and negotiate with the unions, but we are saying he has a role to play.  We have called for the establishment of a stakeholder forum.  The Minister could and should do this with immediate effect.  There are serious and complex transport policy issues at the heart of public transport in Ireland.<\/p><p>The Bill I am introducing on behalf of the Labour Party can address at least one of those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600015#N01200","speaker":"1301","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491483600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600016#O00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491483600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600016#O00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1491483600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600016#O00350","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491483600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600016#O00400","speaker":"1301"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491483600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Amendment) Bill 2017: First Stage","time":1491483600,"counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600016#O00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1491483600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts 2005 to 2015 to provide for enhanced powers to be granted to the Policing Authority for the purpose of overseeing the performance of the Garda Commissioner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions relating to policing services; to amend the provisions of the Acts relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate; and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>Some two weeks ago today, senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na made an extraordinary announcement at a press conference.  They informed the people of Ireland that between 2012 and 2016, 937,000 breath tests were falsely recorded on the Garda PULSE system.  They also informed the people of Ireland that between 2006 and 2016, 14,700 wrongful convictions took place in our District Courts because of errors made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I find it extraordinary that, to date, no member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been able to explain the reasons for these extraordinary discrepancies.  The reality is that they need to be described by the correct term, which is that they were caused, in large part, by wrongdoing.  There are many examples of how this process is being investigated.  The Garda is conducting its own inquiries and the Government has established inquiries, but answers need to be received in respect of those questions.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, we as a House of the Oireachtas must recognise that we need to use our primary function in order to deal with this particular crisis.  Our primary function is the making of law and, for that reason, we need to ensure senior management within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are thoroughly supervised so that issues like this cannot be put into the public domain at the time and choosing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>I say that in particular because of the fact that the Garda knew of discrepancies in respect of breath tests as far back as 2014.  We know the Garda, Minister and Government were aware of wrongful convictions as far back as July 2016.  Notwithstanding that, nothing has been done to date in respect of those wrongful convictions and the people who have suffered a miscarriage of justice.<\/p><p>I wish to introduce a Bill that would give greater powers to the Policing Authority.  The Bill seeks to amend the 2015 legislation that amended the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act in order to give greater powers to the Policing Authority.  In particular, it wishes to give powers to the Policing Authority so that it can supervise the functioning of the Office of the Garda Commissioner and supervise the discharge of functions by the Commissioner.  That is not just a proposal we are putting forward; rather, it is also a proposal contained in the report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality published late last year.<\/p><p>The Bill also seeks to establish policies and procedures for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which shall be binding on all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Furthermore, it seeks to cause to be published and made accessible to the public all sections of the Garda code and operational policies and procedures, save where such publication would undermine national security or crime prevention and detection, as decided by the authority in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>It also seeks to review the adequacy and appropriateness of the policies and procedures which underpin the operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We think, as a policy response to this issue, that there should be a transfer of functions to the Policing Authority.  It may be the case that, following the review of policing in Ireland going into the 21st century, further decisions are made.  In the future legislation may be introduced that will take away many of the current powers of the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and hand them to the Policing Authority.  That is something we are prepared to consider in detail.<\/p><p>The legislation also seeks to amend section 62 of the legislation by putting in place further powers to allow the Policing Authority if it is of the opinion that a member's conduct or continued membership of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is undermining public confidence to remove that member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That would have to be approved by the Government and take into account the entitlement of any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who is accused of such wrongdoing and whose removal is proposed to be able to defend himself or herself in accordance with the principles of natural justice.<\/p><p>We seek to introduce this Bill because we can express outrage in respect of crises, but the only way to deal with a crisis is to work through it.<\/p><p>Our primary function in this House is to draft laws to improve the country.  Let us look at how we can change the law to ensure the events which were disclosed two weeks ago do not happen again, or if there are such issues in the pipeline that the relevant authorities would be made aware of them promptly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600016#O00700","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491484200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Is the Bill being opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600017#P00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491484200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600017#P00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1491484200,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600017#P00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1491484200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600017#P00500","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491484200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1491484200,"counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600017#P00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1491484200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Ruth Coppinger - the dispute between the FAI and the national women's soccer team; (2) Deputy Joan Collins - the supply of Orkambi for cystic fibrosis patients; (3) Deputy Mary Butler - the provision of essential equipment by the HSE for a disabled child; (4) Deputy Niamh Smyth - the impact of the closure of Ulster Bank branches; (5) Deputy Willie Penrose - the funding for an extension at Mullingar Educate Together national school; (6) Deputy Michael D'Arcy - an affordable housing strategy for low to average earners; (7) Deputy Martin Kenny - the sale of IDA site at Kilgarry; (8) Deputy Carol Nolan - the operation of the fair deal scheme in relation to farm land; (9) Deputies Fiona O'Loughlin and Pat Buckley - youth worker and counselling services in Rathangan; (10) Deputy Charlie McConalogue - the recruitment of a paediatric consultant endocrinologist for the Letterkenny and Sligo area; (11) Deputy Brendan Smith - a school building project in Cootehill, County Cavan; (12) Deputy Mattie McGrath - the patient accommodation at South Tipperary General Hospital; (13) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett - building inflation costs in the education sector; (14) Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly - the reopening of the Irish embassy in Iran; and (15) Deputy Thomas Pringle - the closure of the diabetes treatment clinic in Letterkenny.<\/p>  <p>  The matters raised by Deputy Ruth Coppinger, Deputy Brendan Smith,  Deputy Mary Butler and Deputies Fiona O'Loughlin and Pat Buckley have been selected for discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600017#P00800","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Defence Forces: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1491484200,"counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600017#P00900"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491484200,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Lisa Chambers on Tuesday, 4 April 2017:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491484200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 to the motion was moved on Tuesday, 4 April 2017 by Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491484200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment to amendment No. 1:\r\n\r\nThat1(c) be deleted.\r\n\r\n- (Deputy Lisa Chambers)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491484200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to the motion regarding Standing Order 149.

My Department of Defence question was to highlight the experience, courage and bravery of the men of A Company who were present at the siege of Jadotville and to point out that their bravery had not been recognised in an appropriate manner in the form of medals.  This is sadly still the case and Donegal County Council passed a motion yesterday calling for same.  In the Minister's reply he referred to the fact that portraits of the commissioned officers had in fact been carried out.  In replying, I was trying to make the point that, while senior officers had been given some recognition, the men of A Company who were at the siege had not been so recognised.  In this I implied that Lieutenant Colonel McNamee had not been in Congo, while the point I wanted to make was that he had not been at the siege of Jadotville.  The family was upset by this because, of course, he was present, so I asked the Office of the Ceann Comhairle if I could make this statement today.

I could not have put it more aptly myself.  I am one of the lucky ones.  My husband may differ with me but I believe I have been happily married for the last 15 years.  I have not had to go through a separation or divorce and I hope I never do.  Having worked as a family lawyer, however, for two decades now this year, I know at first hand the truth in Ms Shackleton's words for so many separated couples throughout Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In marriage we promise ourselves to another \"till death do us part\".  This solemn vow reflects an ideal; the steady love and companionship of marriage that many of us hope to enjoy for the duration of our time on this earth.  Sadly, for many couples, this ideal is not reflected in reality.  Many marriages break down and these couples should not have to suffer the further stress of an unwieldy and harsh four-year rule before they can apply for a divorce.<\/p>  <p>  For too long Irish society was unwilling to face up to this reality.  Marital breakdown was often judged harshly.  This unwillingness to deal with the reality of marital breakdown was so prevalent in 1937 as to lead to divorce being explicitly banned in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Politics is the art of the possible.  While some might wish that we in the D&aacute;il could pass some legislation to mystically solve the marital problems faced by separating couples across the country, that is far beyond our powers.  It is rather our responsibility to deal with the reality.  It is our responsibility to accept the fact that marriages break down and to develop legislation to help, rather than hinder, separating couples as they strive to embark on the next chapters in their lives.  It is for this reason I wrote my family law book on mediation in 2012, and why I am now bringing this Bill before the House on Second Stage.  <\/p>  <p>  The current constitutional requirement for separating couples to live apart for four years out of the preceding five before initiating divorce proceedings is too long.  It is  cumbersome and restrictive, placing severe and unnecessary strain, both financial and emotional, on separating couples.  My Bill simply seeks to halve the necessary waiting time before initiating divorce proceedings from four years of living separated and apart out of the previous five to two years out of the previous three.  I believe this to be both fair and achievable and it  will make a significant positive difference to the lives of separating couples in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It was 30 years ago that former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, first attempted to tackle the issue of divorce.  Irish society was not ready for it then and his divorce referendum was roundly defeated.  Ten years later, when divorce would finally be passed by referendum, at the instigation of another former Taoiseach, John Bruton, it would only be by the thinnest of margins.  The price to win over a wary electorate was the mandating of a four-year waiting period in the Constitution.  The people said we could have divorce but they were not willing to make it easy.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has changed a lot in the past 20 years.  We have become a more open, welcoming society, less willing to judge the personal lives of others.  I do not believe that the attitudes towards divorce expressed in the 1995 referendum are a reflection of today's Ireland.  I remember the strong campaign against divorce in 1995.  The famous slogan \"Hello Divorce, Bye Bye Daddy\" did not hold true and the floodgates did not open.<\/p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We have not seen the wholesale breakdown of marriage in Ireland.  At one in ten, we have one of the lowest marital breakdown rates in the world, which is to be welcomed.  The Irish people, in the main, still rightly cherish the ideal of marriage.  This is also demonstrated by the great enthusiasm shown by Ireland&rsquo;s LGBT community in 2015 to gain equal access to marriage under Irish law.<br\/><br\/>Study after study on reduced mandatory waiting times for divorce reach the same conclusion - the enactment of this Bill will not promote marital breakdown.  It will simply allow people whose marriage has broken down to access the legislative certainty and finality of a divorce within a reasonable time.  We must do it by way of referendum because it is already in the Constitution.  I suggest it should be an issue to be voted on on a &quot;super referenda&quot; day in due course.<br\/><br\/>The 2016 census shows us a clear picture.  Over 280,000 Irish people have experienced marital breakdown.  Some 104,000 are divorced with 62,000 being remarried.  In addition 118,000 are separated or judicially separated.<br\/><br\/>For some, separation has been chosen over divorce, but for many, the decision not to pursue a divorce is driven by the sheer financial cost of prolonged legal proceedings imposed by the four-year rule.  The severe burden forced upon separating couples seeking a divorce by the four-year rule is far from limited to financial costs.  In my experience, prolonged matrimonial litigation serves only to increase hostilities and to prolong a process that will mark one of the most difficult periods in separating individuals&rsquo; lives.  It is hard to overstate the extreme stress caused by such a long divorce process, not only on a couple but on all those around them, particularly their children.<br\/><br\/>There is an increased risk of assets being hidden and relocations the longer the interim period between separation and divorce with resulting difficulties in enforcing maintenance and access orders.  In many cases, the time to reach a divorce settlement is so lengthy as to necessitate two separate sets of legal proceedings with many interim applications in the intervening time.  For some people it is necessary to get a deed of separation or a judicial separation prior to seeking a divorce in order to obtain some legal clarity on issues relating to the family home, property, pension and other ancillary reliefs.  Not only is this lengthy, but separation deeds and judicial separation decrees lack the finality and certainty of a divorce.<br\/><br\/>As we know the chief distinction between separation and divorce is the right to remarry.<br\/><br\/>We can and must do better and the Bill helps us to aim to achieve that.  It is not a radical departure in divorce law; it simply seeks to reduce the time limit from four years out of the preceding five to two years out of the preceding three.  Its aim is clear and its intention is straightforward.  It is important to stress that the other provisions of Article 41.3.2&deg; of the Constitution for divorce relating to there being no prospect of reconciliation and that proper provision is made for both parties and any dependent children will remain as is.<br\/><br\/>It is also important to point out that the section 20 factors outlined under the Divorce Act 1996 will also continue to be taken into account by judges of the Circuit Court or High Court in granting their decrees of divorce.  These are factors such as the earning capacity of the parties; their age; any accommodation needs; any physical or mental disability; conduct only if it is unjust to disregard it; contributions the spouses are likely to make into the future; the standard of living before living apart; whether a spouse has foregone any remunerative work to care for children; and the rights of any other spouses.  All of these criteria will still be taken into account by judges in making divorce decrees.  My Bill does not change that.<br\/><br\/>Looking at other jurisdictions, there is a standard two-year waiting period for divorces in the UK with mutual consent.  A number of US states, Belgium - without mutual consent - Italy and Greece have no waiting time.  There is a one-year waiting time in Spain.  France, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Scotland and Switzerland have waiting times around two years.  In Finland it is six months.  In Russia like Ireland it is nearly four years, however it has a quirky proviso that a husband cannot file without a wife&rsquo;s consent if she is pregnant or has a child under the age of one.<br\/><br\/>The trend across Europe and beyond is towards shortened mandatory waiting periods for divorce, which is widely seen as inherently fairer for separating couples.  I am greatly pleased by the cross-party support that has been expressed to me personally from politicians throughout this Chamber and indeed my own party.  I am also extremely pleased that so many civil society groups support the Bill.  Patricia Kearns from <i>separated.ie<\/i>is in the Gallery.  I thank her for coming along today and for her support and that of all the family lawyers who are enthusiastically backing this Bill.  I also thank my former parliamentary assistant Ois&iacute;n Crotty, a barrister at law, who conducted an enormous amount of research for me on the Bill and is also in the Gallery.<br\/><br\/>Twenty years after the introduction of divorce, I believe that Ireland in 2017 is confident enough to confront the realities of marital breakdown in this country and mature enough to recognise that our current divorce law is punitive and unfairly restricts the ability of thousands of Irish citizens who have separated from moving on with their lives.  It is time for this Chamber to stand up for Ireland&rsquo;s separated people and in the spirit of fairness lessen a major, unnecessary obstacle to beginning the next chapter of their lives following marital breakdown.<br\/><br\/>I am honoured, humbled and privileged to present the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Divorce) Bill 2016 to the House and I urge my colleagues to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600021#T00600","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491487200,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies O'Loughlin and Brassil.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Madigan on introducing the Bill and I assure her of Fianna F&aacute;il's support in respect of it.  Obviously, divorce in Ireland has been a lengthy and contentious issue.  Back in Brehon times divorce in Ireland was permitted on certain grounds.  However, when we became a modern independent State it was not permissible in Ireland.  When the Constitution was introduced in 1937 it contained a specific term precluding divorce from being permitted on our Statute Book.  We sometimes think that our country was a conservative outlier; that is not necessarily so.  Divorce was frowned upon in Victorian times and only certain countries had access to divorce.  Obviously as countries developed and matured, it became more acceptable.  As the influence of certain perceived moral values lessened, the whole issue of divorce became more liberal.<\/p>  <p>  We had a number of attempts to remove the constitutional ban on divorce.  In June 1986 a referendum was defeated significantly by 63% to 37%.  Nine years later another referendum was passed very narrowly by 50.28% to 49.72%.  I would have thought that part of the reason for it succeeding was that it stipulated that people be separated for four of the preceding five years.  In that regard it probably served a function.  However, as Deputy Madigan has stated we have now moved on 20 years.  As a party, we believe it is cruel to force people to be frozen in a status for a period of four years when it is clear that they cannot reconcile and that the marriage will not subsist in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's proposal is very sensible in referring to two out of the preceding three years.  I know some people would think it should be less than that, which might be a matter for another time.  We need to be careful that we retain consensus and support on the issue.  I believe Deputy Madigan has done that very well.  By limiting it to a period of two years out of three, I think it would be very hard for people to oppose it.  For any change to the Constitution it is necessary to get broad support and I believe she has achieved that.<\/p>  <p>  It looks as if the Bill will pass with the support of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il; I am sure the other parties will also support it.

Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Bill which, if enacted, would allow for a referendum to reduce the waiting period that a separated couple must undergo before they can be granted a divorce.  We recognise, as we did during the original divorce referendum in 1995, that the reality is some marriages break down over time and that sometimes this is irreparable.  In those circumstances, the commitment and love between two people required to sustain a marriage is no longer present and it is simply inhumane to require those people to continue to be bound by a legal partnership that they both want out of.  The electorate agreed with this and as a result the divorce referendum was passed in 1995.<\/p>  <p>  The very restrictive nature of the laws governing divorce in Ireland have their roots in the previous failed referendum of 1986, but the State has changed much more during the past 30, or even 20, years.  We recognise the diversity of families in Ireland and most people recognise that it is not their business whether other couples remain separated, divorce or stay together for whatever reason.  It is only our business in so far as we, as law makers, are the ones who need to initiate a change to make it more accessible for people to divorce.<\/p>  <p>  The outright ban on divorce in the Constitution between 1937 and 1995 did not serve society.  It did not serve those who were legally trapped in marriages which they did not want to be a part of.  We recall the strong resistance to the proposed divorce referendum by some organisations who insisted that the introduction of divorce in Ireland would open the floodgates of marital breakdown.  It is clear that this has not happened.  There were already thousands of separated persons in this jurisdiction before divorce was introduced.<\/p>  <p>  The results of a survey published last year showed that, although there was an overall increase in the number of couples in the EU getting divorced in 2015, Ireland and Luxembourg had the lowest rates of divorce.  The same study showed that Ireland had the highest proportion of young people and the highest fertility rate in the EU.  The divorce rate in Ireland is 0.6 people per 1,000, which is the third lowest rate in the world.  The rate of divorce is three times higher in the UK.  More research is needed on why this is the case.  Is it because Irish people find it more expensive or difficult to get married in the first place?  Do we have lower divorce rates because it is harder and more expensive to go through with a divorce?  Are more people in Ireland simply shackled not only by the bonds of marriage but by the bonds of negative equity preventing them from divorcing?  None of this is clear.  What is clear is that we need a legal framework that is fit for a modern country and fit for society&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>  <p>  The current waiting period is not acceptable.  It is nobody&rsquo;s business whether John and Mary from down the road decide to go their separate ways, but it is cruel to make them wait five years in order to divorce.  The sky will not fall in if we allow them to divorce after two years.  No one seriously considers it should take grown adults four years to decide whether to divorce.  What is the point of forcing people to wait a long period of time, especially given many of these people form relationships and have children with others in the intervening years before they can divorce?<\/p>  <p>  We need to trust adults to make the best decisions for themselves, their families and their relationships.  On that basis, we are happy to support the Bill and urge the Government to hold a referendum to make the appropriate change as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600023#V00300","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speech","time":1491487800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Ruth Coppinger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600023#V00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491487800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>That was close.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600023#V00500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1491487800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>By the skin of her teeth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600023#V00600","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1491487800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The first thing I would like to say on the proposal of a thirty-fifth amendment to the Constitution to change the timeframe for divorce is that when the referendum was passed in 1995 it included a requirement for a four year separation period prior to divorce proceedings being started.  I think it is not known by many people outside the House that this is stitched into the Constitution.  I think most people do not realise that.  I want to raise the issue of our putting legislation into the Constitution in the first place because this set a dangerous precedent and the discussion today bears that out.  Some 22 years after the original proposal we are now catching up with the reality for those who are going through a divorce, which is that four years is far too long and onerous.<\/p>  <p>  While we support the Bill and may consider tabling amendments to it should it get to a debate, there should be no time restrictions at all in the Constitution.  The Constitution could make reference to divorce being allowed.  However, why should it be necessary to have a majority vote every time we need to change a timeframe?  This relates to people's personal lives.  We should not have to hold a popular vote on whether we will allow Mary and Jack to have a divorce, which is essentially what we are saying.  The danger of the decision that was made to tie legislation into the Constitution to get the referendum passed will come up again with regard to the eighth amendment.  Those on the Government side and others have continually raised this as an issue and stated that we must show people the legislation, which is fine, but they also state that we must stitch it into the Constitution to get people to pass it.  We oppose the push to amend and not repeal the eighth amendment.<\/p><p>The political establishment wants to insert regulations and restrictions in the Constitution to tie the hands of the Oireachtas to legislate on abortion and the rights of women.  There is a view that forcing people to remain married for years after separation will persuade them to get back together.  I query the proposal to have a two-year waiting time for divorce.  In most cases, marriage breakdown is the outcome of a process lasting years.  People do not wake up and suddenly decide to divorce.<\/p> <p> Most women who experience domestic violence do so within marriage and this violence can continue for years.  Why should people face any impediment to ending a marriage, which is an arrangement they have made with another person?  This matter should not be decided in a popular vote.<\/p> <p> The housing crisis is having a significant impact on people who are enduring the anguish of separation.  Many separating couples are unable to move and are forced to stay together because they cannot afford to find other accommodation.  Even if the separation is amicable, their ability to move on is frustrated.  When the decision is not amicable, however, violence, psychological abuse and other issues can arise.  I am aware of many such cases.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to the census figures.  The figures published today are historic in that they show a 74% increase in the number of people who profess to have no religion.  A total of 468,000 people do not have a religion and I would wager that some of those who stated they were Catholic or belong to another religion do not practise their professed faith.  This D&aacute;il must start recognising this reality, including in its daily customs.  For example, in what other workplace would a prayer be said every day?  The idea that the church would interfere in people's decisions is also an issue.<\/p> <p> I am glad to support the Bill, which we may seek to amend if it proceeds.  We need full separation of church and State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600023#V00700","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491488400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I echo much of what Deputy Coppinger said.

The posters were very popular among those who were advocating in favour of divorce.  The referendum was narrowly passed by a margin of 50.28% to 49.72% in November 1995.  Thinking back on that campaign, it is interesting to compare it with the recent referendum on same sex marriage.

As the results from these areas came in, we saw the results of both referendums tipping in a positive direction.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome Deputy Madigan's Bill, although I agree with Deputy Coppinger that it should probably be amended.  Prior to the Russian Revolution in 1917, it was legal in Russia for men to beat up their wives.  One of the first acts of the revolutionary workers' government was to legalise divorce and abortion.  The pro-life movement and Catholic Church, including the bishop to whom I referred, told us the sky would fall in and the fabric of society would crumble if we allowed divorce.  In their view, we had to hold together the family, which meant mammy, daddy and 2.5 children.  Society's view of how families should function has changed utterly since that time.  One of the posters used by the anti-divorce side in the referendum campaign featured the slogan \"Hello Divorce, Bye Bye Daddy\".  The sky did not fall in when divorce was introduced but it is falling in now for many families because of the crisis in housing to which Deputy Coppinger referred. <\/p>  <p>  A very good friend of mine recently took the deliberate decision to retire early from her full-time job in Women's Aid.  The reason she did so was that she could not stand another day of going to court with women who were forced back into abusive relationships because nowhere could be found to house them.  This is happening every day in the courts.  Not only are people returning to relationships where there is no love but they and their children are being violently abused on a daily basis.  As I stated, my friend retired early to get away from the depressing reality of having to do this to families. <\/p>  <p>  Divorce must be available when people want it, rather than after two years.  While I welcome the move to advance this issue, an amendment to the Bill is probably needed.  Personal morality and control over one's life and relationships are fundamentally important and people must have a grip on them.  They cannot be forced to live in unhappy or oppressive circumstances.  For this reason, we are determined that a referendum on the eighth amendment should be put to the people.  This is the 21st century and generations of Irish people have not yet had a say or vote on these issues.  If we were to have a revolution in Ireland - God willing, we will have one - we must deliver the separation of church and State and deliver a society, including education and health services, which is not dictated by the religious or spiritual values held by one group.  Having a truly secular society that is literally divorced from the church is an important ambition for future generations.<\/p>  <p>  One of the reasons for our relatively low rate of divorce is that Ireland is riven by economic crises.  People tend to avail of legal separation because divorce is expensive, cumbersome and difficult.  A much more liberal divorce regime is required and I welcome Deputy Madigan's attempt to achieve this objective. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600024#W00400","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1491488400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Our divorce laws were archaic in 1995 and the same description can be applied to them today.  The purpose of the Bill is to reform our current process of divorce, which is very much welcome.  I am aware that this is an area in which Deputy Madigan has a great deal of professional experience and I commend her on introducing the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  From the outside, it seems our current approach is draconian.  It is still rooted in an era when divorce was viewed as a social ill rather than a legal right and an everyday reality.  The steps a couple must take to secure a divorce are onerous enough to amount to a punishment, rather than a fair process.  Even the most amicable of divorces needs to be ruled on by the Circuit Court or High Court.  As Deputy Madigan stated, divorce can place a serious strain on a couple's mental, emotional and financial well-being.  The measures proposed in the Bill would reduce this uncertainty somewhat by allowing couples the option of a divorce within two years of separation, rather than the current period of four years.  This would also allow them to avoid the additional legal and emotional costs incurred by seeking a judicial separation first.<\/p>  <p>  We must be mindful that the decision to live separately, regardless of whether a couple continue to share the same house, is not one any couple takes lightly.  Even at the two years proposed by the Deputy, the law would remain highly restrictive in European terms.  It would still prohibit any legislation aimed at addressing circumstances where a divorce may be sought in a shorter timeframe.  For example, the one-year separation period in Canada can be waived in cases where a spouse is mentally or physically abusive.<\/p><p>While the Bill's provisions are welcome, there is no logical reason to fail to go further.  If we are to put a constitutional amendment to the people, one which is effectively administrative, why not remove this matter from the Constitution?  Surely it is more suitably dealt with through primary legislation rather than a constitutional provision.<\/p> <p> Marriage, of course, is a deeply personal issue.  We hope it is based on love in all cases but, for many, its significance is religious, for others, it is social and, indeed, for some it may be a purely financial decision, or one undertaken to avoid the shortfalls in our current guardianship legislation.  By the same token, anyone who chooses to end a marriage does so for their own reasons.  Regardless of whether one believes that the institution of marriage requires constitutional protection from attack, there is no need for the mechanics of obtaining a divorce to be provided with the same level of defence.  Fundamentally, the Constitution is not the appropriate place for practicalities.  The concerns of most people who engage in divorce proceedings are not about the social significance of marriage; they are worried about custody arrangements, the cost of legal fees, and the time the process will take.  Placing a constitutional restriction on the time it takes for a couple to be entitled to a divorce restricts our ability to fairly reflect this range of opinions in legislation.<\/p> <p> Before her election to this House, Deputy Madigan practised law in this area.  Why she has chosen to maintain the inclusion of a constitutional provision?  Why was two years rather than 12 months, for example, selected?  This is a worthwhile Bill in as far as it goes but we need to start giving serious consideration to taking this provision out of the Constitution altogether.  The Social Democrats fully support the legislation and we warmly commend the Deputy on bringing it forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600024#W00500","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491489000,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I am delighted to contribute to the debate and to offer my support for the Bill.  I acknowledge the significant work Deputy Madigan has put in, as she brings forward a timely reform, which in many ways is overdue.  I doubt many of us in 1994 thought that this provision would not have been amended within a shorter period.<\/p>  <p>  The history of divorce in Ireland makes interesting reading.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said, divorce was legal throughout most of our history.  It was legal under Brehon and Celtic law and under the Act of Union when we were part of the UK.  Although divorce was uncommon, it happened and Charles Stewart Parnell is an example of somebody who married a divorcee.  It was only in the 1920s, unfortunately under a Cumann na nGaedheal Government, that the decision was take to prohibit divorce and that was copperfastened in the 1937 Constitution, which was a pity.  I am slightly at cross purposes to Deputy Coppinger earlier.  Once something is inserted in the Constitution, it is then very hard to amend it.  It would have been better if the 1937 provision had not been put in the Constitution.  Had it not, some provision would have been made for divorce and the right to remarry, perhaps in the 1970s or 1980s.<\/p>  <p>  That did not happen and a referendum led by the great constitutional crusader, Garret FitzGerald, was defeated in the 1980s.  I have a vague recollection of that campaign as a child and of the scaremongering that caused the amendment to be defeated.  Nothing happened until the 1990s until another member of my party, former Minister, Alan Shatter, brought forward Private Members' judicial separation legislation similar to the recent civil partnership legislation to \"almost\" allow for divorce.  That was a major step forward.  In 1994, the rainbow Government of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left brought forward the provision and put it to a referendum again.  I recall that campaign well because it was the first in which I took part as a young person interested in politics.  I dropped leaflets with Young Fine Gael at the time.<\/p>  <p>  We framed the campaign for the right to remarry to give people a second chance.  That was one of the strong arguments in its favour.  However, I was surprised at the time because I then began to attend for the first time other Fine Gael branch meetings and was struck by the large number of people within the party who were opposed to divorce and who did not agree at all with the provision.  I recall the scaremongering at the time about the impact of property rights and people losing the family farm, for example.  Much of our law, particularly when it comes to personal relationships, derives from property rights and not Christian religion.  A big fear was losing the family business or the family farm.  There were stories about how family life in Ireland would break down and it would turn into a scene from \"Home and Away\" where virtually nobody would live with their married parents anymore.  The referendum passed and, of course, and none of those scare stories turned out to be true.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains a country in which divorce is uncommon.  I detected from Deputy Smith's contribution that perhaps she regretted that and that she thought the divorce rate should be higher.  I am not sure that is what she meant but that is certainly what she implied and I do not share that view.  It is good that, culturally, in Ireland people tend to marry late and when they marry, they tend to stay married, although on some occasions, marriages do not work and people divorce and remarry.  I recall the count following the 1994 campaign a little differently from Deputy Smith.  The largest \"Yes\" votes in that referendum were in the south Dublin constituencies.  Dublin South, Dublin South East and D&uacute;n Laoghaire had massive \"Yes\" votes and there was also a good \"Yes\" vote in west Dublin.  However, we were very much a divided society, much more so than was the case with the recent marriage equality referendum.  The divorce referendum only passed in Dublin, Limerick East, Cork South Central, Louth and perhaps one of the Kildare constituencies or Wicklow.  The vast majority of constituencies voted \"No\", which was much different from the voting pattern in the marriage equality referendum with only one constituency narrowly voting \"No\".  Were it not for the fact that the rainbow Government wrote reassurances and safeguards and protections into the Constitution, that referendum would not have passed.  It might not have been the right thing to do but it was probably the politically necessary thing to do because the divorce referendum only passed by 50.28% to 49.72%.  There were only 10,000 votes approximately in it, which is extraordinarily close.  The safeguards and reassurances written into the Constitution were crucial to its passage.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with other Deputies that it would have been better if the amendment had never been inserted in the Constitution in the first place.  It may well be the case that it will be necessary to replace it with a new amendment or we may face a referendum simply on repeal being defeated again and the issue being set aside for the best part of a generation.  Of course, that is a different issue.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation relates to the divorce and the right to remarry.  I have an open mind as to whether the period should be one or two years and as to whether there should be a waiting period if two people amicably want to dissolve their marriage.  It is a good idea to have some provision preventing it from being too easy to get divorced but if there is no dispute, perhaps that should be a matter between the two individuals concerned.  I welcome the legislation.  A queue of constitutional amendments is building up, which I jotted down the other day.  There is a likelihood of a referendum on the eighth amendment next year.  There is also a need to have referenda on issues such as blasphemy, the place of women in the home, the patent court and several other matters, including the extension of voting rights in presidential elections to citizens living abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600025#X00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1491489000,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Property rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600025#X00300","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1491489000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>There could be referendums on many issues.<\/p><p>It was part of our manifesto in 2011 to have a big Constitution day on which we would have perhaps ten referenda on the same day.

Deputy Madigan's Bill proposes to amend Article 41.3.2&deg; of the Constitution to reduce the time period that spouses applying for a divorce must have lived apart from at least four years during the previous five years to at least two years during the previous three years.  As in the case of any Bill proposing an amendment to the Constitution, before the Bill can be signed into law, a referendum will be required to allow the people the opportunity to decide on this significant proposed change to the Constitution.<\/p>  <p>  Under Article 41.3.2&deg; of the Constitution, as amended by the fifteenth amendment, a court may grant a divorce only where specific conditions have been met.  The first condition is that on the date of institution of the divorce proceedings, the spouses have lived apart from one another for a total of at least four years during the previous five years.  The second condition is there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses.  The third condition is that proper provision exists and will be made by the spouses for any children of either or both of them.  The final condition is that any further conditions as prescribed by law are complied with.  The then Government's rationale for specifying the basic conditions for divorce in the Constitution was to ensure there would not be any change to those conditions without reference to the people.  When the Bill that became the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1995 was debated in the House it was explained that the purpose of the mandatory four-year period of living apart was to ensure divorce would not be available on an easy or casual basis in order to address concerns about quickie divorces and the development of a divorce culture in Ireland.  We must remember we were moving at the time from a situation where the Constitution provided unequivocally that no law would be enacted providing for the granting of the dissolution of marriage to a situation in which divorce was to become possible in Ireland for the first time but subject to various specific conditions which were outlined into the new Article inserted by the fifteenth amendment.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, outlined that very clearly earlier on.  The four-year period was intended to ensure spouses would not enter into divorce lightly and would have the necessary time to reflect on the serious steps they were taking.  It was also considered that the four-year period would encourage spouses to attempt to reach agreement on the terms of their separation so the key elements relating to children, finance and property could be settled before an application of divorce was made to a court.  In this way, the court hearing may be less acrimonious than it otherwise might be.  The four-year period of separation can be accumulated over a five-year period.  The reason for this is to allow a couple to make a reasonable attempt at reconciliation in the knowledge that if it does not work out, they will not have lost their option to apply for divorce.  <\/p>  <p>  The Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 which followed the fifteenth amendment made provision for the exercise by the courts of the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution to grant decrees of divorce and enabled the courts to make certain preliminary and ancillary orders in and after proceedings for divorce.  Contrary to the fears expressed at the time, as captured for example the \"Hello Divorce, Bye Bye Daddy\" posters, it does not appear that a divorce culture has developed in Ireland.  The CSO's Measuring Ireland's Progress report in 2015 indicates Ireland has the lowest divorce rate in the EU in 2014 at 0.06 divorces per 1,000 of the population while the average rate in the EU was two per 1,000.<\/p>  <p>  Now that more than 20 years have passed since the introduction of divorce in Ireland, the Government believes it is appropriate to re-examine the provisions of Article 41.3.2&deg; of the Constitution and for that reason it very much welcomes this Private Members' Bill initiated by Deputy Madigan.  Shortening the living apart period will enable couple whose marriage has broken down to regularise their affairs sooner and reduce the legal costs involved.  Couples will be less likely to need to apply for judicial separation while waiting to become eligible to apply for divorce.  In advance of Committee Stage, the Department of Justice and Equality will examine the wording of the Bill in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General to ascertain whether any technical drafting amendments may be required to the text of the proposed constitutional amendments. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the establishment of a family law court structure that is streamlined, more efficient and less costly.  The Department of Justice and Equality is working on a general scheme of a family court Bill and we will be engaging in further consultation with relevant stakeholders on the operational aspects of a new family court structure.  The general scheme will be published this year following its approval by Government and will be subject to the usual pre-legislative scrutiny process.  The family court Bill will aim to streamline family law court processes, clarify jurisdictional issues and provide for a set of guiding principles to help ensure the family court will operate in a user friendly and efficient manner.  The intention is to establish a dedicated family court within the existing court structures.  The family court Bill will also support the proposals in the Mediation Bill 2017, which Deputy Madigan is very interested in, by encouraging greater use of alternative dispute resolution to assist in more timely resolution of family law cases.  The Mediation Bill, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the House, contains certain proposals for a comprehensive statutory framework to promote the resolution of dispute through mediation as an alternative to court proceedings.  This is intended to reduce legal costs, speed up the resolution of disputes and reduce the stress and acrimony which often accompanies court proceedings.  In its 2010 report on alternative dispute resolution, mediation and reconciliation, the Law Reform Commission emphasised the potential benefits of mediation in family law proceedings and of mediation information sessions where the benefits and advantages of mediation could be explained before the commencement of court proceedings.  Section 23 of the Mediation Bill provides that the Minister for Justice and Equality may for the purpose of ensuring the availability of mediation information sessions at reasonable cost and in suitable locations, prepare and publish a scheme for the delivery of such sessions or approve a scheme for the delivery of such sessions by another person or body.  The Legal Aid Board is already involved in the provision of a free family mediation service, the benefits of which are widely acknowledged especially in cases in which children are involved.  <\/p>  <p>  To return to the Bill, on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste, I inform the House that as a further step, the Government is of the view it should at this stage be open to proposing the removal of all the conditions for the grant of a divorce set out in Article 41.3.2&deg; of the Constitution.  This would not be intended to take away the regulation of divorce and matters associated with it, but it would mean the conditions for the granting of a divorce will be prescribed by an Act of the Oireachtas and not by the Constitution.  This could facilitate clean-break divorces where appropriate and in which the possibility of financial and other orders made by a court when granting a divorce being subsequently revisited or varied could be restricted.  The Government has agreed to bring forward amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage to provide for such a constitutional amendment.  The Department of Justice and Equality will work with the Office of the Attorney General to formulate an appropriate wording for the amendments.  We will also have to be careful to hear the further views of those who are experts in this area in formulating these proposals.  It is noted that if this Bill passes Second Stage it will be referred to the Committee on Justice and Equality for pre-legislative scrutiny in accordance with Standing Order 141.  The T&aacute;naiste and I look forward to engaging with the committee on the provisions of this Bill.  The pre-legislative scrutiny is a very important part of legislative proceedings.  The committee will do a good job under the current Chairman.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Madigan for bringing forward this Bill and initiating a timely debate on the constitutional requirements for divorce.  There will obviously be different views and experiences to be listened to very carefully on this subject.  Ultimately, if the Bill is passed by the Houses, the people will have their say in a referendum.  This is manifestly not a subject any of us would or should take lightly but is one in which the Government, in supporting Deputy Madigan's Bill, believes it is now appropriate to lead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600026#Y00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491489600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491489600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An Bille um an gC&uacute;igi&uacute; Leas&uacute; is Tr&iacute;ocha ar an mBunreacht (Colscaradh) 2016: Tarchur chuig Roghchoiste - Thirty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (Divorce) Bill 2016: Referral to Select Committee","time":1491489600,"counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600026#Y00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1491489600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Tairgim:<\/p><blockquote>Go gcuirfear an Bille faoi bhr&aacute;id an Roghfhochoiste um Dhl&iacute; agus Ceart agus Comhionannas de r&eacute;ir Bunord&uacute; 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) agus 141.<\/blockquote><p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and 141.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600026#Y00600","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491489600,"counter":245,"content":"<p>Cuireadh agus aonta&iacute;odh an cheist.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491489600,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Hallmarking (Amendment) Bill 2016: Second Stage","time":1491489600,"counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600026#Y00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1491489600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to update and modernise Irish law relating to hallmarking by, first, amending the law relating to the assaying and hallmarking of articles of precious metals to include palladium and mixed precious metals in the definition of articles of precious metals and, second, by making provision for the possibility for the Irish Assay Office to assay and hallmark articles of precious metal outside the State in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>Third, it provides for offences and penalties relating to forged hallmarks.<\/p> <p> The term \"Hallmarking\" describes the administrative and legal system for ensuring that articles of precious metals conform to legal standards as to the fineness of the metals.  Fineness is a measure of the quality of a precious metal and represents its purity in an alloy as determined by assaying the article.  Legislation dating back to 1637 states that no article made from named precious metals can be sold in Ireland without it being assayed and hallmarked.  This is one of the earliest examples of consumer protection legislation in Ireland.<\/p> <p> The term \"precious metal\", as defined in section 1 of the Hallmarking Act 1981, covers articles made from gold, silver or platinum or alloys of these.  Such precious metals must bear an Irish hallmark, a hallmark of the international hallmarking Convention on the Control and Marking of Articles of Precious Metals, of which Ireland is a member, or an approved hallmark from an EU member state in order that they can be legally offered for sale in this country.  Every article of precious metal must be hallmarked.<\/p> <p> In addition to hallmarks, articles of precious metals commonly bear a sponsor&rsquo;s mark.  This identifies the person who submits the article for hallmarking, that is, a dealer or the person who made the article or who worked it into its finished state.  As a result, the owner of an article can identify not just the metal's fineness and the assay office that determined it, but also the origin of the article.<\/p> <p> The primary legislation dealing with hallmarking in Ireland is the 1981 Act.  Regulations made under it include the Hallmarking (Irish Standards of Fineness) Regulations 1983 and the Hallmarking (Irish Standards of Fineness) (Amendment) Regulations 1990, which list the approved standards of fineness for articles made from or containing precious metals.  These regulations are in addition the standards of fineness referred to in the charter granted to the Wardens and Commonalty of Goldsmiths of the city of Dublin on 22 December 1637, section 22 of the Plate Assay Act 1783 and section 3 of the Plate Assay (Ireland) Act 1807.<\/p> <p> The Company of Goldsmiths of Dublin governs the Dublin Assay Office, which is situated in Dublin Castle.  The Irish Assay Office, IAO, is the independent, self-funding, third party, State-appointed test laboratory that assays and hallmarks items of gold, silver and platinum jewellery and plate articles that are either manufactured in Ireland or imported.  The mark of the assay office is the indication that the precious metal conforms to a certain standard of fineness.  The public is therefore assured that, for example, an article that states that it is pure gold actually is pure gold.<\/p> <p> Since the current legislation was introduced in 1981, there have been advances in the jewellery trade.  Palladium has been recognised as a precious metal and there has been an increase in the production of jewellery made of mixed precious metals.  Under current legislation, the assay office cannot legally hallmark palladium or articles made from mixed precious metals, as the 1981 Act does not provide for this.  However, Irish consumers may not be familiar with overseas hallmarks in the same way as they are knowledgeable about and aware of Irish hallmarks and they may be misled when purchasing such an article.  The introduction of new Irish hallmarks for articles made of palladium and mixed precious metals would provide effective protection for consumers, increase consumer confidence in the fineness of the precious metal articles and promote fair trade.<\/p> <p> In recent times, there has been a trend towards assay offices in other jurisdictions opening offices outside their countries of residence or placing officials in factories abroad in order to assay and mark articles of precious metals on site.  This practice has been made for business reasons, since it is easier for a manufacturer if the testing and marking are done in the factory where the product is made, with the delivery time being shortened and the product being packed for retail display at source.  Compliance is also facilitated by having the testing and marking done before products enter, for example, an EU member state.  This has happened in the UK and the Netherlands.<\/p> <p> In order to have the possibility of engaging in such offshore assaying if it chose to do so, the assay office made a request to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to amend the 1981 Act to that effect.  While it is my understanding that the need for such offshore marking is not currently required and that the assay office does not intend on engaging in such activity in the near future, legislating for the possibility at this stage is seen as a prudent way of ensuring that the facility is available if required.  Approval from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation would be required for any such offshore activity by the assay office under the proposed legislation.<\/p> <p> The same prudent approach lies behind the proposed provision allowing for the possibility of the IAO entering into an arrangement with another assay office to hallmark precious metals.  For example, such a scenario might arise where the volume of articles of a specific precious metal might not justify expenditure on the assaying equipment for that metal.<\/p> <p> The issue of offshore marking has undergone fluctuating phases of popularity and desirability in recent years.  However, the provision of an enabling legal basis for offshore marking does not oblige the IAO to open offshore offices.  Rather, it ensures that, if offshore marking is ever required by the office in the future, no new primary legislation will have to be introduced.<\/p> <p> As the Bill is a technical measure, consultation with the European Commission and all other EU member states was required under EU law.  That consultation period has now passed and no submissions were received from parties in other member states or from the Commission.<\/p> <p> Turning to the specific provisions of the Bill, I will explain what each is designed to achieve.  While three principal issues are involved, the technical nature of the Bill means that a wide range of amendments to the 1981 Act are required to give effect to these changes.  Section 1 on definitions and section 15 on the Short Title and commencement are standard legislative provisions while sections 2 to 14, inclusive, are the core provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for amendments to section 1 of the 1981 Act by amending that Act&rsquo;s definitions to add palladium and mixed precious metals to the definition of \"articles of precious metal\", include a definition to cover hallmarking in assay offices outside the State, and define what constitutes a \"forged hallmark\".<\/p> <p> Section 3 provides for an amendment to section 2 of the 1981 Act enabling the assay office, if it is approved to engage in offshore marking, to strike hallmarks outside the State and for articles bearing those hallmarks to be treated in the same way as articles bearing hallmarks struck in the State.  Section 4 provides for an amendment to section 3 of the 1981 Act to allow for the making of regulations to prescribe different marks for hallmarks applied in Ireland and for those applied offshore.  Section 5 provides for a technical amendment to section 4 of the 1981 Act regarding forged hallmarks.  Section 6 provides for the addition of three new sections to the 1981 Act to allow offshore hallmarking to take place if the IAO chooses to engage in such activity.  Thus, it is only providing for the opportunity to do so rather than placing any obligation on the office to do so.<\/p> <p> The first new section gives the IAO the potential to open authorised offices outside the island of Ireland that can assay and hallmark articles of precious metal as if it were done by the assay office in Dublin.  However, this offshore office can only be established with the permission of the Minister of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In seeking the Minister&rsquo;s permission to establish an offshore office, the assay office must provide detailed information on how that office will be managed, for example, its governance and administration, the employment terms and conditions of any staff that may be employed in the offshore office and the costs of establishing such an office.<\/p> <p> The second new section provides that the IAO, if it so desires and with the consent of the Minister, can enter into an agreement with another assay office of another contracting party to the international hallmarking convention to carry out assaying and hallmarking that conform to Irish standards.  The new section also sets out the information that the IAO must supply to the Minister when seeking the Minister&rsquo;s consent for such an agreement in terms of corporate governance, administration and management of that assay office, the terms and conditions of any agreement with that assay office and the charges that are to be imposed by that assay office.<\/p> <p> The third new section provides for the granting of specified powers to the IAO in terms of an official seal and authorisations on its behalf to carry out assaying and hallmarking that conform to Irish standards where the IAO chooses to establish an offshore assay office or enter into an agreement with an assay office of another contracting party to the international convention.<\/p> <p> Section 7 provides for a technical amendment to section 5(1) of the 1981 Act by adding palladium to the list of articles of precious metals for which it is an offence to apply a false trade description.  Section 8 provides for a technical amendment to section 6(2) of the 1981 Act by adding palladium to the list of articles of precious metals qualified by the word \"plated\".  Section 9 provides for a technical amendment to section 8 of the 1981 Act by adding palladium to the list of articles of precious metals to ensure that every reference to gold or silver in an enactment specified in subsection (2) shall be construed as including a reference to palladium.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Section 10 provides for an amendment to section 9 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 to allow the Irish Assay Office and a sponsor to make arrangements for the sponsor's mark to be struck by the Assay Master or an authorised assay office as soon as practicable after the submission of the article for the striking of an approved offshore hallmark in accordance with section 6 of this Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 11 provides for an amendment to section 12 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 to ensure that in the case of additions to existing articles of precious metal the added metal is of the same precious metal as the existing article.  It also provides technical amendments to certain cases of coatings added to existing articles of precious metals.<\/p> <p> Section 12 provides for the inclusion of provisions on offences and penalties related to forged hallmarks.  Section 13 provides for an amendment to section 14 of the Hallmarking Act 1981 by providing for the Irish Assay Office to make charges, with the consent of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, for hallmarks applied in any offshore assay offices it establishes under section 6 of this Bill, in the same way as it currently does for hallmarking in its Dublin office.<\/p> <p> Section 14 is a standard repeals provision and provides for the repeal of sections of the Plate Assay (Ireland) Act 1807 and section 13 of the Hallmarking Act 1981, both of whose subject matter are now covered by section 12 of the Bill.<\/p> <p> After a house and a car, jewellery is one of the most expensive outlays for consumers in their lives and it is important that they are assured that they are getting what they pay for, particularly given the often very sentimental value that also attaches to such articles.  This Bill aims to enhance consumer protection and to strengthen consumer confidence regarding the proper hallmarking of articles of precious metal in respect of their finesse.<\/p> <p> I look forward to working with Deputies on Committee and Report Stages of this Bill in terms of any amendments that may be proposed.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and I will be happy to reply to any questions arising.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600026#Y00800","speaker":"1339","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491490800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for introducing this Bill to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the general principles of the Hallmarking (Amendment) Bill 2016 and its passage to the next Stage and looks forward to further engagement on it with the Minister, including any amendments that may be required.<\/p>  <p>  Hallmarking is essentially a quality assurance measure designed to give comfort to purchasers of valuable items, usually jewellery, that they consist of what they are supposed to consist of in terms of the precious minerals within.  The addition in the Bill of the category of palladium in the definition of precious metals appears sensible.  This is an emerging trend in jewellery, I am told and so it is right that it would have the same protection gold, silver and platinum have enjoyed to date.<\/p>  <p>  During debate on the mining Bill in the House some weeks ago we heard of how earth minerals are now emerging from zinc and ore deposits which were not previously thought to be valuable.  Consumer electronics are extremely valuable.  It is always the way that technology and science makes progress and as such more minerals and more metals are added to various lists of value, in this case palladium.  Measures to extend the assaying and hallmarking of such metals to offices outside the State are, as outlined by the Minister of State, a key part of this Bill.  The Minister of State referred in her speech to the governance and operation of those offices.  It is important that when we are outsourcing, or in this case enabling a remote operation of Irish equality assurance, that we regulate stringently and ensure that that offshore office is held to the same degree of standards, governance and integrity as an onshore office.  I ask that the Minister of State and the Department officials bear that in mind.  Acknowledging that the Minister of State already mentioned the many checks and balances in place in that regard.  That said, this appears to be a sensible measure.<\/p>  <p>  The measures to strengthen the regulation of hallmarking benefit consumers in that they provide a level of quality assurance and confidence.  It is important that we have such a mark, which is undetectable to the human eye, to protect people who propose to engage in the purchase or sale of such items.  There are new offences created in this Bill in relation to forgery.  The Bill also provides for prosecution in that regard by changing the definition of such offences.  In other words, there is a change in those offences to require proof of knowledge or belief that the mark was a forged hallmark rather than the previous burden of proof which was slightly more difficult to prove in a court of law or to prosecute.  Again, that will be of benefit to the industry and consumers in general.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this Bill as it progresses through the Houses, I would like to flag one area of concern.  Like other Deputies I have received correspondence on this Bill.  The Minister of State mentioned that there was detailed consultation on this matter throughout the EU because this is a technical measure and such was required.  I do not believe anything major arose in that regard.  As I said, I have received correspondence from the industry to the effect that the primary representative organisations domestically, including the Irish Jewellers Association, the Federation of Jewellery Manufacturers of Ireland and Retail Jewellers of Ireland, were not consulted.  While they have not flagged any specific concerns in relation to the Bill they have expressed concern that they have not been consulted on it.  Perhaps the Minister of State would advise what level of engagement took place and if no such engagement has taken place to date, perhaps it could take place before we move to Committee Stage to allow the industry an opportunity to raise any concerns it might have, which could be addressed by way of amendment with the agreement of all parties.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State mentioned the Bill provides for repeal of various statutes, as is always the case when legislation of this type is being introduced.  I note the standards in this area vary slightly across the EU.  Some EU states do not have an independent hallmarking body and others do.  It makes sense to me that we would have such a body and that it be managed by the Department and the State and the correct standards applied.  This is a niche area.  If we are setting out a point of reference on which a value will hinge it is important that that practice be tightly and stringently regulated to ensure the types of offences mentioned earlier do not occur.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, Fianna F&aacute;il is supportive of this Bill.  It marks progress in this area and is welcomed by this side of the House.  I look forward to further engagement on it as it progresses through the Houses.  I again ask the Minister of State to ensure there is consultation with the industry, if such consultation has not already taken place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600028#AA00150","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1491490800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I too thank the Minister of State for introducing this Bill, which Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is technical in nature, with the main aim of including palladium and mixed precious metals on the list of precious metals that can be hallmarked by the Irish Assay Office.  It also provides for the possibility of an offshore marking by the Irish Assay Office in the future, if it so wishes, with ministerial approval, in case future trends in hallmarking demand it.  Hallmarking is one of the oldest forms of consumer protection.  It has existed in Ireland since 1637.  Understandably, jewellers in Ireland would be particularly interested in any reform of this area.  Like Deputy Lawless, I am disappointed that key stakeholders were not consulted on this area of reform.  I was in contact with a representative from the Irish Jewellers Association during the week who is concerned that his organisation, the Retail Jewellers of Ireland and the Federation of Jewellery Manufacturers of Ireland were not notified of changes in legislation in their area of work.  Having listened to the concerns of those stakeholders, it is appropriate for me to highlight the sector&rsquo;s worries now in order that there can be a more detailed discussion on them on Committee stage, with amendments to follow, if necessary.  One specific amendment that could be introduced is an exemption in weights, as is done in other countries.  Adding a hallmark costs money to each piece of jewellery - approximately &euro;0.66 per item - and so this is pushing up the cost for smaller pieces of jewellery with tiny weights of these precious metals.  I appreciate the need for hallmarking on larger and heavier pieces to provide the consumer with certainty that the piece is of high quality, but I think this is too burdensome for producers for small, cheap pieces.<\/p><p>This Bill seems to be following the lead of UK, which introduced palladium as a precious metal in 2009 and legislated for national assay offices abroad in 2013.  The UK has provided for an exemption of this kind for metals under a certain weight.  The exemption thresholds in the UK are 1g for gold, 7.78g for silver, 0.5g for platinum and 1g for palladium.  Will the Minister consider providing for similar exemptions in this Bill?<\/p> <p> Another factor that has been highlighted is the lack of inspections to ensure shops that are selling these precious metals are in full compliance with the current regulations.  Is the Minister satisfied that sufficiently severe penalties are in place in this Bill and in existing legislation to deter abuse of hallmarking metals in Ireland?  I am pleased that the Minister is being given the ability to set up an offshore assay office if she wishes.  As Deputy Lawless has outlined, we need to ensure the same standards that apply here in Ireland also apply in the sub-offices overseas.  I recognise the importance of hallmarking as a protection for consumers.  I welcome this Bill, which updates the law in line with emerging trends.  However, I am concerned that adequate consultation has not been undertaken with relevant stakeholders.  I hope this will be addressed in advance of Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600028#AA00200","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491491400,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Lawless and Quinlivan for their contributions and for their parties' support for the contents of this Bill.  I will address the concerns they have expressed to the best of my ability.  I want to repeat that the offshore hallmarking provision is not an obligatory one - it merely allows the Irish Assay Office, if it ever chooses to do so, to apply to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for approval.  As I noted at the start of this debate, my understanding is that such offshore marking is not currently required and that the Irish Assay Office does not intend to engage in such activity in the near future.  I assure the House that the same standards will continue to apply to Irish hallmarked articles.  The Deputies have suggested that they might introduce amendments to this Bill at a later stage.  I am advised that the Minister is willing to examine such amendments in a constructive manner, as long as they do not undermine the current system of hallmarking in Ireland or result in a reduction in the level of consumer protection provided for under the current legislative framework.<\/p>  <p>  I want to respond to the points the Deputies made about the perceived lack of consultation.  This Bill has been in gestation for a long time.  It was part of the previous Government's legislative programme.  Between 2012 and 2013, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation consulted all the relevant stakeholders, including the Craft Council of Ireland, jewellery producers and retailers and the Irish Assay Office, on the proposal to amend the Hallmarking Act 1981.  I assure the House that there is no question about the openness of the Minister to having further consultations that people might require and to responding to any concerns that might arise in advance of Committee Stage.  I thank Deputies Lawless and Quinlivan again for contributing to this informative and useful debate.  As I have indicated, the Minister is looking forward to working with Deputies during the Committee and Report Stage debates on this Bill and to considering any amendments that might be proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600029#BB00200","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1491491400,"counter":255,"content":"<p>The gestation period for the Bill may have been very long, but the debate on it certainly has not been.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600029#BB00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1491491400,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Indeed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600029#BB00400","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491491400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Hallmarking (Amendment) Bill 2016: Referral to Select Committee","time":1491491400,"counter":258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600029#BB00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1491491400,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(a) and 149(1).<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600029#BB00700","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491491400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491491400,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.15 p.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1491491700,"counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600030#DD00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Funding","time":1491491700,"counter":264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600030#DD00150"},{"type":"question","time":1491491700,"counter":265,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[17119\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600030#DD00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his Department's engagement with the European Strategic Investment Fund on social housing PPP investment; and his views on whether the finance for the 2,500 social homes submitted to the Department of Finance task force can be attained through these sources.

In that context, a submission has been made through the NDFA to the European Investment Bank, EIB, seeking finance from the European Fund for Strategic Investment to support the provision of some 1,500 social housing units under the social housing PPP programme.  The submission, which is being appraised by the EIB, is in respect of a framework loan to provide financing to private sector partners to construct, finance, operate and maintain the housing units concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The EIB is further involved in supporting social housing Ireland through loan finance provided through the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  On 2 March 2017, I announced a new &euro;200 million long-term loan which has been agreed between the EIB and the HFA.  The combined package, including matching funding provided by the HFA, is &euro;405 million.  The new loan is to support construction of an estimated 1,400 new homes and the refurbishment of more than 700 properties in Dublin and other locations across Ireland.

I am acutely aware of the significant public infrastructure deficit across the country, the lack of capital investment over the past number of years and how economic productivity has been held back as a result.  The most important area is housing, an area where there is a crisis.  It is immoral that the State is leaving millions of euro on the table for European investment banks which is earmarked for investment in public infrastructure under the Juncker plan.  My belief is that the risk aversion of the Government to PPP rather than constraints proposed by the fiscal rules is holding this back.<\/p>  <p>  The fiscal rules are the greatest barrier to increased State investment in infrastructure.  However, the European Commission Juncker plan to enable Government flexibility rather than the application of fiscal rules would promote investment in areas such as social housing.  Yet in Ireland, the only public infrastructure projects being built and financed under the Juncker plan are 14 primary care units.<\/p>  <p>  We need to think outside the box.

A European fund is targeted at investment across the European Union to improve competitiveness and increase economic activity.  That is the whole point of the Juncker plan.

The previous Government faced the same challenges.<\/p>  <p>  As our economy recovers, and as tax revenues improve and the tightness of the fiscal constraints within which we have to operate loosen, undoubtedly that will mean increased expenditure on targeted capital projects.  Access to money is not the problem, whether it involves the EIB, private investors or equity funds.  The challenge is being able to spend money under the fiscal rules.  Borrowing money is not an expensive business for a Government.  Being able to spend it under the rules we have signed up to is the challenge.  That is why PPPs are potentially a very useful mechanism to put in place commercial investments, along with private sector interests.  We are considering the ways in which can be facilitated.<\/p>  <p>  It is also probably true to say that the cost of PPPs today is significantly less than it might have been ten or 15 years ago in terms of the cost of finance.

We have already committed &euro;5.35 billion in our investment programme for social housing which will contribute an extra 47,000 social houses units to the social housing stock in the next four to four and half years.<\/p>  <p>  To put that into context, it will increase our social housing stock by nearly 30% over a four-year period.

Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities.  However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  I have asked my Department to develop proposals for the preparation of a consolidated rates Bill to modernise and consolidate the legislation in this area.

I accept that prices are increasing at a rate that is not sustainable over a prolonged period but the core response to that must be to dramatically increase supply, in particular where people are looking to buy or rent homes.<\/p>  <p>  A chronic undersupply of housing, over a number of years and across all tenures, is at the heart of the problems in the housing sector.  Housing output fell by more than 90% from peak construction levels of more than 93,000 homes in 2006, which was a crazy number, to just over 8,300 new units in 2013.  Rebuilding Ireland targets the accelerated and increased supply of housing with the aim of reaching an annual supply of at least 25,000 well planned, high-quality, socially integrated and affordable homes per year.<\/p>  <p>  While I am aware of recent reports on house prices, average prices are still well below the peak levels recorded in 2007, according to the CSO's residential property price index.  The key now is to achieve the continued increase in supply of new homes at affordable prices.  While I have no plans at this stage to introduce a new affordable housing scheme, although we are working on affordable rental schemes, the range of measures being put in place under Rebuilding Ireland is designed to increase supply significantly and deliver housing at more affordable price points.  For example, last week's announcement of a significant funding package of &euro;226 million for enabling infrastructure under the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, will help to support the provision of more affordable housing in the areas concerned, which have the potential to yield 23,000 new homes by 2021.  A further important measure involves the greater use of State lands for mixed tenure housing delivery and considerable work is under way, in particular with the Dublin local authorities, to bring forward well-considered development proposals on a range of sites.  The help-to-buy scheme is a limited intervention targeted at new builds only and is designed to encourage additional supply by the construction sector.<\/p><p>The scheme falls within the remit of my colleague at the Department of Finance.

In recent days, Philip Lane told the finance committee that house prices are increasing to an extent that only people on high incomes can afford them.  In this regard, the actions taken in the budget in respect of the help-to-buy scheme have exacerbated the situation for many people.  Does the Minister accept this is fuelling house prices?

It is important to put the help-to-buy scheme in context.  In the last quarter of last year 3,005 purchases were made by first-time buyers.  Of these, only 297, fewer than 10%, were new homes.  Given the fact that first-time buyers make up only approximately 25% of the market this means we are speaking about 2.5% of purchases.  I do not accept the idea this is driving up house prices.<\/p>  <p>  The whole point of the help-to-buy scheme is this time last year builders were simply not building homes for first-time buyers because they knew first-time buyers did not have the capacity to put together a deposit, which is something to which the Deputy referred at the start of her contribution.  Houses were expensive and the obligations on first-time buyers to put together deposits made it impossible for most of them to aspire to buy a home.  The Central Bank and the Government came to the same conclusion because of the same evidence, that actually we needed to help first-time buyers to get a deposit together while at the same time limiting the amount of money a first-time buyer could borrow, linked to income.  The net effect of the help-to-buy scheme has been to change the dynamics in the market and we are now seeing a lot more starter homes being built.  Unfortunately, this takes time to impact positively on the market in terms of increased supply, but if we look at commencements, planning permissions and activity in the sector we are seeing significant increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600032#FF00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491492900,"counter":289,"content":"<p>The lack of availability of affordable building land is a factor in this, as is the potential for land hoarding.

That is why they have been allocated up to &euro;1 billion of the spend of the &euro;5.5 billion to make this happen.  There is great opportunity in Tipperary and in many other counties to tap into and work with approved housing bodies, exactly as the Deputy says.  That is something we are very strongly supporting and encouraging.  Our message to all local authorities is to strengthen that relationship at management level and also at local authority representative level, and for the councils to feel part of that and closer to the approved housing bodies.<\/p>  <p>  In the status report to the end of 2016 for social housing construction projects, which was recently published and is on the website, there are 16 projects of various scale for the Tipperary County Council area, either recently completed or being advanced.  Three of these are being advanced by approved housing bodies to deliver 20 units of accommodation at Fethard, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir.  Further projects are being added to this list on an ongoing basis, as they are developed by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Funding is in place for all of these projects and I am keen that they are advanced as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, almost &euro;3 million has been provided to 12 approved housing bodies for Tipperary projects under our Department&rsquo;s capital assistance scheme, to build or acquire houses and apartments as part of sheltered housing projects, with 29 units delivered.  Under my Department&rsquo;s social housing current expenditure programme, two approved housing bodies are managing seven leased units in Tipperary.  There are also approvals in place with two approved housing bodies, via the capital advance leasing facility, for 54 new social units in Tipperary across four projects.<\/p>  <p>  Approved housing bodies have an important role to play under Rebuilding Ireland, with the capacity to contribute around a third of the 47,000 new social housing units targeted over the period to 2021, using a range of delivery methods.  As with all local authorities, we would encourage Tipperary County Council to work constructively with the range of local and national approved housing bodies that operate in the county.  More progress on this by the local authority can result in better social housing delivery.  For example, the repair and leasing scheme, rolled out on a national basis in February, offers a significant opportunity for collaboration with approved housing bodies to maximise the potential impact of the scheme. We hope to see Tipperary County Council working with approved housing bodies on this and other social housing programmes to further improve delivery.

My Department published a comprehensive list of all social housing construction schemes that were advancing nationwide at end of the fourth quarter of 2016.  Over 500 approved schemes were listed that, when completed, will deliver about 8,500 new social homes.  The schemes listed include those that are being designed, those currently on site and those completed in 2016.  It showed that just over 650 new social houses were built in 2016 and a further 90 schemes, delivering over 1,800 newly built social houses, went on site last year.  I am keen that those schemes, which are already approved by my Department, are advanced as soon as possible by the local authorities and approved housing bodies.  I have assured them that funding is in place to support this delivery.  I have also continued to approve further schemes which are adding to the already strong pipeline.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities are taking other actions to respond to housing need and meet the needs of homeless people within their areas.  These include targeted acquisitions, the new repair and leasing initiative, and rapid-delivery housing.  On the latter, my Department is working closely with local authorities and, as well as the 350 rapid-build homes at various stages of progress at end of last year, a further 650 will be advanced in 2017, followed by 500 additional units in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that official homelessness data reports are produced using the pathway accommodation and support system, PASS, the single integrated national data information system on State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements overseen by housing authorities.  These data reports are published and made available on my Department's website each month.<\/p>  <p>  As late as last week, as the Deputy knows, we announced a significant funding package for parts of County Kildare to cover infrastructure that is needed to open up housing sites in the right locations.

However, the housing shortage in County Kildare is reaching a position we have not experienced previously.  Numerous families are apparently becoming homeless at the same time.  On a daily basis, three, four, five or six families report to the local authority begging for accommodation.  The local authority is not in a position to build houses overnight.<\/p>  <p>  Using Kildare as an example, perhaps the Minister might make contact with each of the local authorities with a view to identifying how, using modular houses or by whatever means, they can expand the number of houses available in the short term.  The problem is with the short term; in two years, we will not have the same problem because building will have caught up with it.  However, at the moment we have a serious situation that I have not experienced in my lifetime heretofore.  We have all spoken about this issue in this House with the Minister and his predecessor.

We should not forget there was virtually no money for social housing for quite some time because the country had no money.  We did not have the capacity to borrow money to spend on social housing because there were strings attached to how we sourced finance.  We are no longer in that position.  We have an obligation to increase our housing stock significantly.  I intend doing that as fast as we can while ensuring we have good-quality social housing.  That is why we significantly increased funding this year over last year.  We have seen a 50% increase in housing funding in one year.  We will see another dramatic increase next year and the year after.  We are ramping up.

There is an urgent requirement to contact each local authority, particularly in the greater Dublin area, to identify precisely what they can deliver in the next six months.

Free financial and legal advice is available as well as a revamped mortgage-to-rent scheme.  The supports that are available are much better than before.  We are also starting to see houses being built again and in the kind of numbers that are starting to move towards meeting demand.  We have gone from 12,500 houses two years ago to just over 15,000 houses last year.  There will probably be around 19,000 this year.

I will take, for example, a soft balloon that one might find when cleaning up the day following a party.  If, when messing with it, one were to block the air on one side of it, all the air would go into the other side of it and make it burst.  This is exactly what is happening the areas outside the rent pressure zones.  I have spoken in the House about bus workers before.  They do not earn a huge amount of money.  I know of a bus worker who lives just outside Navan and has been told by his landlord that his rent is going from &euro;800 a month to &euro;1,500 in one fell swoop.  He cannot afford to stay there.

In one electoral area in my constituency, there is an extensive rural area as well as the most expensive rental properties which are at the edge of the city.  I think the same applies in Waterford.

I take Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's point about areas that are contiguous to rent pressure zones.  There may be spillover in terms of landlords feeling that perhaps they are next and that they, therefore, need to put rents up.  There are laws in place, however, that prevent them doing that outside of certain parameters.  If landlords carry out a rent review and seek to increase the rent, they must get reference rents from similar properties in the area.  If tenants are not happy, they can go to the Residential Tenancies Board for a determination of what is fair.  This is why we have the Residential Tenancies Act, which was introduced by my predecessor.<\/p>  <p>  Rent pressure zones were quite a blunt tool.  To zone areas and limit rent increases in those areas by law had never been done by an Irish Government before.

I know the Deputy agrees with this.  In this regard, action 5.1 commits to the development of a national vacant housing reuse strategy that will be informed by census 2016 data to inform the compilation of a register of vacant units across the country; identify the number, location and reasons for longer-term vacancies which are more than six months in high demand areas; and set out a range of actions to bring vacant units back into use.  As I referenced at a meeting in Wicklow last week, we have had vacant properties for 15 or 20 years in the country as recorded in the past three or four censuses.  There is a long-term reason behind some of them.  We are trying to get an understanding of that as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the strategy, established a working group in September 2016 comprising\u00a0senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and the Housing Agency itself to inform the strategy.  The working group has met more than six times to date and is at present concluding its deliberations on\u00a0recommendations to be incorporated in the strategy, with a view to facilitating and incentivising the greater reutilisation of vacant properties.<\/p><p>To assist in the finalisation of the strategy broad consultations\u00a0were undertaken with a range of key stakeholders involved in the housing and homelessness areas as well as local authorities.\u00a0 This scale of engagement and the level of detail involved, including through\u00a0several bilateral\u00a0meetings with stakeholder groups,\u00a0took time to organise but was considered crucial to informing the\u00a0strategy.\u00a0 This is one of the reasons for the delay.  It is also considered\u00a0prudent to await the final census 2016 report on housing, which is due to be published on 20 April, to ensure the most up-to-date data\u00a0on housing is incorporated in the strategy.  Against that background, it is intended that the strategy will be finalised and published next month.<\/p> <p> More than 7,000 public housing voids have been returned to use in recent years at considerable cost.  It is important to note that voids have almost become a thing of the past.  Every local authority has stepped up to the plate to bring voids back into use.  Deputy Casey will be aware that the Department announced two schemes ahead of the announcement of the full strategy.  These are the repair and leasing initiative and the buy and renew scheme.  The Deputy attended a meeting last week in Wicklow at which I stressed that these schemes provide local authorities an immense opportunity to step up and get vacant properties back into use.  Further schemes will be announced but the two to which I have referred are ideal for addressing the issue the Deputy raises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600037#LL02000","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491496500,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The latest census figures indicate there are 260,000 vacant properties in the State.  This figure does not include properties above commercial properties which are not already residential.  The overall figure, therefore, is substantially higher than 260,000.  Even if 2% of these vacant properties were returned to use, we would have 7,500 more homes available.  The Department has provided &euro;32 million to deliver 800 homes.  We would need a fund of only &euro;300 million to deliver 7,500 homes.  We should revisit this issue because vacant properties provide a much quicker solution to the housing and homelessness crisis than new builds.  They also offer an easy win for all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600038#MM00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1491496500,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I fully agree with the Deputy.  Preliminary data from the census indicate there are approximately 200,000 vacant properties when holiday homes are excluded.

We are putting processes in place.  We held two workshops, engaged with all the local authorities and met their chief executives and asked them to pursue vacant properties.  The funding and schemes to do so are in place and an additional &euro;32 million has been allocated to the repair and lease-back initiative this year.  This could bring more than 1,000 properties into use because the figures the Deputy cited assume full cost.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will make it as easy as possible to bring vacant properties into use.  For example, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, recently announced another scheme to tackle vacant properties.  The Housing Agency is trying to purchase more than 400 vacant properties and has been provided with a budget of &euro;70 million, of which &euro;60 million could be spent on the properties it has viewed thus far.  Much is being done in this area and the Department is open to doing more but we need local authorities to engage.  I cannot stress enough that local authority members have an opportunity to find vacant properties, bring them into the system and make them available.

Vacant properties have water and sewerage services and access to the road network.  I ask the Minister to revisit this issue and find more money to address vacant properties.  To use the Department's figures, the &euro;300 million sum provided to deliver 7,500 vacant properties into use is less than what is being spent on rapid build housing, which will deliver only 350 units.

I urge the Minister to ensure the strategy he is finalising is much more ambitious in terms of the number of units being targeted.  Additional resources, particularly staffing, must be provided to local authorities to enable them to go after these units and return them to use.  This approach would secure many more units at a far better price.<\/p>  <p>  If one contrasts the 6,600 units the Minister plans to return to use over five or six years with the 40,000 units targeted under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, it shows the Department's priorities are wrong.

We also asked them to be ambitious and go after these properties.  Three schemes have been announced and money has been allocated to them.  More will follow when the strategy is published.

For as long as I remember, the problem with the rental market is that rents rapidly increase in boom times and collapse at times of recession.  This is no way to manage a rental market in which we want to create security of tenure and much more predictability and certainty for tenants and landlords.  We recognise that many people do not want to live in one location or in a house with a significant amount of debt attached to it for the rest of their lives.  Some people want temporary accommodation because of where they want to work and live.  Some will choose to rent for a lifetime because they want to avoid significant debt.  Those who want to do this should have the option.  We are not trying to encourage this option.<\/p>  <p>  Home ownership is a core part of the Irish mentality and approach to property.<\/p> <p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>There is nothing wrong with that but we want people to have options and, in the past, the rental market was only an option for people who were looking for temporary accommodation, students or those who could not afford their own home.  That has changed a great deal over the past ten years, particularly in Dublin.  It is the norm in many other European capitals.  We are trying in the new rental strategy to provide a much more balanced, predictable rental market that has higher quality and that has good regulation for both tenants and landlords.  We are making that change but it will not happen overnight, mainly because many landlords only have one property and they are not used to the regulation that comes with being a landlord.<\/p> <p> The role of the RTB, particularly in the rental strategy, is being significantly enhanced.  Unlike many other countries, we essentially have a rent regulator.  We are significantly strengthening the RTB by increasing its staff numbers and the resources that go with that.  Since the number of RPZs increased before Christmas, there has been a 135% increase in the number of people contacting the board, often just for information to understand new rules, laws and so on.  We have an evolving but improving rental market, which is moving in the right direction in respect of security of tenure, predictability and certainty in order that people have the option of staying in that market for a long period if that is what they want and if that suits their lifestyle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600038#MM01000","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491497100,"counter":414,"content":"<p>We are out of time but I will allow the Deputy and Minister to contribute again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600039#NN00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1491497100,"counter":415,"content":"<p>We are out of time but the Minister is continuously taking 45 seconds more to answer most of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600039#NN00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1491497100,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I am just trying to give complete answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600039#NN00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1491497100,"counter":417,"content":"<p>The Chair governs those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600039#NN00500","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1491497100,"counter":418,"content":"<p>The Minister took an additional 50 seconds to give that reply.

I believe negotiations have taken place and some matters have been resolved but I commend the players for bringing this to public attention.  It just goes to show when people link with a union and bring issues to public attention the progress that can be made quickly.  However, a broader issue has been revealed, which is the discrimination against, and unequal treatment of, women in sport generally, both nationally and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  I used to coach a basketball team when I was a teacher and the practice was that teachers would bring home the squad's kit to wash.  The kit would be shared among the various teams.  It seems our national women's soccer team was not treated much better having to change in toilets and taking off their tracksuits to give to the underage teams.  There is still a massive difference in the remuneration of women and men.  I understand the women were seeking &euro;300 per match appearance whereas the senior men receive approximately &euro;5,000 per game.<\/p>  <p>  Many surveys highlight that female athletes are covered less in the media now than they were in 1989.  We are subsidising RTE.  Will the Minister of State launch an investigation into the coverage of women's sports by the national broadcaster?  In the US, women's sports receive 3.2% of network coverage although in some cases it is only 2%.  However, many of the television channels use the ubiquitous evolving rolling ticker at the bottom of the screen to justify coverage of women's sport.  Much of the coverage is sexist referring to their looks and appearance and it idealises their ability to juggle family and sport.  One tennis player was asked by a commentator recently to give a twirl to show what she was wearing.  That is the way women can be treated when they participate in sport.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to funding of sports bodies, will the Minister of State call any of them to account regarding the amount they give to women's sports?  This is not just about gender discrimination; it is also a health issue.  How is it attractive for young girls to continue in their chosen sport if they know they will be treated as second or third class citizens?  There is a problem with girls participating in sports in their teenage years and beyond.  Why would they when their participation is not valued at all by society?  There is a health issue for girls.  The Minister of State should call the sports bodies to account in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The prize fund for the World Cup was &euro;576 million whereas the prize fund for the Women's World Cup was &euro;15 million, or 40 times less.  The men's World Cup winning team received $35 million whereas the women's winners received $2 billion.  The winning team in the men's UEFA Champions League receives &euro;15 million while the winning women's team receives &euro;250,000 or 60 times less.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the State gave &euro;2.96 million to the GAA but only &euro;384,655 was given to the Ladies Gaelic Football Association and &euro;387,000 to the Camogie Association.  Much less funding goes to women's sports and the Minister of State should take this up with the association.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600039#NN02400","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1491497100,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the events of the past few days.  Like most Members, I am delighted the issues between the women's teams and the FAI have been resolved, training has recommenced and the scheduled match will go ahead next Monday evening.  I wish the team the best of luck.<\/p><p>Over the past number of years, we have seen huge strides being made by our women's international soccer team and I wish them the best of luck.<\/p> <p> I understand all of the issues raised by the women's team have been successfully resolved following mediation last night.  I made contact yesterday morning with Sport Ireland and the FAI and I encouraged both to facilitate mediation.  I was delighted it was availed off by all parties without preconditions and that the matters have been resolved.<\/p> <p> It is disappointing the dispute between the team and the FAI happened in the first place but I am pleased that it has now been resolved.  It is important that woman and girls are encouraged to participate in sport and I am fully supportive of the existing programmes in place aimed at increasing female participation in sport.  Football plays an important role in that regard.  Women&rsquo;s participation in football has been growing in recent years and I know it will continue.  Since the launch of the FAI's women&rsquo;s development plan in 2006, the number of registered players in the women&rsquo;s game has grown from 12,500 to more than 23,000.  It is a clear indication of the huge increase and interest in women&rsquo;s football and I have no doubt the part played by the women&rsquo;s national team and members of that squad acting as ambassadors and role models has been a huge factor in the growth in participation.<\/p> <p> I take this opportunity to congratulate the team on securing fourth spot in the Cyprus Cup last month, their highest ever finish in a tournament.<\/p> <p> Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department as a statutory agency, provides funding to the FAI from its youth field sports programme and its women in sport programme, which I launched yesterday for 2017.  Funding of &euro;2.7 million was provided to the FAI last year.  Youth field sports funding is aimed at increasing participation in football by young people, both boys and girls.  The women in sport funding is for the grassroots development of specific programmes in women&rsquo;s football and funds participation initiatives for women.  The FAI's individual programmes are aimed at encouraging young girls aged between seven and 12 to play football.  The programme has been a major factor in the increase in the number of young girls participating in recent years.  Over 130 soccer sisters camps will be taking place around the country during the upcoming Easter school holidays.  We have seen programmes like these with the GAA c&uacute;l camps.  Programmes like this are a great way to get young girls involved in sport and I commend the FAI for the work it is doing.<\/p> <p> Since this Government came into office, we have put a number of initiatives in place such as funding for the women's GPA.  References were made to women's sports in general.  Funding is now in place when it previously was not.  The Women's Rugby World Cup is coming up in the summer.  I will use the opportunity to promote that and hope people engage in it.  We have also seen improvements in the broadcast of women's sports, particularly in the Women's Six Nations.  This has to be welcomed.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to the GAA.  I remind the Deputy the GAA has responsibility for handball and underage hurling and football in our schools and it does not discriminate between boys and girls.  Many clubs across the country have, at underage level such as under-eights, under-tens and under-12s, boys and girls playing together.  The GAA has a programme for the development of women in the sport.  It needs to be acknowledged in terms of the overall contribution the GAA makes.  The IRFU has a similar situation as do most of the national governing bodies that come under the umbrella of Sport Ireland.  Sport Ireland has specific programmes for the development of women's sports, the funding of which we announced yesterday.  The allocations will be made through the national governing bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600039#NN02500","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491497700,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State find it acceptable that the head of the FAI is apparently on a salary of &euro;360,000 yet failed to engage and did not want to engage at all with representatives of the women players for a number of years?  The Minister of State is saying it is great that it was sorted out.  Is there not some responsibility on him as Minister of State to call the FAI to account for its treatment of these players over a long period of time?  They should not have had to go public.  They should not have had to do what they did.  It obviously took a huge amount of work.  It did not just happen with the press conference.  They should not have had to threaten to go on strike.  It validates the power of withdrawing labour and the reason why people resort to it.  Does the Minister of State not think the FAI has to be called to account for its finances in general?  There have been ongoing issues with what seems to be first class travel by the top executives while the players are stuck in economy class.  It also happened with the men's team but obviously it would be even worse for the women's team.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of broader issues here.  We know there is gender inequality in sport.  It is massive.  My daughter has often asked me why they never show women playing sport on television.  How is it possible to encourage daughters to take part in sport when they see they are not valued?  RTE's director general mooted the idea of doubling the TV licence as something she would like to do.  We see very few women in TV coverage generally but even fewer in sport.

It is extremely important that the project to provide additional permanent accommodation should be progressed without further delay.  I am privileged to be very familiar with this school, having visited the premises for different events on numerous occasions.  I appreciate the work of Rachel Moynagh, the principal and all her staff, colleagues, successive boards of management and parents' associations.  There is a real school community for the Holy Family.  This project has the support of all Oireachtas Members and county councillors throughout Cavan-Monaghan.<\/p>  <p>  For some time the Department has accepted this major building project for the Holy Family school is a priority to progress to tender and construction stage.  The project was authorised to proceed to complete stage 2B of architectural planning on 31 January 2017.  The initial feasibility study for this new school accommodation was carried out in 2002 and the design team was appointed in 2006.  For various reasons delays have occurred.  Increased enrolments and changes to the schedules of accommodation were some of the reasons cited at the time for delays occurring in the early stages of the planning process.  It was back to the drawing board on a number of occasions.  Very importantly, since 2002, the school population has doubled in size and school facilities are totally inadequate to meet the needs of the pupils.  Currently the school is on two sites and the pupils attending the White Star complex in Market Street in the town lose considerable time when they go to the main building for lunch.<\/p><p>They must travel by bus.  Lack of space in both buildings is a major issue.  For example, one class is in the PE storeroom and includes four wheelchair users.<\/p> <p> The board of management does not want to have to introduce waiting lists for the first time in the school's history.  It is the only such school in Cavan-Monaghan.  If it is not possible to accommodate all children who need to attend the Holy Family Special School, serious problems will arise for those with moderate, severe and-or profound disabilities in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Children who need to attend this school must not be deprived of that opportunity.<\/p> <p> Over the years, successive parents associations and boards of management have been supportive of the principal and staff in fund-raising for the school and participating in numerous events and activities involving all of the school community.  The board and its professional advisers are anxious that the Minister and his Department should permit it without further delay to start the pre-qualification of contractors and let construction commence during 2017.<\/p> <p> Regarding the growth in enrolments, there were 14 school leavers in the 2015-16 year whereas there were 34 school admissions.  This school was started more than 50 years ago.  One of our predecessors in the House, Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, was one of its founding members.  It is important that the Minister gives the go ahead to ensure that construction commences during 2017.  The school sought and was granted planning permission last year for temporary accommodation that would enable it to move site this summer so that construction could start on the main site before the end of the year.  The board of management, the parents' association and the wider school community are frustrated by the delays.  It is important that the requisite approval be issued at the earliest possible date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600040#OO02200","speaker":"1270","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491498300,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Smyth a brief intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600041#PP00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1491498300,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I support my colleague in calling on the Minister to approve this project.

Its pupils have severe and profound learning difficulties, moderate and multiple learning disabilities, and-or autism.  On Monday, there were major protests across the country regarding access to services for parents and, more importantly, special needs students.<\/p>  <p>  The project is an important infrastructural one that needs to happen.

The school is successful and no one doubts its quality.  As Deputy Brendan Smith stated, it saw a dramatic increase in enrolments.<\/p>  <p>  I have examined the history of the project.  To be fair, the delay has been for good reason, in that the board of management requested the addition of five permanent classrooms, increasing the school's size from 21 classrooms.  This meant that the design needed to be amended and a fresh planning application had to be obtained, given that the floor area was increasing to 5,300 sq. m.  A replacement consultant mechanical and electrical engineer also had to be appointed to the design team.<\/p>  <p>  The school raised the issue of how the children would be decanted.  The original plan would have entailed two phases and the decant would not have been on the same scale, but there will now be a total decant of the school.  A design for that has been approved and will form part of the overall contract.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is awaiting the stage 2B submission from the school.  Moving to that detailed design stage was approved in January.  The Department must receive and assess the submission.  Deputy Brendan Smith suggested that contractors be pre-qualified before that point.  I will ask my Department whether that is feasible, but I imagine that the design would have to be defined before pre-qualification could occur.  Perhaps that is not the case, but I will check it out for the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  As soon as the school's submission is received, we will attempt to move on it as quickly as possible.

Emily was brain damaged at birth.  She cannot walk, talk, eat or do anything for herself.  She is also incontinent.  Emily's hearing is exceptionally good but her sight is not.  She attends school in Dungarvan and she is looked after very well in St. John's on a weekly basis.  Emily lives at home with her mum, her dad and her three year old brother.  She has to be lifted multiple times a day and, if sick, she has to be lifted a great deal more.  She has a standing appliance, a walker, a comfort chair and a wheelchair but she needs to be lifted and carried from these appliances several times a day.  She also requires physiotherapy every day as her hands are permanently fisted and her hips are very tight and rigid.  Emily has no freedom of movement and her muscles spasm regularly so physiotherapy is vital to her in her life.  Ideally this should be done on a flat surface and so Emily's mum normally does it on the floor.  However, her mum is no longer able to lift Emily from the floor as she now has severe back pain.<\/p>  <p>  Emily's needs are a constant physical strain on her family.  As I said, her physiotherapy is now carried out while she is on a bed, which unfortunately is not as beneficial or effective but the family has no choice.  Emily's mum has been fighting for a ceiling hoist for Emily since last summer.  A floor hoist was offered by the HSE but it will not work for the family because it will not fit into Emily's room.  Emily's mum advised the HSE that the floor hoist would not work.  She understands that the ceiling hoist is more expensive - it is approximately double the &euro;1,300 cost of the floor hoist, at &euro;2,700 - and she is willing to meet some of the cost.  We have hit a brick wall.  Regardless of where we turn the answer continues to be that the floor hoist is the only appliance that can be provided for Emily.  To add to this, the liaison nurse who attends the family and Emily has been advised by her employers, the HSE, not to lift Emily and so she is no longer attending her.  This is extremely upsetting for Emily and her family.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, I take no pleasure in raising this matter on the floor of the House.  I acknowledge that there is a lot of good work being done but we are continually meeting a brick wall on this matter.  This ceiling hoist, that would run from the bedroom to the bathroom, would enable Emily to be easily moved to and from all of her appliances.  This would make life so much easier for her family.  Approximately &euro;14 billion is spent annually on the health budget.  The amount required for this ceiling hoist is not huge.  I accept the HSE is under constraint in terms of its budget.  The HSE has not refused this hoist on health and safety grounds.  I was actually told by a HSE employee to apply to Waterford City and County Council for a grant for the hoist.  In my view, it is passing responsibility for this matter to Waterford City and County Council and it is not its responsibility. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600042#QQ00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1491498900,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.

The child concerned was clinically assessed by a HSE occupational therapist in Waterford Community Services and it was determined that a standard hoist would meet her needs.  A standard hoist has been offered by the HSE to the child&rsquo;s family.  However, it is understood that they have indicated a preference for a ceiling track hoist.

If she had to be put into State care it would cost a fortune.  Emily's parents are doing their utmost for her every day of the week.  This is a funding issue.  The ceiling hoist is not being refused on health and safety grounds.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned in her reply that ceiling hoist systems are not generally available through HSE Waterford Aids and Appliances but they are available in other counties.  I cannot understand that.  Why this item, which would make Emily's life and that of her parents so much easier, cannot be given to her does not make sense in this day and age.  It is a sad reflection of the society we are living in that a brain damaged child who cannot walk, talk, eat or speak and is incontinent is being refused a ceiling track hoist that would make her life a little easier.  As I said earlier, I take no pleasure in having to raise this matter in the D&aacute;il.  It is wrong that I have to raise on the floor of the D&aacute;il the provision of equipment for a child, which should be a fundamental right.  All Emily's parents want is a normal happy life with their two children, one of whom is, unfortunately, brain damaged.  It would make life so much easier on them to have a ceiling hoist installed.  I have also raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.

It is a small town of just over 2,000 people with a very strong community spirit.  Over the years, we have had more than our fair share of tough times and tribulations.  It has had a high level of unemployment and it continues to have a high level of disadvantage, as evidenced by the fact that all three schools in the town have DEIS status.  The two primary schools in Rathangan are the only two schools in the county that do not have a NEPS service.  Generally speaking, the town has been able to come together to deal with many of the issues it faces.  The fabulous new community centre, which was built with the help of County Kildare Leader Partnership, Kildare County Council and the local community, has certainly been a welcome investment in the town.  It is the home of the local youth caf&eacute;, which is used by the Scooters youth club, For&oacute;ige and other groups that wish to avail of it.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to refer to the bad times we have come through in Rathangan.  In 2012, we suffered the devastating loss of five young men over a very short period.  As Deputies can imagine, this was a particularly high number of fatalities in the context of the population of the town.  Although the people of the town were devastated, they came together as a community with the assistance of Kildare Youth Services, County Kildare Leader Partnership, local schools and local community activists, including myself.  We got a very good response from the HSE, which funded a part-time youth counsellor and a part-time youth worker, who have been working very closely with young people in the community ever since.  Since 31 March, the services of the youth counsellor are no longer being provided.  We have been told that by the end of April, the services of the youth worker will no longer be provided.  I understand that a review is being carried out by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to make an appeal to the Minister of State.  The local community will be totally let down if these vital services, which have given huge support to the younger members of our community, in particular, are withdrawn.  When I looked at the census figures this morning, it was evident that County Kildare has one of the highest youth populations in the country.  There was a big fanfare last week when, thankfully, Tusla granted another youth worker to Kildare.  It is simply not good enough for the State to give with one hand through one agency and to take away with the other hand through a different agency the following week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600043#RR00600","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1491499500,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Loughlin for raising this issue as well.  I will try not to be repetitive.  Scooters youth club was established in Rathangan in 1996 and has flourished with the support of the local community and local businesses since then.  It meets the specific need for such services in this rural part of County Kildare.  Approximately 50 young people access youth services in the town, including those provided by For&oacute;ige.  As Deputy O'Loughlin informed the House, a youth caf&eacute; was established in Rathangan recently.  Most importantly, Scooters youth club has provided a much-needed community response to the deaths of young people that were mentioned by Deputy O'Loughlin, for example, by building youth counselling services with a focus on mental health and well-being.  The youth counselling service has ceased and the services of the youth worker who was allocated to the club for 19 hours a week are set to cease at the end of the month.  This cut will reduce opening hours by 82% to just four hours a week, which is absolutely shocking.<\/p>  <p>  Kildare Youth Services believes these cuts in funding will have a serious impact in the local area, which is already geographically isolated.  The limited transport service in the area makes it more difficult for young people to seek HSE-led services outside Rathangan.  When the national task force on mental health was established by the Government, it was stated that its aim was to bring youth mental health to the fore through our education system.  The Government also made much of its claim that it would prioritise mental health.  We need to be realistic.  Young people deserve this service.  The young people for whom these services were put in place have probably grown up, but a new generation with new challenges has come along.  The removal of these services at this time is like pulling the plug out of a bath after it has been filled up and expecting it not to empty.  Prevention is better than cure.  If these resources are removed now, they will be even more desperately needed in the future.  Those involved with Scooters youth club have made the reasonable request to be part of the conversation about what happens to the club's resources.  They were not consulted.  They want the young people in the area to be asked about this, which is very important.  Consultation should happen.  Under no circumstances should these resources be removed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600043#RR00700","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speech","time":1491499500,"counter":480,"content":"<p>I will read the reply that has been given to me on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, but I do not know whether it will satisfy the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600043#RR00800","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1491499500,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I would say it will not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600043#RR00900","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1491499500,"counter":482,"content":"<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, I had the privilege of bringing children from my own local youth club on holidays to Rathangan on many occasions.  As a result, I know Rathangan very well.  We were always well accepted by the community even though we were from the inner city.  We always gelled with the people there.  It was a lovely place to go.  Even though it was not a very long drive to Rathangan, for many children from the inner city it felt like they were going to the other side of the world.  I have been familiar with Rathangan for many years and I continue to be familiar with it.<\/p>  <p>  After I have read the response that has been prepared on behalf of the Minister of State, I will reply to some of the issues that have been raised by the Deputies on the basis of the notes I have taken.  The HSE has indicated that funding to Kildare Youth Services will not be cut this year.  Kildare Youth Services, in consultation with the HSE, will review the current provision of services in Rathangan.  As the Deputies indicated, this initiative was funded as a result of a number of suicides in the area and as an acknowledgment of the lack of relevant supports and services to young people in the community generally.  The funding will be reviewed to enable equity of access to other groups across the Kildare region and to ensure that those who most need services can access them.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is providing funding to Kildare Youth Services for a counsellor and a youth worker in Rathangan to provide dedicated youth counselling sessions to individuals and groups in the town.  This is being done as part of an inter-agency approach to the promotion of positive mental health, involving community leaders, schools, parents and students.  The agencies in question include the HSE, Kildare Youth Services, County Kildare Leader Partnership, the Garda, Kildare County Council and Mental Health Ireland.  The objectives of this initiative were to establish contact with individuals, families and community-based organisations, especially in estates and localities where residents and families may experience social exclusion or feel disconnected from the wider Rathangan community.  It developed links with local service providers, including schools and relevant statutory services, to assist in the initial contact programme and to co-ordinate appropriate agency interventions based on identified local needs.  Kildare Youth Services is a voluntary organisation providing a range of development and learning opportunities and services throughout the county to respond to the changing needs of young people, families and communities.  It supports personal and social development and positively promotes the rights of these groups.  The HSE is funding Kildare Youth Services to provide a counsellor and a youth worker in Rathangan.  The youth worker, who works part-time three days each week, runs groups for young people between the ages of 11 and 18.  I know some of this might be irrelevant now.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Government launched Connecting for Life, which is the national strategy to reduce suicide and self-harm over the period from 2015 to 2020.  The strategy sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being on many fronts.  It provides community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention.  One of the main goals of Connecting for Life is to target approaches among priority groups, including young people.  This objective, along with the type of work being undertaken by this particular service in Rathangan, is complemented in a wider sense by the ongoing work of the national task force on youth mental health, which was established by this Government.  This has brought together different perspectives and insights from the public, private, community and voluntary sectors and is operating as an action-oriented, decision-making group focused on making improvements and getting things done.  An overriding objective of the task force, which is chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is to identify areas where services and supports could be provided in a more integrated way.  I have listened to the Deputies and I will respond to what they have said in my concluding remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600043#RR01000","speaker":"1307"},{"type":"speech","time":1491499500,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Buckley for his support on this important issue.

They have taken on different community projects.  I dread to think what will happen to the youth cafe which, thanks to the State and funding from Kildare County Council, has been provided.<\/p> <p> It is ridiculous that the State would provide one level of support but not another.

I am disappointed with the answer.  I plead with the Minister of State to tread carefully and convey a message to the Minister of State and HSE when she is thinking of reducing or relocating any services for the young people of Rathangan.<\/p> <p> The service is running a programme to allow young people to become leaders.  One youth leader, Evan, said: \"There is not enough people harming themselves in Rathangan.  Is that why they took away the services?

It contains seven different limitation periods of one, two, three, six, 12, 30 and 60 years, all applying to different types of civil actions.

Its aim is to reduce the current time limit from six years to two years in the case of a civil claim based on a contract debt such as a loan from a bank.  The Bill also seeks to reduce the lifetime of High Court and Circuit Court judgments from 12 to two years, which would be in line with the most recent bankruptcy legislation.<\/p><p>The Bill is guided by a report produced by the Law Reform Commission in December 2011 on the limitation of actions which states that:<\/p><blockquote>[T]he rationale for applying different limitation periods depending on the type of action is no longer clear.

This is a waste of time and resources in our already backlogged court system.<\/p><p>Common law actions, which include claims relating to contracts, including debt-related claims, and torts, including personal injury actions, make up a large portion of the civil cases taken in Irish courts, accounting for 45.5% of all civil claims in 2010.  Reducing the limitation period would reduce litigation costs and the costs on the defendant and, given that the judicial process receives public subsidies, there would be a reduction in costs to the taxpayer.<\/p><p>Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights states that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.  This right is aimed at preventing the parties involved from living too long under the stress of uncertainty, and to ensure that justice is carried out without delays which could threaten its effectiveness.<\/p><p>With regard to the question of what length of time is reasonable, the Law Reform Commission in its 2011 report cites legal analysis relating to Ireland, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, indicating that a two-year uniform limitation period would he the most appropriate in order to satisfy the rights of both parties to a dispute.  The plaintiff must have enough time to consider his or her position, take legal advice, investigate the claim and prepare his or her case, but not so much time that it could put him or her in a position to delay unreasonably.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Civil limitation periods are a common feature of the legal systems of the state parties to the European Convention on Human Rights, although the European Court has noted a lack of uniformity in their duration across member states.  According to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, namely Stubbings <i>v<\/i>. United Kingdom (1997):<\/p><blockquote>They serve ... important purposes, namely to ensure legal certainty and finality, protect potential defendants from stale claims which might be difficult to counter and prevent the injustice which might arise if courts were required to decide upon events which took place in the distant past on the basis of evidence which might have become unreliable and incomplete because of the passage of time.<\/blockquote><p>According to the Law Reform Commission, a fair limitations period would take into account the rights and interests of both the plaintiff and the defendant, while also acting in the public interest.  As we are talking about debt, the reality is that a vulture fund, with seemingly unlimited resources, could take up to six years to decide to take a case against an individual who generally has considerably fewer resources at his or her disposal.  The vulture fund has the resources to prepare its case quickly, but the defendant could be forced to live in fear of the financial and reputational repercussions of the legal action for six years.  Small businesses and home owners could be particularly vulnerable.<br\/><br\/>The Law Reform Commission of Western Australia has found that the &quot;the adverse economic effects on defendants of having potential claims lying around too long can harm the health of the commercial sector generally.&quot;  Every day, families in Ireland are living under a cloud.  They are waiting for a knock on the door, a summons to arrive in the letter box or a call from their solicitor to say that the debt from the past has come back to haunt them and that this will possibly to result in them losing their home.  That could be a debt incurred six years ago and in some cases even longer.  Solicitors have mentioned to me some problems they have encountered in this area, for example, school and college tuition fees for children and pension savings are swallowed up by six and ten-year old debts and families are unable to save, invest or plan for their futures because of the overhang of historical debt and not knowing when the risk will end.<br\/><br\/>Old judgments are often registered as a mortgage on a family home.  In some cases the debt may have been incurred ten years previously and the court proceedings are issued just before the six-year limitation period expires.  The court proceedings take a minimum of 12 months, heaping added cost and misery on a family and the judgment mortgage which follows survives as a legal burden for another 12 years.  In total, one could be looking at a legal sentence on the family of 18 or 19 years.  For many, that is a sentence on an entire generation.<br\/><br\/>The six-year period within which to bring court proceedings has resulted in families and relationships being broken up, has removed any chance of a planned future and has caused distress, illness and, in rare cases, even suicide.  There is a growing market in what is known as bottom feeders who seek to buy up old debts that the banks and other concerns see little point in pursuing after two or three years.  The unscrupulous outfits then take over the debt and threaten litigation within the six-year period and adopt the most aggressive moneylender-type tactics in seeking recovery on the historical debts.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  A six-year period is completely unnecessary as the vast majority of outstanding debts which are the subject of legal proceedings are commenced within two years.  As the vulture funds that stalk this land are aware - and, indeed, as creditors all over the world will testify - old and stale claims that have been in existence for more than two years are very difficult to recover.  Pursuing such old claims often results in no-win situations, as the debtor does not have the money to repay.  And all that happens, therefore, is that the valuable time of the courts has been used up and distress is added to the hapless families.<br\/><br\/>James Treacy, managing director of <i>StubbsGazette, <\/i>recently stated<i><\/i>that recovery of outstanding contract debts is crucial to the efficient operation of our economy and that the key to recovering contract debts is good information and swift action.  The current six-year period contradicts that approach.  The 2011 value-for-money audit carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the legal debt collection process of the Revenue Commissioners arrived at a similar conclusion when it discovered that the most significant returns on court actions for outstanding tax debts were those taken in the early period after the liability is incurred.  Waiting six years to commence action is lazy and oppressive and risks losing the State and creditors enormous sums of money.  In addition, the longer the case is hanging about or delayed, the greater the risk of what is termed &quot;satellite litigation&quot; where other parties become involved and the costs and delays increase further.<br\/><br\/>Modern society and Irish business have instant communications and computerised accounts and do not need the snail's-pace inefficiency and delay of a six-year period.  If the decision to enter into the contract and debt was the correct one at the outset and that debt remains unpaid, that can be acted upon within two years and a six-year period makes no sense.  All citizens have a right to a speedy trial and it is a breach of their fundamental rights to have a cloud hanging over them for an extended period of six years or more.<br\/><br\/>Evidence deteriorates over time and memories dim, which means there is a risk of prejudice against the debtor with delay.  The latter is all because of a laziness and inefficiency on the part of the creditor in not acting promptly to collect the debt.  The cost to the courts and also to individuals and business of maintaining records for six or seven years instead of two years is enormous and unnecessary.  It is phantom work and is completely unproductive.  In many modem economies, the time limit is two or three years because everyone is entitled to have the slate wiped clean and be able to conduct a life that is not filled with the dread of a historical debt being resurrected several years later with little possibility of payment.  In addition, judges find it difficult to imagine the context and circumstance of the original transaction several years previously and that adds to the uncertainty.<br\/><br\/>Exceptions to the proposed two-year rule would be latent or hidden defects that would enable purchasers or users of services or products to avail of a longer period.  It would not be reasonable, for example, if a solicitor acted in the purchase of a home but did not secure proper title and was free of responsibility after a mere two years given that the person would be unlikely to find out until he or she tried to sell the house.  He or she should have potential for redress.  The main purpose of the Bill is that the core limitation period for legal actions on breach of contract should be reduced from six years to two years in the interest of fairness; to reflect modern best practice; to update an archaic but cruel law and to implement the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, addressed some core points relating to the Bill, when she stated:<\/p><blockquote>The operation of the law in relation to the Statute of Limitations is a matter of ongoing review at my Department.  This process also takes account of the Law Reform Commission Report on the Limitation of Actions published in December 2011 (LRC 104 -2011).  In this Report, the Commission expressed the view that the principal legislation governing limitation of actions, the Statute of Limitations 1957 (as amended), is unnecessarily complex and in need of fundamental reform and simplification.  The Commission made a series of recommendations in relation to enhancing the coherence of the broader limitation of actions regime including the introduction of a uniform two-year basic limitation period for common law actions.<br \/><br \/>As part of the ongoing review of the operation of the law in relation to the Statute of Limitations at my Department I will, therefore, continue to take account of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and other relevant developments in the bringing forward of any future proposals for legislation in this area including, possibly, as part of any new programme of legislation.<\/blockquote><p>It is good to see that the Government did not dismiss the proposal out of hand at the time.  She also added that the Law Reform Commission had informed her:<\/p><blockquote>Since the Commission was established in 1975, it has published 117 Reports, and about 70% of these Reports have either been implemented in Acts or are in the process of being implemented in Government Bills (which as you know are the most common way that legislation gets enacted).  This compares very well with other similar law reform agencies around the world, where implementation rates are sometimes between 50%-60%.<\/blockquote><p>It is not as if I picked the Bill from the sky; we followed as closely as we could the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.<\/p><p>It sees a need for change, and we think that given the changing climate in Ireland, particularly following the economic crisis and the banking crisis, which had such a dramatic effect across the board in so many aspects of life in Ireland, business is not the same as before.  I honestly believe it is time for the Government to address this issue.  I admit our Bill is not perfect.  We would be very happy for any of the parties to table amendments to improve it because we accept changes are required.  However, we think in principle it needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600044#SS00700","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491501300,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I am speaking on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets she cannot be present due to official commitments.  I thank Deputy Mick Wallace for introducing the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill 2017.  I also appreciate that his introduction of the Bill draws on experience over the past six years of dealing with people throughout Ireland who are in debt or have a debt hanging over them.  It thus has an overall context related to the management of indebtedness and enforceability of debts.  The key challenge for policy making in these areas is that of balancing the interests and rights of the parties concerned while affording the opportunity for a negotiated rather than an imposed outcome.<\/p>  <p>  Very real concerns have arisen from the structure and varied scope of the Bill in its initial consideration by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Office of the Attorney General, on foot of which the Government has decided to oppose the Bill.  It makes proposals across several fronts, which do not necessarily hang well together.  For example, it is proposed the limitation period, which is generally six years, for bringing a range of contract and tort claims and some other types of claims, including those based on quasi-contract or recognizances and seamen's wages, be reduced to just two years.  There is a proposed exception for personal injuries cases based on negligence, nuisance or breach of statutory duty where the limitation period would be increased from the current two years to three years.  The limitation period for enforcing liabilities arising from a document under seal, an arbitration award or certain company-related debts is to be reduced from 12 to two years.<\/p>  <p>  From these examples, one can see the broad sweep of the Bill's revisions to the limitations regime, many of which do not seem to relate to the key issue of contract debts, which has been highlighted.  A key proposal of Deputy Wallace's Bill, which would have very broad implications, is that the limitation period for enforcing a court judgment of any type is reduced from the current 12 years to just two years.  It is also envisaged that interest may only be claimed on a judgment debt for a maximum of two years from the date on which the interest became due.  Apart from fines for criminal offences, the limitation period for enforcing any penalty or forfeiture sum recoverable by virtue of any enactment is to be reduced to two years.  An apparent anomaly is that while the Bill cuts limitations periods generally, it also provides an exception for slander, where the limitation period would be increased to three years from the current one year period albeit extendable by up to two years by the court.  Nor is it clear why the Bill proposes to extend the limitation period for slander but not for libel, particularly given that the distinction between the two was abolished by the Defamation Act 2009.<\/p>  <p>  Fundamentally, it does not follow, as the Bill suggests, that because the bankruptcy period has been reduced from 12 years to one year there should be commensurate reductions in the periods following which actions in contract or tort law become statute barred.  They are different areas of law, with largely different objectives, rights and legal principles in play.  While it is appreciated that Deputy Wallace would wish to reduce the period under which debtors and others are under the threat of an action, it is considered that the Bill's unilateral and sweeping approach to the reduction of limitation periods on so many fronts at once has the very real potential to have the very opposite effect for various reasons I will outline.<\/p>  <p>  The core of the Government&rsquo;s concerns is that while the proposed Bill would shorten the duration of a potential creditor's action against a debtor it would, by the same token, effectively deprive creditors and debtors of time and options.  That is to say, deprive all parties of any space or reasonable time for a negotiated resolution which can take better account of personal, financial, family or business circumstances.  Such space and time can be to the benefit not only of those seeking payment of moneys owed to them, but also to those who owe such moneys.<\/p>  <p>  If the Bill were implemented as proposed, it would potentially increase pressures on debtors by compelling creditors to take earlier action, that is to say within two years as opposed to six.  It would render creditors less amenable to reaching negotiated agreements with debtors.  Indeed, we would be incentivising the harshest and most immediate of debt enforcement or recovery options.  Putting such pressure on creditors to sue, as would undoubtedly arise, would not, therefore, be in the ease of debtors.  This scenario could also have the effect of drastically increasing the number of actions brought before the courts by creditors who would feel compelled to act immediately.  In short, in so far as debtors are concerned, the Bill as put could well backfire and risks provoking a rapid increase in repossession actions on home mortgage arrears, just as those numbers are falling.<\/p>  <p>  As far as the proposed two-year limitation period proposed by the Bill for the enforcement of a judgment is concerned, this could, in certain circumstances, render a judgment potentially unenforceable.  For example, it could take longer than two years to complete an order for sale on foot of a judgment mortgage of the High Court.  By the same token, there would be a concern as to the effect of such a radically foreshortened limitation period on property rights.  This could well arise where creditors may be denied the time to access information on mortgage default and other relevant issues before taking action.  It is also considered that such a reduction would conflict with the primary objective of the Central Bank's code of conduct for mortgage arrears, which is to assist indebted borrowers in addressing their mortgage debt without the loss of the family home by reducing the time a creditor would have to act to secure the asset.<\/p>  <p>  Another fundamental concern is that the Bill, as it stands, would include within the scope of its potential creditors not just banks or big investment funds but also trade creditors, ranging from large companies to SMEs, which provide goods or services on credit to other businesses or to consumers.  This could impact adversely on them, particularly from an enforcement perspective.  Similar enforcement concerns could also apply to Revenue actions taken before the High Court by the Collector General.  In the current context of Brexit negotiations it is also of concern that the Bill would result in our jurisdiction having a limitation regime markedly different from those of England and Wales under the Limitation Act 1980, and of Northern Ireland under the Limitation (Northern Ireland) Order 1989.  These regimes have core limitation periods of six years, with 12 years for contracts under seal.  By the same token, introducing any unbalanced changes in creditors' rights to enforce loans, particularly ones that could end up being out of step with those applicable in similar jurisdictions, also carries the risk of reducing the willingness of banks to offer credit, particularly mortgages, and that of increasing interest rates.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also fails to acknowledge the relevant provisions of the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 1991 relating to personal injury claims which, as amended by the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, provides for a two year limitation period in personal injury cases in general.  Similarly, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, which seeks to ensure that relevant borrowers such as mortgage holders and SMEs whose loans are sold to third parties maintain the regulatory protections that they enjoyed prior to sale.<\/p><p>In putting forward this Bill, it is argued that reducing the periods after which contract or tort claims become statute-barred would reflect recent changes made in personal insolvency and bankruptcy.  However, this reflects a misunderstanding.  This is particularly so with bankruptcy.  We have reduced the normal bankruptcy period from 12 years down to one year, but it has to be remembered that a person who becomes bankrupt still loses all of his or her assets and surplus income in the process.<br\/><br\/>The comparison with personal insolvency is also amiss.  Far from seeking to compress the period for creditors to take legal action or to enforce debts, personal insolvency provides a court-supervised protected period for negotiations during which creditors cannot issue proceedings or pressurise the debtor.  Personal insolvency also enables courts to adjourn repossession proceedings to facilitate a negotiated settlement.  Despite the unprecedented crisis in personal debt and particularly in home mortgage debt, which still bears heavily on many families, the extensive series of reforms and initiatives put in place by the Government is bearing fruit.  Home mortgage arrears have been falling steadily for 14 consecutive quarters.  Some 121,000 home mortgages have been restructured.  Numbers of repossession orders and of new repossession proceedings are falling significantly.  Almost 6,000 vouchers were issued under the Abhaile mortgage arrears resolution service to borrowers still at risk of losing their homes, for free, independent, expert financial and legal advice.  We have also seen the abolition of the so-called &quot;bank veto&quot; in personal insolvency.  Almost 1,000 applications for personal insolvency arrangements were made in the last quarter of 2016.  The latest sample of concluded personal insolvency arrangements shows that 89% kept the person in his or her home, with another 7% choosing to rent instead.<br\/><br\/>Most recently, reforms have been made to the mortgage to rent scheme, which is working on the ground.  In a recent assessment of solutions available to borrowers, the Central Bank found that &quot;there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process&quot;.  While we still have work to do, it is critically important that these advances and reforms are not undermined by measures which could ramp up pressure on creditors to litigate and enforce rather than to adjourn and negotiate.  For the many reasons I have just outlined, the Government is opposing the proposed Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill.  It is also the view of the Government, in opposing the Bill, that the various, fundamental, cross-cutting and sweeping measures being proposed would need to be considered coherently as part of an overall reform of our limitation of actions regime.  As acknowledged by Deputy Mick Wallace, we have an instrument for such reform in the Law Reform Commission report number 104 of 2011, and its recommendations.  We need to take the kind of approach advocated by the Commission, and look carefully at the potential interactions of measures implemented since 2011.  We must do this so we do not contribute further to the <i>ad hoc<\/i>random and haphazard nature of the current limitations regime that the Law Reform Commission has criticised and is seeking to change by the creation of a simpler and more intelligible core limitations regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600046#UU00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491501900,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I will be brief because, unfortunately, I have approximately 700 pages of a report to read when I go back to the office.  It is kind of ironic that I will be going from one justice issue to another one.  <\/p>  <p>  We will be supporting this Bill for a number of reasons.  In fairness to Deputy Mick Wallace, he has been very honest in his opening contribution and said that there have been changes made in this area, which were not reflected in the Bill.  He has also been very honest in saying that the Bill is not perfect and he is very open to amendments.  It is for that reason we believe it should go to Committee Stage.  Under the new arrangements, a Private Members' Bill which passes Second Stage and goes to Committee Stage must go through a pre-legislative process.<\/p>  <p>  I want to take up the Minister of State's last point.  He spent the best part of his speech criticising what was wrong with the Bill.  We all recognise that this is an area which needs to be reformed.  The Law Reform Commission stated that in its own report in 2011.  The Minister of State said that, \"It is also the view of the Government, in opposing the Bill, that the various, fundamental, cross-cutting and sweeping measures being proposed would need to be considered coherently as part of an overall reform of our limitation of actions regime.\"  He then went on to acknowledge, as Deputy Wallace did, the Law Reform Commission report of 2011 and its own recommendations.  However, he did not say when this area will be looked at.  It could have been looked at on Committee Stage, or during the pre-legislative process, if this Bill had been supported on Second Stage.  That would have been a very reasonable thing to do.  This Bill may or may not be voted down - it will depend on the numbers.  The Government is certainly opposing it.  If it is voted down on Second Stage, then that is the end of it.  The committee will not get an opportunity at the pre-legislative stage to look at the very important points which Deputy Wallace has outlined.  He touched on Article 6 and some of the reports he has read internationally and how this can affect not only commercial businesses but also people's personal mental health.  It is absolutely scandalous that a vulture fund could have six years to take an action.  That is an awful thing for someone to have hanging over his or her head.  We need to look at this area and I would have preferred for the Bill to progress.  Hopefully, Fianna F&aacute;il will support it.  I am not aware yet what its position is.  If it does support it, then it will go to Committee Stage and we will have the opportunity to look at it in the pre-legislative process.  It is not good enough for the Minister of State to come in and list all the things wrong with the Bill and say he recognises change is needed and that the Law Reform Commission has made a number of recommendations but will not going to do anything about it or set out a timeframe of when the issue is going to be addressed.  For that reason, we will support the Bill going to Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600047#VV00200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1491501900,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I am conscious that every Thursday evening, hundreds of thousands of Irish people tune into Oireachtas TV to see who is responsible for Private Members' business on Thursday evening.

The issue of limitation periods merits consideration and probably merits legislative intervention at some stage.  It is important people understand what a limitation period is.  In a way, a limitation period is a restriction on the rights of an individual or a company.  It seeks to say that one may have a right in cause of action to sue another person, but must exercise that right within a certain period of time.  One of the things Deputy Wallace has drawn attention to is that there are many different time periods for limitation actions in our law at present.  For instance, if one of us goes out of here this evening and is knocked down by a car, one has to institute proceedings within a two-year period in order to sue the person responsible if he or she is negligent.  However, if there is a breach of contract, the person or company has to be sued within a six-year period.<\/p><p>If a family member has been involved in a fatal injury proceedings must be instituted within two years.  The trend in recent times in western democracies is to reduce limitation periods.  We have to be cautious of that.  For instance, in Ireland at present we have reduced the limitation period for defamation actions to one year.  That means that one must institute a defamation action within a year.  If that is not done, one has the opportunity to make an application to court in the second year but after that the cause of action is gone.  I have pointed out in the Committee on Justice and Equality on a previous occasion that sometimes defamatory comments about an individual can be posted on an Internet site.  The time period starts to run from the time it is initially posted.  An individual may not become aware of that for a year or two.  The website on which the defamatory comments are based may suddenly become much more popular, and then this material is left on it, with the individual having no cause of action to pursue the defamer because of the fact that their rights have been extinguished by the limitation period.  <\/p> <p> In respect of other causes of action, it should be noted that for an assault one has six years within which to sue.  However, in maritime actions it must be done in two years.  Children involved in personal injuries actions must take a case within two years of reaching the age of 18.  In fairness to Deputy Wallace, he has identified that our limitation law probably does need to be examined more closely and perhaps should be more harmonised.  I urge a point of caution, however, because individuals sometimes do not become aware when a contract to which they are a party has been breached.  Under the law at present one has six years within which to initiate a breach of contract claim.  However, we have seen in decisions of the Supreme Court that it can be the case that a person does not become aware of his or her cause of action for a time and that can result in an unfairness to an individual who wants to pursue an action.  That happens and can happen particularly in areas of professional negligence where there may be a contract between an individual and their professional adviser or a duty of care in tort.  However, if the cause of action and the breach of contract occurred six years previously, one cannot take an action after that.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Wallace's intentions in this Bill are good.  He seeks to protect the small man and woman when it comes to the actions of banks and vulture funds.  However, it should be pointed out that internationally, those who really push for restriction on limitation actions and who want them to be reduced to smaller periods generally are businesses that do not want to be sued by individuals and the manner in which they can restrict that is by stating there is a certain period in which to sue and that is it.  I note, however, that is not Deputy Wallace's intention.  He has stated in the Long Title that he wants to change the Statute of Limitations in order that the time limit for causes of actions in respect of banks and vulture funds is changed from six years to two years.  That may be his intention.  My concern is that is not the effect of the Bill.  Section 11 of the Statute of Limitations 1957, as amended in 1991 and other legislation, governs all causes of actions in contract and tort.  Although Deputy Wallace wishes to limit it to actions being brought by vulture funds and banks, it will not be limited to them because it will apply to every person.  It will apply to the small man as well as to the bank.  <\/p> <p> When it comes to the law, the large companies, banks and large corporations are fully aware of what are their legal rights.  It is the smaller person who sometimes is not fully aware of it.  It is not unusual that persons only become aware after a number of years that they have a cause of action or a legitimate claim.  Sometimes people do not become aware of that until they get professional advice.  One thing that banks and vulture funds are not short of is professional advice.  Were this legislation to be introduced and were the limitation period to be subsequently reduced from six to two years for contract claims, it would not cause any problems for vulture funds or banks.  They would simply institute their proceedings within two years.<\/p> <p> An argument is made that people are better off having the claims initiated promptly.  I disagree.  Sometimes individuals are better off not having claims forced against them promptly.  Their financial position can improve.  Their property values can rise, and because of that - and we have seen it happen - sometimes they can get through their financial difficulties.  <\/p> <p> There are a number of other issues in respect of the proposed legislation, one of which is in the area of tort.  The Bill proposes that the period for tort shall be reduced from six years to two years in section 11(2)(a) of the principal Act.  Again, we have to be cautious of this.  At present there are many financial institutions who are taking claims against individuals.  All of those claims, I suspect, are claims in contract rather than tort.  Tort is the great cause of action that gives the individual the right to state he or she is in a relationship and is owed a duty of care by an individual or company that has been breached.  As the individual or company has been negligent, one is entitled to institute a claim for damages against that person or company.  If we reduce the term from six years to two years, it will be of no disadvantage to banks or vulture funds.  It will, however, be a disadvantage to the small man or woman Deputy Wallace is seeking to protect because they will find themselves in situations where they cannot bring their claim after two years.  Any individual acquainted with claims made in tort or professional negligence is aware that on many occasions, it takes individuals a number of years to figure out that they have been the victim of negligence on the part of a professional adviser or of a person who owes them a duty of care.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Wallace has identified that the Law Reform Commission produced a report on limitation periods in 2011.  It sought to harmonise limitation periods.  It is an area that should be looked at.  However, we should be cautious about limiting periods by too much.  One should remember that limitation periods are restrictions on the rights of individuals.  This is directed at banks and vulture funds but it will have an effect beyond that.  I thank Deputy Wallace for introducing the Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600047#VV00900","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491502500,"counter":504,"content":"<p>We will all benefit from the opportunity to discuss these issues here tonight.  There is an acceptance on our part that the scope of the Bill is too broad and there is agreement with some of the points made by some of the other Deputies and an acknowledgement that there may be some mistakes in the drafting.  It brings me back to the points made by Deputy Darragh O'Brien that should this progress, it will entail pre-legislative scrutiny at the justice committee.  The points made by our colleagues demonstrate that we would be able to get it into much better shape and allow us to address the fundamental issues at the heart of this, which all of us agree need to be addressed, namely, the unbearable stress and nightmare situations faced by people who have debt hanging over them for a substantial period.  It can be for decades in some instances with six years waiting for proceedings to start, a year or two of court action and then a judgment mortgage, which can sometimes last for 12 years.  In the course of somebody's lifetime that is a huge chunk taken out of it.  What is at stake here is not the discharging or writing off of debts.  It is actually about allowing debts to be pursued promptly, efficiently and fairly.  Deputy Wallace has already made the point that under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been binding in Ireland since 2003, each citizen is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time.  From the comments we have heard there seems to be an acceptance that six years is not a reasonable time, particularly if there is scope for it to be dragged out many years longer than that.  I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, said that we have the commission.  The point is that we have had it for six years and it made a very strong recommendation that the Statute of Limitations for a civil contract should be reduced to two years.<\/p><p>It called our current law &quot;inefficient&quot; but this was six years ago and the problem is that the issue has not yet been addressed.  The six-year limit was first set out in the limitation Act 1623, meaning it was plucked out of the air by 17th century merchants, which is not really a reason to hang onto it now. <br\/><br\/>The law and politics of debt in this country lag behind what is happening in reality.  We still treat banks as if they are gentlemanly, honest brokers and upright 17th century merchants genuinely and earnestly entering into contracts with individuals with only the best of intentions to extend credit and everything else.  Life is not like that and debt is not like that for citizens in this State who are experiencing enormous stress.  It is not what banks do any more.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, suggests that everything is grand now, that the mortgage situation is sorted out and that we are on the road to recovery but that is not what is being experienced by many of our citizens.  We need to put supports in place which ensure people get solutions whereby they can remain in their homes when they have mortgage debt but it should be done efficiently and promptly, not dragged out over years so that the situation hangs over them as their children grow up, meaning they waste the best years of their lives.<br\/><br\/>A good <i>Rolling Stone<\/i>article in 2012 described the US investment bank, Goldman Sachs, as a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smelt like money.  It focused on Goldman Sachs but it could be a description of many, if not most, banks and investment funds.  Ireland is a particularly friendly place for banks and is one of the top five tax havens in the world for banks, which get a very good and handy deal here.  We need to take these issues into account precisely because of what Deputy Wallace said, namely, that we have a growing market of bottom feeders who are coming into Ireland with only one purpose - to gather up outstanding debt.  The vehicles buy up the old debts that banks and other concerns see little point in pursuing after two or three years.  These little vampire squid take over the debt, wield the axe of threatened litigation over a debtor for six years and then, in a pincer movement, work to extract the debt by leaning heavily on the debtor without incurring the costs of litigation themselves.<br\/><br\/>We have to ask if the influx of these bottom feeders into Ireland goes some way to explain why there has not been any move by the Government to address the current Statute of Limitations.  The Law Reform Commission recommended it over six years ago but the bottom feeders give the banks plenty of time to sell on their debts to the bottom feeders while the banks pose as great models of forbearance and ordinary householders are squeezed.  It is that issue that this Bill is trying to address.  We accept that it needs amendment to make it do that but the urgency is clear.  Bottom feeders such as Liffey Acquisitions, a Goldman Sachs-owned special purpose vehicle, SPV, bought more than &euro;200 million of Irish commercial property loans in 2014 from Anglo Irish Bank.  These SPVs are basically vehicles for avoiding tax and Liffey Acquisitions collected &euro;17.1 million in cash repayments on the loans in its first year.  It paid no corporation tax and not a cent in PAYE tax because these companies do not have any employees in Ireland or create any jobs.  It is an area that needs huge attention.  If we do not address it, we are saying that it is acceptable to leave the axe of unprosecuted debt dangling over ordinary people's heads for six years or more.<br\/><br\/>There is an irony in this because we are quite happy to let debtors disappear down the memory hole if they are big enough.  That, after all, is why NAMA exists.  The State picked up the tab for &euro;42 billion in developer debts when NAMA was established  That is enough to establish, and fund for 50 years, a single tier public health service, free for everybody to use.  The Government cannot bring itself to increase the paltry &euro;35 million subvention to Bus &Eacute;ireann but finds nothing wrong with handing over billions in public money to be wasted by NAMA.  The people whose debts were happily written off have moved on with their lives, many of them carrying on in the same way as before.  The Bill does not address all of those issues and it would take a lot more than one Private Members' Bill to halt that situation but we live in a world where debt is a currency and Governments operate the casino of global finance.  Any finger on the scales that can balance things even slightly in favour of the ordinary person has to be explored and developed.  That is what we are trying to do, albeit imperfectly, and we appeal to the Minister to reconsider getting it into prelegislative scrutiny on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600048#WW00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491503100,"counter":506,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Jonathan O'Brien, Jim O'Callaghan and Clare Daly for their contributions.  I also thank Deputy Wallace for his putting forward of today's Private Members' Bill, aimed at  changing several aspects of the limitation of actions  regime in this jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that the Government is opposing the Bill for the various reasons of policy stated, the Bill has, in its discussion, facilitated a greater consideration and reflection of the interaction between the Statute of Limitations and our policy responses to debt and insolvency.  There is a shared ambition with Deputy Wallace to mitigate and reduce the pressures under which many people and families find themselves in addressing home mortgage debt and in personal debt resolution.  There is  undoubtedly a shadow of threatened enforcement proceedings which needs to be lifted from many people's lives.  It should be of some reassurance, however, that Deputy Wallace's Bill has come up for discussion at a time when the extensive series of reforms and initiatives which have recently been put into operation by way of addressing personal debt issues have started to bear fruit.  These are areas in which current Government policy, as expressed through our recently modernised insolvency and bankruptcy legislation, the Abhaile mortgage arrears resolutions service, the code of conduct for mortgage arrears, the Consumer Protections (Regulation of Credit  Servicing Firms) Act 2015, enhancement of the mortgage-to-rent scheme and other related Government initiatives, are already operating.  In combination, we must press on with them by way of achieving the necessary critical mass for them to have the desired lasting impact.  The underlying intention of the Government in the position it has taken today is solely to safeguard that progress, including by avoiding any unintended consequences in relation to limitation periods, while giving balanced protections to debtors as has been set out in my opening statement.<\/p>  <p>  While it may be for another time, it has to be recognised that the overall operation of the law in relation to the Statute of Limitations is a matter for reform.  I accept the points made in this regard by Deputies Clare Daly and Jim O'Callaghan.  The Law  Reform Commission has recognised this.  I agree that we need to engage in a co-ordinated process of taking account of the findings and recommendations of the relevant Law Reform Commission report of 2011 if we are to subject our limitations framework to coherent modernisation and structural reform.  As it stands, for example, the Statute of Limitations contains seven different limitation periods, the justification for some of which goes back to 17th century legislation.  The Law Reform Commission recommendations would greatly simplify this around a smaller number of core limitation periods with an overall expiry date.  We have got a real sense from our exchanges this evening of the fact that limitation periods can, in their application to real cases, cut both ways - in this case between debtors and creditors - and therefore need to be balanced in their relationship with other aspects of Government policy.<\/p><p>We should, therefore, continue to be guided by the objectives of the Law Reform Commission as set out in its 2011 report, namely, that \"a balance is struck between the competing rights of the plaintiff and the defendant, as well as having regard to the public interest; in particular the right of the plaintiff of access to the courts and the right to litigate, the right of the defendant to a speedy trail and to fair procedures, as well as the public interest in the avoidance of delayed claims and the timely administration of justice.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600049#XX00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491503700,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, and Deputies Jonathan O'Brien, O'Callaghan and Clare Daly for their contributions.  The Law Reform Commission thought we should address this problem six years ago.  I would argue that we need it now more than ever.  Ireland is a different place now than it was then.  We borrowed over &euro;60 billion to bail out the banks.  We made the ordinary people foot the bill.  People thought the banks would be very helpful to those who were in trouble with them because of the banking crisis and the collapse in the value of assets.  However, many people are still in a very difficult place with them.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the banks' assets that they could not sell went into NAMA.  Some of them were sold by the banks at a fraction of what it cost to build them.  They have been bought mainly by US vulture funds.  These vulture funds have had a massive impact on Ireland, including companies such as Lone Star, Blackstone, Oaktree, Starwood, Carval, Deutsche Bank and Cerberus.  They were facilitated by the then Fine Gael-Labour Party Government along with the banks and NAMA in acquiring a huge amount of property at fire-sale prices.  They may have moved against some of the bigger developers at an early stage, but an awful lot of stuff has now ended up in the hands of vulture funds which have small and medium-sized businesses and families with mortgages at their mercy.  These people are merciless; they do not care about people.  They do not think in those terms.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank stated in December 2016, that vulture funds now own 45,678 residential mortgages and 38% of these mortgages are more than 720 days in arrears.  It is hard to imagine what will happen to these people.  The Central Bank does not maintain a record of the number of commercial loans sold on by the original underwriter to these vulture funds.  We have been contacted by many small business owners who are being put under serious pressure by vulture funds.  It is amazing that the Central Bank does not have data on it.  Many people in small businesses must be really worried about what is coming down the tracks for them.<\/p>  <p>  Research by the accountancy firm Baker Tilly Hughes Blake has shown a rise in Irish companies entering examinership in the first quarter of 2017.  It attributes this to vulture funds which have bought up the debt of small businesses and are now pressurising debtors with more challenging repayment deadlines and interest rates.  It points out that the majority of these vulture funds bought the debt during the recession, but did not begin to move on it until recently.  This is an example of why we should move the limit from six years to two years.<\/p>  <p>  Occasionally vulture funds or banks will move as quickly as possible because it suits them, but sometimes it suits them to wait.  They will wait four or five years until it suits them better.  It might suit the individual debtor they are going after.  Not only do they have six years to go for a judgment against the debtor, but when they get the judgment, they can actually wait 12 more years before calling in that judgment.  In other words if they get a judgment against people in the courts but realise they do not have a bob and there is no point in going after them for the moment, they can wait up to 12 years before going after them.  What sort of life will such people live for those 12 years?<\/p>  <p>  A vulture fund might get a judgment against a builder and decide to wait until the builder makes a few bob.  What are the chances of that builder, who has the potential to contribute to the economy, going back into business and being a successful businessman again while there is a sword hanging over his head for another 12 years?  The vulture fund will just pick its time to go after its carcass.  It does not stack up and we should address it.<\/p>  <p>  I admit there are huge problems with the Bill, but let us look at it and fix it.  I am prepared to listen to everyone's point of view on it.  I realise that we did not draft the Bill as well as we should have, but this topic needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan said that something could happen and we might not find out about it until it is too late.  It might take three years to find out that something happened.  The Bill states that the action, \"shall not be brought after the expiration of two years from the date on which the cause of action accrued or became known...\".  It has to become known to the creditor and the clock only starts then.  It does not start from when it happened, but from when it becomes known to the creditor.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of a case where AIB recently threatened a family of four with judgment unless they sell their primary private residence.  The father is a professional in his late 50s working not too far from here.  Such a judgment would mean the father would lose his job because of the effect it would have on his career position.  In this case AIB hopes to receive &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000 from the equity - which is minimal against a net debt of &euro;1.5 million already written off but much more than it would receive in an ISI scenario and causing personal havoc for the family.<\/p>  <p>  Very often negotiations go on between individuals, banks and vulture funds, which is not going down on paper.  They would not like to have a record that could allow someone to say, \"Look what they said to me.\"  I know of many cases where the banks are refusing to put these discussions and arguments on paper and are moving against people in a very aggressive fashion.  I am sure it affects Government figures if it does not have clear black-and-white evidence of what these people are doing.<\/p>  <p>  The current blight within the legislative system is totally inequitable from the perspective that no matter how big or how small the actual debt happens to be, the sentence is the same 12 years in purgatory - something that certainly has to be questioned in our modern age.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the public have gotten into trouble, and bankruptcy could spell the end of their career, so they are left facing the barrel of the gun from the bank on one side or public humiliation on the other.  Not everybody likes the idea of bankruptcy to escape the wrath of these vulture funds.  There is a stigma associated with bankruptcy in Ireland.  It would be treated differently in America, but we are where we are.  I did not go into it voluntarily; Cerberus put me into it for exposing the fact that it paid a bribe to get Project Eagle across the line in Northern Ireland.  That is my problem now.<\/p>  <p>  The banks are well aware that many of these people do not see bankruptcy as an option for themselves because the humiliation can be difficult for them.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The banks are well aware of the predicament for thousands of their distressed clients, in particular those who are close to retirement.  The banks are letting their debtors know that they, the banks, can take their retirement lump sum at any time within the six years or 12 years, if they wait, before they impose the judgment.  Imagine such a scenario.  It is scary.  People are trapped in employment and, worse still, cannot retire for fear the banks will take their retirement lump sum.  The two years instead of six would certainly put manners on the banks and the vulture funds.  I plead with the Government to consider this now.  It is a long time since 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600050#YY00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491504300,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491504300,"counter":511,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 12 April 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017040600051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491504300,"counter":512,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 7.05 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 April 2017.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
