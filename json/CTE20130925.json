We made a submission to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform a couple of weeks ago and the message that we conveyed then will be similar to the one that we convey today, based on the views of our 10,000 members and on the services they provide across the State.  We spent &euro;40 million in direct assistance to households in 2011, of which &euro;10 million was for energy costs, between &euro;3 million and &euro;4 million on education costs and most of the remainder was spent on overall household costs, including food costs.  That paints a picture of poverty not only among people who have come to us over a long period, but people who have come to us for the first time in recent years.  There is an entrenched level of hopelessness and suffering, which is borne out by the volunteers who work for us.  We assisted people through the boom and we continue to assist people, but the intensity in which we do so has been exacerbated during the past five to six years in this climate of austerity.<\/p><p>  As Members well know, the timescale of this year's budget is different but so, too, is our approach.

Clearly, Government needs to balance its books over the medium term, but given the level of need and the suffering that our volunteers and services see day in, day out, we have no option but to say \"no\" to further austerity and to ask that the 2014 budget marks an end to the austerity budgets.<\/p> <p>We are buoyed up this morning by what the former IMF staffer Ashoka Mody stated and by Deputy Stephen Donnelly's underlining of some of the points we are trying to make to those in power and in decision-making positions on the need to protect the individuals and families we assist.  Committee members may know that the vast majority of those we assist are families, and the largest single group consists of lone parents.  We are at pains to assist families and individuals with the costs of energy and education, general household costs and debt, which is a growing issue.<\/p><p> Today we have been asked to discuss social protection and education.  We have a number of overall social protection policy objectives for this year.  We want a living income, in and out of work, and this is with regard to protecting an adult social welfare rate, protecting eligibility for these working age payments, and protecting the family income supplement, which we see as a key support for families in work but on low pay.<\/p><p> With regard to our other objectives, we seek the elimination of child poverty and the development of child well-being.  In this regard, child income support is relevant, as are supports at school and preschool level, which is why we advocate the protection and augmentation of the early childhood care and education scheme with regard to the number of weeks and its quality and, over the longer term, extension to a second year.<\/p><p> School meals are a key component of tackling disadvantage and deprivation as they help children focus on their work and help their overall development.  We seek stronger co-ordination between the Departments and a more cohesive approach to get better outcomes in this regard.  After-school care is important, and we hope to see it develop in the coming years.<\/p><p> Our key concerns are a living income for those in and out of work and tackling child poverty through income supports and education intervention.

USI's pre-budget submission, which is a more concise document than we submitted in previous years, has been circulated.  I will focus in particular on one issue which we highlight in the submission.<\/p><p>  What the crisis and debacle about the processing last year of grants by Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, achieved was to highlight the importance of the maintenance grant to vulnerable students and families throughout the country.  In the past four consecutive budgets the student maintenance grant was cut, in either range or threshold, by between 3% and 5%.  In recent weeks an Irish League of Credit Union study showed the cost of college has increased to more than &euro;1,000 per month on average for families, and 84% of such families struggle to meet the costs of third level as it currently stands.  The gap between the pared-back supports and the cost of college means many families are at breaking point.  In our pre-budget submission we include a quote from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the level of student grants in 2011, particularly at the standard rate, as being insufficient to meet the costs of college.  Three budgets and three cuts later, this is even more the case.  Our message is that any further cutbacks to the student maintenance grant will not only mean that students will struggle but will be very much an anti-family measure.<\/p><p>  The maintenance grant at its average rate is &euro;84 per week.  This is totally unacceptable if we consider the lowest acceptable rate of jobseeker's allowance for a young person to be &euro;100 per week.  Given the saturated market, many students are unable to find part-time employment to support them in college.<\/p> <p>Their families have little disposable income to support them, given the wider impacts of the recession.  The demand on the student assistance and hardship funds has reached breaking point in many colleges.<\/p><p> I returned from Galway this morning, where I attended a class rep training event in my old college, the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT.  I spoke about someone I knew while working there last year and who is no longer in college there.  That student went through three years of a level 7 course on the highest rate of the maintenance grant, which I also received while in college in light of my socioeconomic background, and absorbed three consecutive years of cuts to the rate.  Before attempting to move on to level 8 this year in the fourth year of his degree, however, he was moved from the highest threshold rate to the second highest as a result of last year's measure.  Consequently, he has dropped out and moved to London in search of work that is not in his chosen field.<\/p><p> I have seen the impact of cuts on the ground, not only to students' finances but to their mental health and so on.  While being pragmatic enough to understand the state of the country's finances, I call on the committee to make the student maintenance grant a priority in the upcoming budget.<\/p><p> No Union of Students in Ireland, USI, representative would appear before this committee without alluding to student charges and fees.  I would be lax not to mention how the increase in the student contribution has had an adverse effect on family budgets.  According to the ILCU study to which I referred, 71% of families have seen their budgets severely affected by increases.  According to more recent figures, these budgets are already struggling.  People are falling behind on bills and other payments.  While we accept the multi-annual budgeting nature of the charges, including the increases in the student contribution charge, we call on the Government to consider committing to rowing back on this charge in line with future economic recovery.  In the same way that the Haddington Road agreement deals with pay cuts for public servants, struggling and vulnerable students and families should be afforded the same treatment.<\/p><p> I will touch on a last issue before handing over to my colleague, Ms Harmon.  We alluded to postgraduate loans in our pre-budget submission.  When many students finished college a number of years ago, they had three choices - emigrate, go on the dole or proceed to postgraduate degrees - given the significant jobs crisis facing young people who left college.  With the decision to remove almost all fee, maintenance and postgraduate grants, many of these students now face only two choices, emigration or the dole.  At 10.8%, the interest rate of the Bank of Ireland postgraduate loan scheme, which was endorsed by the Minister after this decision, is exorbitant.  Any student who previously qualified for a maintenance grant at postgraduate level is afforded the opportunity to take on &euro;2,000 in additional debt.  The most vulnerable families and students are becoming trapped in a spiral of additional debt.  It is accepted across the board - by the Department of Education and Skills, Opposition spokespersons and everyone with whom I have discussed the matter - that this is an unsustainable situation in the long term and creates social inequity and a barrier to accessing postgraduate education for people who could be the highly skilled drivers of our future recovery.  Therefore, I call on the Government and this committee to push for this topic to be re-examined with a view to creating a more sustainable and affordable environment for students who wish to progress to postgraduate education.<\/p><p> I will not address the European youth employment guarantee aspect of our pre-budget submission at length, as we will have the opportunity to address it with the committee after the budget.  If the proposals required to make the guarantee work are to be rolled out effectively, funding must be made available.  In members' representations in advance of the budget, they should call for the provision of adequate funding to resource the youth guarantee and match EU funding.<\/p><p> Ms Harmon will briefly discuss the back-to-education allowance and mature students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500005#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380111300,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank members for giving us the opportunity to address them.  It is good to be here.  I will discuss another key issue in our pre-budget submission, namely, mature students' access to education.  While access rates are at just over 15%, they fall short of the Higher Education Authority's 2013 target of 20%.  The back-to-education allowance is an important scheme for students wishing to upskill or reskill.  It is also an important scheme in terms of social inclusion for those who are economically disadvantaged.<\/p> <p>Many of the changes introduced via budgets in the past number of years have affected mature students, including the reduction of the back-to-education allowance from &euro;500 to &euro;300 in one budget, followed by abolition of that allowance in the last budget; changes in the rates for people under 25 years of age and the equalisation of rates for those over 25 years of age - it is estimated that savings this year in respect of the back-to-education scheme will be in the region of 5.1%; the fact that people in receipt of the back-to-education allowance no longer qualify for the grant; and changes to the distance rates, which means people must now reside 45 kilometres rather than 24 kilometres from their place of study in order to qualify for a grant, which in the main affects mature students, many of whom are commuters.  <\/p><p> A national survey undertaken by Mature Students Ireland prior to budget 2012, to which more than 2,000 people responded, found that 43% of mature students were in precarious economic circumstances and 94% were okay or just getting by.  This issue is affecting not only individuals but also families.  Some 44% of respondents to the survey had at least one dependent child, 25% had two or more dependent children and 46% had at least one dependent adult.  There is a need, when considering cuts to schemes such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, to look at the broader picture.  These are issues that are severely affecting families and students.<\/p><p> The USI advocates that there should be no more changes to the rate of the back-to-education allowance.  However, we do acknowledge that improvements can be made to the scheme.  For example, while in 2005, 63% of people in the back-to-education scheme went on to part- or full-time employment and 9% went on to further education, some 60% are now returning to the live register.  This is not necessarily indicative of the scheme not working; rather, it is more the economic situation in which we as a country find ourselves.  <\/p><p> We believe there is a need for a more consultative approach.  Because the back-to-education scheme is a self-selecting scheme, participants could be directed to courses that might be better suited to them.  Also, in terms of the requirement for a person to be progressing to a higher level of education, it should be possible for a case manager to waive that requirement if he or she believes the person would benefit from a course which would help return him or her to employment more quickly.  We also propose the introduction of a national skills map, which Mr. O'Connor will speak about later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500006#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Laura Harmon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380111600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I understand the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has also prepared a submission on equality budgeting, which is another theme being explored by the committee.

While we are not experts in this field, from our own intuition and that of our members, of whom there are 10,500, who link the impact of the lack of an equality-budgeting approach to how they experience access to social welfare benefits, we welcome the opportunity to discuss this briefly with the committee.<\/p><p>  We understand what is meant by an approach to economic decision-making and planning that puts equality at the heart of decision-making concerning public expenditure and income.  We believe that equality audits and impact assessments are the tools for doing so, and we take no issue with that.  We support evidenced-based decision making because we believe this must be the way forward if we are to get the best from scarce resources.  We understand this to mean evaluating the impact that expenditure and resources have on specific groups and, importantly, finding out who benefits from economic policy measures and who does not.<\/p> <p>It improves transparency, which is also very positive.<\/p><p> Through our work and the people sitting in kitchens, we are aware of the unintended outcomes that can occur when policy decision making is done without robust tools.  For example, the absence of poverty-proofing has had very negative impacts on households that we have worked with, particularly in the domestic waste area.  It was almost ten years ago that it was introduced by the Department and it affected poor households disproportionately, causing a degree of social unrest.  It did not do any of us proud and the problem was compounded by very inconsistent approaches by the various service providers and income gatherers.<\/p><p> This issue was raised by our volunteer group, the vast majority of which are engaged in household visitation.  We got a critical on-the-ground perspective of how poorly planned policies and cuts to income supports can have a very negative impact.  With education, it is of no surprise to members, who will have heard it from a variety of sources, that the cumulative nature of the erosion or explicit rationing of supports to those who have the least ability to buy private commoditised goods - whether it is grinds or educational psychological assessments, as noted by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in - is an issue.  If people can afford a few hundred euro for them, they will get through the system more quickly and have access to more resources.  There is a range of issues predicated on an ability to pay.  Uniforms, books, voluntary contributions, trips and equipment are issues for our members, and there is an inability to pay for persistent demands which has eroded the poorest families' ability to achieve a minimum essential standard of living.<\/p><p> We do not have much time but we are aware from a variety of sources that the most recent budgets have had a negative impact on those with the least on which to live.  I know there are many statistics in the presentation, and we want to engage with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500007#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Audry Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380111900,"counter":22,"content":"<p>It might be useful to take questions on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500008#N00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380111900,"counter":23,"content":"<p>There was a drop of 4% in the working aid social welfare payments in each of 2010 and 2011, and after that we have not had any further cuts to core rates.  There has been a relatively large and persistent erosion of or change in eligibility entitlements to various social welfare payments.  As an example, the Union of Students in Ireland has referenced the change in the jobseeker's benefit and allowance and specifically the number of contributions needed to get access to the various schemes.  There has also been a change to the rent supplement scheme.  We know the social impact assessment of the main welfare and direct taxation measures in the last budget, and that households with children - particularly with lone parents, to which we will refer - have been worst affected by these measures.  Despite the purely economic stance and the idea that the budget has technically not been regressive, we know from various sources that the impact of the ancillary changes to eligibility and entitlement have created significant problems for those dependent on payments.<\/p><p>  Lone parents are an important cohort for us, not least because they form the biggest cohort with which we work.  Members are aware that this group experiences the most consistent poverty, at 16.4%, and it also experiences relative poverty.  Some 56% of the group experience deprivation, which is a shocking statistic for households with children.  The explicit changes to eligibility, earnings disregards and, most recently, the jobseeker's transitional payment are having a cumulative and shocking effect on income in these households.  We do not have time to go through it, but the recent parliamentary questions have been most helpful in revealing the amounts of money being lost because of earnings disregard changes.<\/p> <p>There is no question there.  In fact, since budget 2009 the lone-parent household has suffered an income loss of &euro;847.60, and that does not even factor in the child benefit universal payment.<\/p><p> This committee has heard often about what the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has offered us.  We believe it has a very large role to contribute to the area of and approach to equality budgeting.  Its rigorous and robust data, based on a very robust methodology, clearly show that the Irish taxation and social welfare systems do not work coherently to support those on the lowest incomes.  Social welfare transfers alone provided an income which allowed for a minimum essential standard of living in only 11 out of the 208 households that it forensically examined.  That is a quite shocking statistic.  This is obviously due to critical failures at policy level and in integrated policy decision making.  It is ripe ground to look at for equality budgeting.<\/p><p> To conclude, equality budgeting can be used to reduce inequalities and improve outcomes for disadvantaged groups and, indeed, help to deal with the gender issue regarding lone parents, which does not have to be spelt out to the audience today.  If this is done coherently and with a long-term view, it would be a most useful tool for all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500008#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Audry Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380112200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

I have a few questions for Mr. McCafferty regarding social welfare.  It is chilling to reflect on the fact that the expenditure the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has had to incur to make up for the shortfall in State support increased by over 56% between 2008 and 2011.  That is a shocking figure, particularly at a time when the society is finding it more difficult to get donations because of the recession.  Mr. McCafferty will be aware that the budget for community welfare payments for once-off items of expenditure for poor families has been slashed.  It has been reduced over the past two years by 40% in actual terms, which is worse than real terms.  There were reports in the media during the year that community welfare officers who accepted the validity of certain cases raised with them were referring people to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, among other charitable organisations.  Is that true?<\/p><p>  Second, with regard to the changes in entitlement to fuel allowance, he will also be aware that there is a specific commitment in the programme for Government to combat fuel poverty.  However, what has happened in respect of fuel poverty in the past two years is that there has been a massive increase in energy prices, a carbon tax has been imposed, there has been a reduction in the period for which fuel allowance is paid from 32 weeks to 26 weeks and, in the last budget, the free electricity allowance, which played a big part in combating fuel poverty, has been reduced by over 60% in terms of how much it can benefit a client.  Has Mr. McCafferty noticed the impact of this in his dealings with people?  Has it generated more demand for the society's support?<\/p><p>  I note the comment that there has been an intensification of poverty.  The internationally accepted poverty line for a single adult living alone is &euro;204 per week.  The rate of jobseeker's allowance is &euro;188 per week, so those recipients are living under the poverty line.  They are officially at risk of poverty.  They are trying to exist from week to week.  The poverty rate for children living in families below the poverty line is one in five.<\/p> <p>That is about double the OECD average.  The percentage of children living in consistent poverty has increased, dramatically, to 9.5%.<\/p><p> I thank the delegates for exploding the myth that everything will be okay if we do not change core rates.  People have been devastated by changes to the eligibility criteria and I know individuals who have been taken out of the social welfare system because of changes to eligibility rates.  It is not of much use to them to hear that core rates have not changed because they are no longer eligible for any rate.  These points have been gone through in detail.  We are told that we should not reduce the core rate of jobseeker's benefit but the period for which it is paid.  We are told we should not reduce the core rate of carer's allowance but to reduce the respite care grant.  The grant is available to everyone in receipt of carer's allowance and there is effectively a reduction of &euro;7 per week in what a person receives.  We are told we are not reducing the core rates, but we have now got rid of the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance for children up to the age of four years.  The rates for other ages have been slashed and eligibility has been tightened.<\/p><p> It is stated on page 4 of the delegates' submission relating to lone parents that \"Reductions in the earnings disregard and changes in eligibility for the one parent family payment mean that lone parents in employment [the only way most of them are surviving is through part-time employment] have seen and will continue to see significant falls in their incomes\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500009#O00300","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380112500,"counter":28,"content":"<p>As the Deputy has been speaking for five minutes, perhaps he might finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500010#P00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1380112500,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I have been trying to make the point to the Minister at Question Time and in various debates that the changes are a disincentive to lone parents to go out to work.

It goes a long way to explaining why we are looking at these things in isolation and not looking at the cumulative impact for poorer families.  It is little wonder that the past three budgets have been regressive.

Do the delegates from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul expect them to carry over?  Does the society receive the same number of requests for help from the student population?  Will the USI comment on its experience last year compared to this year in how SUSI is working out?<\/p> <p>I refer to the USI and the youth guarantee.

Our members work very closely with community welfare officers at a local level because much of the time, they are helping the same people.  It is important to acknowledge the pressure on the community welfare service because of the extra demands and so on.  Having said that, there seems to be a tightening up of the flexibility community welfare officers used to have where they could look at a person's particular circumstances and help him or her out even though he or she perhaps did not fall into any particular bracket.  In some cases, community welfare officers refer people to us and, similarly, we refer people to them.  It is not entirely negative because we want to ensure we are helping people to the best extent we can.  However, it is important for community welfare officers to be able to be flexible with people and to meet their needs as they present.  The SVP should be the absolute last resort after the State has come in and done what it can to help people.  We should be there as the last resort rather than the first person to call.<\/p><p>  In terms of the changes for one-parent families, when the one-parent family payment was brought in, it had features to encourage and support people in taking up employment - that is, people with caring responsibilities who might not be able to take up a well-paid full-time job but who still wanted to be in the labour force, because the poverty in one-parent families is concentrated among those who are entirely reliant on social welfare.  One-parent families which can work are doing somewhat better.  However, the changes, particularly to the earnings disregard, mean that people are not able to earn as much as they were and to keep some of their one-parent family payment.  The amount of money people will lose as a result of that is colossal, in particular for  those who are earning lower amounts of money.  If one is earning &euro;200, one loses quite a lot.  However, one is still losing perhaps &euro;50 per week even if one is earning &euro;400.  When we got those responses to the parliamentary questions, we really felt the features of the one-parent family payment which supported employment were being taken away and, of course, that is a disincentive to employment.  It means some people will not be able to keep their jobs.  That is the bottom line.  With one in five children living in a jobless household, it will contribute more to that problem.  We are asking Government to stop taking away the earnings disregard.  The plan is to bring it down to &euro;60, which is the same as that which applies to jobseekers, but that does not reflect the fact that people who are parenting alone have a particular set of needs that people who do not have a child relying on them would have.<\/p><p>  I refer to family income supplement.  These things all connect up, so because of the changes to the one-parent family payment, FIS is even more important.  In the report of the advisory group on tax and welfare, we were very concerned to see that the proposal was to replace FIS with another payment which would be paid at a lower rate.  If people can get family income supplement, it is a huge benefit to them as it provides considerable support.  This lower payment would not do the same.  FIS is not perfect.  Many people who are eligible for it do not seem to be taking it up but we do not feel the solution is to abolish it, especially when we are saying to one-parent families that we will take away their one-parent family payment.  Family income supplement can make up for much of that difference, and if it was gone there would be an even worse problem.  <\/p><p>  There was a massive advertising campaign around the digital switchover.  We have huge campaigns around the television licence.  Perhaps something could be looked at in regard to the family income supplement.  There are other ways in which it could be given to people.  We would like to see some proposals on a refundable tax credit to support families in low-paid work.  We are not saying FIS is perfect, but do not abolish it until something better is in place to support those families.  <\/p><p>  With regard to child poverty, child benefit has been reduced considerably in the past number of years.<\/p> <p>We know from the advisory group's report that 80% of children are in families that earn less than &euro;80,000.  When we talk about child benefit, the focus is always on high income families who get the payment.  We need to focus, however, on what the changes are doing to low and middle income families who get the payment, that is, the majority of families.  We are advocating for no further cuts to child benefit because it is an anti-poverty measure and the payment has been cut so much already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500011#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Fahey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380113400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I will deal very briefly with the SUSI issue as I am sure our colleagues from USI will have more to say on it.  It is way too early to know, for the current academic year, how many people will come to us, but every year, particularly in the Dublin region, hundreds of thousands of euro are given out by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to subsidise a dysfunctional grant provider system.  It is very difficult for us, regardless of whether the grant applications are successful, to claw that money back.  Everyone here is well aware of how transformative it is, particularly for families whose first child is going on to third level education, in terms of being a route out of poverty.<\/p><p>  We cannot understand how SUSI was set up so poorly and the review makes for very sobering reading.  I hope SUSI will get the resources it so obviously needs to be able to do its job effectively.  Unfortunately, in terms of SUSI's first year of functioning, the hard cases are still coming home to roost.  As late as last Friday, I heard from a student who had gone back to Maynooth to do a higher diploma to get a job.  There was ping ponging back and forward with SUSI.  It had the forms, it lost the forms and so forth.  A form was missing and neither side could prove that it had been sent or received.  The end result was that she was being billed for &euro;6,500 by Maynooth, correctly from its perspective.  She was not able to get SUSI to approve her grant and, as a result, was unable to access her higher diploma.  She cannot use the qualification that she had received to gain employment.  That is just one example of how difficult it can be for students who end up on the wrong side of SUSI.  The human cost is quite sobering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500012#R00150","nonspeaker":"Ms Audry Deane"},{"type":"speech","time":1380113400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>Can I clarify a point?

On the SUSI question, it is important to note that our experience at this point is that a number of the changes and reforms which USI recommended last year have been implemented and we are reasonably satisfied that the system is quite a bit ahead in terms of numbers of applications that have been processed in comparison with the same time last year.  The next couple of months, as we go into payment stage for a lot of students, will be crucial.  It is vital that all Deputies continue to monitor the situation to ensure the timelines that have been set out are met and that we can head off any potential crisis.  In the second year of operation, things seem to be much improved but the system is still far from perfect, although, as the Deputy said earlier, the previous grant system was also far from perfect.<\/p><p>  The point made by the Deputy about students in receipt of grants still accessing the services of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is most relevant.  We cannot allow the fact that students may get their grants in a more timely fashion this year to mask the real issue.  That real issue is the fact that in recent years and long before SUSI was set up, there has been an enormous strain on the student assistance fund and on student hardship funds in individual colleges.  An extra &euro;3 million was allocated to that fund last year as a direct result of the SUSI debacle.  However, that money was absolutely necessary, regardless of any delays, in terms of meeting the shortfall that exists between the cost of college and the student supports available.<\/p> <p>For such a small amount of money, this is a direct way to funnel money to the most vulnerable students in the system.  Regardless of SUSI, this needs to be prioritised again this year.<\/p><p> I would make one more point on this.  Even if the grant is being paid a little bit earlier or on time, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, report from 2011 states that given the relatively low income thresholds at which students may qualify for support - these have been reduced by 3% since the report - any reduction in the rate would impact most severely on students from the least well-off backgrounds and possibly even contribute to an increase in rates of dropout which would negate the overall investment made by the State in such students at third level.  From Government officials, that, in itself, highlights the stark importance of protecting the maintenance grant.<\/p><p> On the youth guarantee, the organisations - USI, ICTU and the Irish secondary schools' students' union - have come together as three groups representing over 1 million members looking at what is a huge national crisis in terms of youth unemployment and emigration, and taking a proactive and serious step in our own way to reach out and provide a positive response to this crisis.  The first point is that we would like a national coherent joined-up national jobs strategy for young people across the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Social Protection - which is where the youth guarantee sits - and Education and Skills.  It is vitally important that there is a joined-up approach taken to this in all of the measures which fall between three Departments included in our document, which I would be happy to circulate to members of the committee before we present it in the coming months.<\/p><p> The other measures we recommend include that the European youth guarantee, which will allow any young person within four months of becoming unemployed a training place, education place or some sort of an apprenticeship, cannot be merely an extension of existing schemes.  There needs to be a real and substantive commitment to funding this scheme, and the three partners that have been involved in this process are heavily engaged as key stakeholders in the design, implementation, review and monitoring of the European youth guarantee.  Certainly, some of the issues which have arisen out of JobBridge could have been addressed by a closer monitoring of the way the scheme is rolled out because there are some positive elements to that scheme.<\/p><p> We also are recommending a best-practice document which we have for work placements, internships and apprenticeships.  Ms Harmon spoke earlier about the back-to-education allowance.  We are proposing a national skills map across the country whereby skills gaps and deficits across regions and across sectors where there is need within the labour market would be identified using a national skills map.  There is the potential in reforming labour activation schemes, such as the back-to-education allowance, to direct them towards programmes that meet those skills needs.  We are not saying that one should not look at the back-to-education allowance scheme to try to improve the scheme; it can be improved.  However, the issue is in students, who receive the back-to-education allowance and go to college, proceeding to get employment out of that.  The issue is not the rate of the scheme because as a measure of getting the unemployed off the live register and getting them into third level it is very effective.  There is a number of other proposals within that.<\/p><p> If I may make one last point before I conclude because I do not think there were any other questions, as the joint committee responsible for education, I want to make a pledge to it as a whole.  It is very much our view in USI that education is not public spending but public investment.  Too often, we get boxed off into this argument about whether we are better off having overcrowded classrooms at primary level or having young people dropping out of education at third level.  It is not an either-or matter.  There has been so much talk about the scale of the budgetary adjustment over the past number of weeks and months and I would ask everyone here to put forward the argument that education as a return on investment, both socially and economically, is the direction that this country needs to take, and any decisions that are taken need to stand up to that principle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500012#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380114000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Can Mr. O'Connor put a figure on how much the Government will have to commit by way of matching funding for the European youth guarantee scheme?

The life impact of poverty on young people is very obvious.<\/p><p>  I have given a lot of thought to the budget because we all have a responsibility in the run-up to what are to be difficult times.  I have a point that I will make not by way of a question because I am not sure whether the contributors would want to comment on it.  I am no longer in favour of universal child benefit.  I grew up in what would have been considered to be a working-class area, Ballyfermot, in the 1960s.  I am very proud of it.  A very small percentage, 3%, of those who finished second level schooling got the opportunity to proceed to further studies or third level.  I have no doubt that not only access but also poverty played a major part in that outcome.  The latest Growing Up in Ireland study gives us a very clear insight into how poverty affects education.  We know that by the age of three, for example, children from more deprived or poorer areas are more likely to display behavioural problems, suffer from obesity or have a poor diet.  Even before they start their educational life, they are lagging behind.<\/p><p>  Why should Mr. Michael O'Leary or I - if I were a Member with young children - be entitled to the same entitlements as other families?  When are we seriously going to make hard decisions about channelling the limited resources available to the Minister to those who have not has opposed to those who have?  There are so many impacts on affected young people that must be considered.<\/p><p>  Despite the Minister's efforts at social protection, many people and I are aware of the continuing abuse of the child benefit payment.  I refer to people coming from outside Ireland &ndash; we all know this happens &ndash; to claim payment.  We hear this from reliable sources.  We must ensure that those who are most needy can avail of the limited resources we have available.  This is a big challenge for the Minister and I know she is committed to it.

Yesterday in the D&aacute;il, I referred to the social housing Bill which will be coming before us in this session or early in the next.  I see that Ms Deane has put down a supplementary note on the impact of the rent supplement scheme.  One of the biggest issues I come across in my constituency office is social housing, and I am sure it is the same for other Deputies as well.  At the height of the boom, very little was done about social housing.  During 14 years, the previous Government did very little about it.  We had the property boom when developers were supposed to build private houses for profit, giving 10% to social housing.  However, the Government of the day allowed those developers a get-out clause of which most of them availed, so we ended up with no new social housing.<\/p><p>  Rent supplements and social housing are the biggest issues with which community welfare officers have to deal.  In my county we have no social housing.  We are waiting for some houses to be done up and it is a serious problem.  I would like Ms Deane to give some feedback on this issue.  We have been told that the only show in town at the moment is the rent allowance, which is putting people on the bottom rung of the social protection ladder under severe pressure.  It is difficult even to get a place because in certain cases a lot of landlords might not be registered or do not want rent allowance tenants.<\/p><p>  We can see what &euro;30 million has done for the schools budget with extensions being built to replace prefabs.  A lot of work has been undertaken for that sum, so we should put a similar plan in place to start building social housing.  The lack of such accommodation is a major problem for vulnerable people.<\/p><p>  I agree with Ms Fahey that the family income supplement should not be done away with.  We need to revamp it in some shape or form.  People in the food sector, including restaurants, can find people to work 19 or 20 hours per week, but they cannot get anyone to do a full week's work.  We must examine the way the family income supplement is distributed.  Rather than being abolished, it should be re-examined and revitalised.<\/p><p>  Social housing is like a can that has been kicked down the road for years, while nothing has been done about it.

It is an opportune time because the budget will take place in a few weeks' time.  I thank the witnesses for giving us their views on what needs to be done to assist the sectors of society they serve so well and for which they are so important.  As they have said, there needs to be a focus on ensuring that the quality of life of students and the poorest people in our society is protected, maintained and improved as much as possible.  I would like both organisations to develop a couple of points that were made.  One of the representatives of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul said there should be a particular focus on preschool education.  I appreciate that the preschool sector has developed significantly over the last five or six years.  This new initiative has greatly enhanced the educational prospects of young people and has helped to address child poverty.  I would like the witnesses from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to expand on what it hopes might be achieved in the forthcoming budget.  Reference has been made to school meals in this context.  After-school care needs to be developed much further as the services that are available in this area are very limited in many areas.<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Connor from the Union of Students in Ireland highlighted the important role played by the student assistance fund last year, particularly for the many students who were severely affected by the incompetence associated with the initial establishment of SUSI, which seems to be operating much more effectively this year.  Responsibility for administering the student assistance fund, which plays a massive role, is devolved to individual institutions, which are able to use their common sense and judgment to disburse funds to those students who need it most.  Mr. O'Connor mentioned that an additional allocation was made last year.  On the basis of its engagement with various colleges, and in light of the pressure that came on the fund last year, what level of funding does the USI consider necessary to meet the likely demand for the fund this year?<\/p><p>  What is the current position with regard to students who are awaiting responses from SUSI and other bodies about their grants?  Has the USI encountered any problems this year in respect of the payment of registration fees?  Are demands being placed on students to pay registration fees before it has been confirmed whether they qualify for a grant?  It was important that a degree of leeway was afforded last year.  I have a sense that there may be problems in a couple of instances this year.  I wonder if that is something the USI has encountered.  If so, it should be addressed.  No student who is awaiting a decision on the award of a grant should be asked to pay the registration fee up-front.  If the fee is out of that student's range, his or her continuation in college will be placed at risk.<\/p><p>  There has been massive regression in the area of postgraduate study in the last couple of years.<\/p> <p>As the Union of Students in Ireland has pointed out, the maintenance grant and the fees for students undertaking postgraduate studies have been done away with in recent budgets.  They have been replaced with a &euro;2,000 fee award for students under a certain family income threshold.  What has the USI experience been in respect of the take-up of postgraduate studies?  What has been the experience of students unions throughout the country?  I believe there is a real situation at the moment because postgraduate studies are quickly becoming the preserve of those who can afford to go to college and who have their own means.  They are not easily accessible at the moment.  What are the thoughts of the USI on the developing situation at postgraduate level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500016#V04100","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380115800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>We are here ahead of the budget which is due in three weeks time.  Whatever comes to pass, whether it is a softer budget of &euro;2.5 billion in cuts, a hard budget of &euro;3.1 billion in cuts or somewhere in between, the reality is that there will be adjustments, in particular in the two areas we are discussing today.  Certainly, there will be adjustments in social protection.  At the moment there is talk about the Minister, Deputy Burton, having to adjust by &euro;440 million.  Whether that ends up being the case or whether it is somewhat lower I am unsure, but if it is lower, there will be hardship and adjustments.<\/p><p>  I thank both groups for their presentations, which are important contributions to the debate about the budget.  I hope that whatever the Minister, Deputy Burton, has to do, she will not hit the priority areas identified by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, namely, child benefit and family income supplement.  In speaking to our Ministers ahead of the budget, Labour Party members will be strongly arguing the case the society is making and we have been doing so for the past two or three budgets.  Regardless of whether people in the room like it, the heavy work done in terms of adjustments that we inherited has had to be done and this budget was going to be a tough one irrespective.  Whether it is &euro;3.1 billion or &euro;2.5 billion in cuts, it will be tough for many people.  We will be fighting hard to ensure the priorities of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are maintained because they are our priorities as well and we share them.<\/p><p>  There is talk of the Minister, Deputy Quinn, having to reduce his budget by &euro;100 million on the education side.  The reality is that education, social protection and health are the big spending Departments and to achieve the &euro;3.1 billion or &euro;2.5 billion or whatever in cuts, it cannot be done without adjustments in these areas.  We must be honest with people that this work has to be done.  We wish it did not have to be done but the reality is there will be a good deal of pain for many people.  However, I hope that following this budget, things will get a little easier.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  They can rest assured that people in the Labour Party Parliamentary Party will be fighting hard to make it as easy as possible and, one hopes, to protect the priorities of the witnesses as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500017#W00200","speaker":"1013"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380115800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The figures for the overall budgetary adjustment started out at approximately &euro;44 million but shot upwards from several different elements.  One of these relates to redress payments for the victims of clerical abuse.  While this issue must be addressed, we are concerned that the children of the future will be made to pay for the sins of the past if some of these cuts come about as a result of that saving.  Although obviously there will be pain in this budget, the difference between &euro;2.5 billion and &euro;3.1 billion is significant in the context of a maximum of &euro;100 million savings in education.  This is why I am advocating that education is an investment to the State that must be prioritised in this budget.<\/p><p>  I have no wish to get into the political argument around this but the reality is that people in the USI this year are not concerned with what has happened in previous years or budgets.  There is no doubt that under the last couple of Governments, measures have been carried out which have greatly affected our members.  Although longer-term debates on third level funding and so on must be worked through, we are convinced that protecting the maintenance grant is the only way to protect the most vulnerable people we represent and that is why we are keen to get that message across strongly.<\/p> <p> In reply to Deputy Charlie McConalogue's questions about the student assistance fund, I have been involved in the GMIT students' union for the past three years, a college in which more than half of the students are on maintenance grants and from lower socio-economic backgrounds.  The demand in both colleges in Galway - NUIG and GMIT - has more than doubled in the past two years.  The average payment to a recipient of that fund has decreased quite significantly.  In order to address the demand which, without doubt, will be there this year and given the increasing strain on families and the lower level of student supports, the &euro;3 million which was set aside last year to make up a total allocation of &euro;11 million for the payment, while it will still lead to a very difficult situation for colleges, is the absolute minimum that must be provided to ensure the fund can continue to operate in the way it has, by protecting people from falling off the bottom who are only just about able to remain in college.  <\/p><p> On the point about SUSI, it is our experience that the vast majority of colleges operate with a deadline of 31 October for payment of the student contribution charge.  The level of efficiency in processing applications by SUSI during the next month will have an impact.  Many students will not have received their grants before the deadline date.  I will ask the HEA to ensure flexibility in order that these students can avail of services in their colleges.  Last year saw a significant issue arising with regard to students who were not fully registered and not considered qualified to apply for the student assistance fund.  Students who were temporarily registered under the SUSI system while awaiting their grant were initially not considered qualified to apply for the student assistance fund, even though they badly needed assistance, until a further directive was sent from the HEA.  The same arrangement will need to be put in place this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500017#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380116100,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I refer to a point made by Deputy Derek Keating on the Growing Up in Ireland study and the correlation between findings of the early childhood development survey and the issue of behavioural problems.

The issue of prices is very topical.  I refer to the debate at the Labour Party conference across the water about prices and regulation.  I wish to underline the fact that two years ago in late November 2011 the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, launched the energy affordability strategy, the Government's strategy for tackling fuel poverty.<\/p> <p>It does not have a high profile, but it does exist.  The objective of the initiative was to bring together the various strands of policy with a view to tackling fuel poverty.  One of the issues in this regard is pricing, about which we are very concerned.  Decisions in this area are now out of the Minister's hands and subject to regulation.  As perhaps the largest price taker in Europe, Ireland is very exposed to high and rising energy costs.  That is why the amount of money and time we have had to devote to the energy issue has mushroomed, a situation which is unsustainable for the organisation.<\/p><p> Budgeting issues are also key.  We have been at pains to encourage people to use prepayment or pay-as-you-go meters.  This is very relevant from both a social protection and an income point of view.  The use of prepayment meters through the three established utility companies is one of the key ways in which people can make their energy bills a little more affordable and assume greater control of their budgeting.  We receive very positive feedback from the people we are assisting who avail of these facilities.  The meters are provided free of charge for clients in arrears by either ESB Customer Supply or Bord G&aacute;is Customer Supply, depending on whether the customer uses gas or electricity.  However, the vast majority in difficulty are on repayment or instalment plans and a prepayment meter, therefore, will only get them so far.  Many of our customers have defaulted on a repayment or instalment plan and there is a subsequent renegotiation or rescheduling of it.  The monitoring of these arrangements is very important in making energy bill repayments more manageable for people.<\/p><p> We asked for the carbon tax to be hypothecated and ring-fenced, but this was not done.  Instead, the moneys went into the common pot.  The effectiveness of the strategy is compromised as a result because the resources are not there to ensure retrofitting takes place as quickly as we would like.  A key issue which is tied to the social housing output issue is that, historically, housing standards have been extremely poor in this country compared with those in other northern European countries.  This has a bearing in terms of building energy ratings, with many people effectively paying to heat the sky.  A huge portion of the social protection budget is expended on fuel allowance and the various free schemes.  While we are anxious that they be protected, we realise there is something very wrong in that level of expenditure merely serving to compensate for very poor energy efficiency levels.<\/p><p> There was an indication this morning that an acceleration of the retrofitting scheme might be included as part of a possible stimulus package, if there was some wriggle room in the NewERA moneys.  That would be a win-win outcome, being pro-job creation, pro-health, pro-environment and, in the longer term, offering a better balance between income supports and retrofitting targets.  The winter fuel allowance and the free schemes or payments in lieu of energy units must be protected.  In the longer term, however, we need to see some relationship between what we are paying in income supports and the energy efficiency of housing.  These issues must somehow be coupled.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must talk to one another if there is to be more effective co-ordination on the issue.  In short, the energy issue is absolutely key for us and an important income support consideration.<\/p><p> The issues of retrofitting, building quality and so on are also relevant when it comes to a discussion on social housing.  My colleague, Ms Deane, will deal specifically with the social welfare allowance end of it, but I will make some general points.  <\/p><p> The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is itself a social housing provider, with some 1,000 units at our disposal.  The main difficulty in this area is the failure by Governments over many years to establish a robust housing policy underpinned by a robust commitment to social housing, whether through local authorities or the voluntary and co-operative movement.  There are many lessons to be learned from the Dutch and other northern European neighbours in avoiding an approach which residualises housing, assigning it as simply a private matter for landlords, a sector at which money may sometimes be thrown, not one in which the State would have oversight or give direction.<\/p> <p>Successive Governments have relinquished their responsibility in respect of the creation of quality, affordable and sustainable communities through housing provision.<\/p><p> The final point I will make is that there remains an oversupply of housing and vacant units.  However, these are not all located in the places where people either currently are or where they should be.  Our colleagues in Threshold have already stated there will be a great deal of demand in respect of the stimulus package.  Output of social housing must be increased.  It is not sufficient to state we have units available and that we can fill them with people in Longford or Carrick-on-Shannon when the demand is actually in urban areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500018#X00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Mark McCafferty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380116700,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I will quickly mention housing and rent supplement.  We could use up all of our time before this committee decrying the &euro;500 million spent on rent supplement, but there would not be any point in doing so.  To give Deputy Willie O'Dea some insights, the families and households with which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul work and which, unfortunately, are at the wrong of the food chain with regard to private rented sector accommodation are the most vulnerable.  The interaction between social welfare payments and taxation makes it difficult for people with families to genuinely consider taking up employment.  This is almost an unemployment trap and is a huge challenge for Ireland.  Deputy Willie O'Dea also referred to single males and stated that while the poverty line for such individuals was &euro;204, their incomes from social welfare payment was &euro;188.  The latter amount is &euro;186 if the person concerned is on supplementary welfare assistance, of which &euro;32 goes towards rent.  The sums just do not add up in this regard.  We are aware of top-ups and double-tenancy agreements.  We have contributed our insights on these matters and are aware that the housing assistance payment and the RAS will - technicalities dealt with aside - assist us in getting to a better place in the coming years.  We simply cannot continue to spend &euro;500 million on rent supplement and that is not the solution.<\/p><p>  On preschool services, the early child care supplement introduced by the previous Government which cost &euro;486 million per year was not a particularly good use of taxation because it left no legacy of improved quality.  It was simply a direct cash payment to parents and did nothing to improve the infrastructure, quality or standards in the sector.  These are all in sore need of reinforcement.  We spend 0.1% on the early years sector.  For the information of Deputy McConalogue, we set out a range of the resources needed to develop the sector further.  There should not be any move to row back on what is already in place, namely, the free preschool year for four year olds.  In times of recession and retrenchment other countries have managed to ring-fence funding for this most precious cohort.  We all know the statistics and economic arguments involved in respect of the return on investment, etc.  However, I will not bore members by discussing them now.  What I will say is this is a critical sector and quite an amount of development is required in it.<\/p><p>  There is no after-school care infrastructure in place.  In that context, we are deeply concerned about the activation of the lone-parent cohort.  We are so concerned about the people concerned that we are carrying out research on how they are going to cope with the lack of resources when they are activated in the workforce.  This matter does not just relate to lone parents.  Any working parent is concerned about the huge cost implications of after-school care.  We hope we can contribute to developing the architecture for the relevant strategy under the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  We have great hopes for it.<\/p><p>  To end on a positive note, we have a very innovative initiative in respect of school means which, in our view, does not cost a great deal but which has great potential in reinforcing and leveraging the capacity in the school meals sector.  Schools are a fabulous setting in which to encourage the provision of healthy and nutritional food for disadvantaged children, in particular.  We are aware of the statistics in this regard.  One in five children goes to bed or school hungry because there is not enough food in his or her home.<\/p> <p>We also know that one in six children do not have breakfast during the week.  There are many statistics on this area and I am not going to shower them on the members at this late stage in the afternoon as they have a good deal to get through.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, has so far successfully protected the school meals scheme which costs &euro;37 million.  It has amazing potential to be leveraged.  The Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection, Health, and Children and Youth Affairs should co-operate to contribute towards providing a budget that would be ring-fenced to improve potential outcomes.  We know that the Health and Food for All organisation, which has huge competences and experience in this area, is engaging directly with the Department of Social Protection.  We very much hope that the members will support the fact that the continuation of the school meals project is a no-brainer, and there are great solutions here that are ready to be applied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500020#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Audry Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380117000,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Did Ms Fahey wish to add a comment about child benefit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2013092500021#AA00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380117000,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Our position in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is that we are supportive of a payment to all families with children supplemented with extra targeted payments for those on the lowest incomes.

When we are out meeting people, we hear on the doorsteps that a husband or a wife might have been offered a job but by taking it up they could stand to lose &euro;40 or &euro;50 when they subtract all the allowances they would lose and factor in the cost of petrol money and travel expenses.  I welcome that the Minister is examining this issue.  Everything in terms of benefits should not be taken from these people.  They should assisted in the same way as recipients of the back to work scheme whereby they would be given an amount in year one, another amount in year two and a further amount in year three until they are up and running and into the system.

Does it represent a secular society or a Muslim society?

A Europe without Turkey would be confined to its own continent.  A Turkey without the values and principles of harmonisation with Europe would be confined or would become a prison.

That is why we also welcome the positive agenda in our EU accession committee given by the European Commissioner, Mr. &Scaron;tefan F&uuml;le.<\/p><p> The main issue of meetings such as this is the working out of the mutual basis of Irish-Turkish public opinion on Turkish EU membership.  If we really believe Turkish membership is the right direction for Europe and Turkey, we need to work genuinely on bringing public opinion to view it more positively.  If any committee members visit our country, we would welcome them to view membership not as an abstract concept but one that would have positive developments on working conditions, for example.

In respect of Deputy Byrne's questions, Turkey is a secular rather than Islamic country.  We have always been connected with western and European values and have always tried to go in that direction.  We have been advising neighbouring countries that their future is in democracy and democratic values.  When our prime minister visited Egypt, he also mentioned the issue of secularism because, as members know, the Muslim Brotherhood has religion at the forefront of its agenda.  Our prime minister advised it to think about secularism and to move towards becoming a secular country.  This was considered strange even by some religious people in Turkey.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of Cyprus, I do not expect any positive developments in the near future.  The current situation does not help Turkish-EU relations and Turkey's accession to the EU because Cyprus has been blocking the opening of some of the chapters for some time.  We have had very good commercial relations with the EU and if one was to look at the volume of our foreign trade, 50% of it is with EU countries.  The percentage has decreased from 60% to 50% but it is only the percentage that has decreased.  Otherwise, the trade volume is at the same level.  The decrease in the percentage is due to our increasing trade volume with countries outside the EU.  In the near future, our trade volume with the EU will increase although the percentage will stay the same or decrease.  If one was to look at our trade volume of $300 billion, $150 billion is with EU countries, including imports and exports in total.  This will increase to $200 billion in the near future.<\/p><p>  In respect of Deputy Kyne's comments, the public support for Turkey's EU membership has been decreasing very recently.  It was around 60% but has been following a downward trend and is now around 40%.  This has been fluctuating over time but if one was to look at the past three to five years, one would see that even though relations between Turkey and the EU have been increasing, there has been a decrease in support for Turkey's EU membership.  There are a number of reasons for this.  One of them is the loss of enthusiasm and belief that Turkey will one day become a full member of the EU.  The second reason relates to announcements by famous parliamentarians to their constituencies in order to carry on their domestic issues.   <\/p><p>  There will not be a large amount of migration from Turkey to the EU.  If we look at recent economic developments in Turkey, we can see that many Turkish people who migrated earlier to Europe are now returning to Turkey.  Therefore, I do not expect to see migration from Turkey to the EU akin to that from Romania or Bulgaria to the EU.  Turkey is a dynamic country and many people will come back.  It will be the other way around.  Instead of migration from Turkey to EU countries, we will see migration of Turkish people living in EU countries back to Turkey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013092500005#D00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ruhi Acikgoz"},{"type":"speech","time":1380114900,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I have one question before we conclude.  When I visited Turkey earlier in the year, I met the mayor of Beyo\u011flu in Istanbul.  He told me about his plans for the centre of Istanbul and the proposals to redevelop parts of the city.  It was just after I left that we saw an element of unrest on the streets of Istanbul and throughout Turkey.  I know from recent news reports that there is still some unrest out there.  Could Mr. Acikgoz give us his views on what the situation is and how he thinks it can be resolved for everybody's benefit?<\/p> <p>I will try to give my views on this issue.  I believe it will be very beneficial for the committee to listen to my colleague from the main opposition party so she will brief it about the opinion of the opposition.  In my view, this started with an attempt to rebuild Gezi Park in Istanbul as it appeared in the past.  When our Prime Minister announced this project to the public, some artists began to protest against it.  An intervention took place and all sides admitted that the force used was disproportionate.  There were investigations into what took place and some cases have been brought to court and are still in progress.  We have also declared that even though the decision coming out of these courts would be in favour of the project, we would still opt for a plebiscite and ask the opinion of the public in Istanbul.  <\/p><p> This began with respect to environmental sensitivity but evolved into a political protest in Turkey.  There were major uprisings in major cities where the resignation of the Prime Minister was asked for.  Demonstrations did not take place during the school summer holidays.  There were expectations that this unrest would resume after the end of the school holidays but we have not seen that happen.  These have become politicised and we believe that the events that began about Gezi Park are now evolving into demonstrations that relate to the issue of Syria as well.  We are working on a package to convince public opinion.  This has become a political issue and this democratic package will be announced by our Prime Minister this weekend.  We hope to meet some of the requirements and demands of people regarding freedom and human rights issues so that these issues cannot be used as an excuse for these kinds of demonstrations.  Although they are few in number, some radical groups are trying to make use of these kinds of demonstrations and issues to destabilise Turkey.  It is not widespread but as I mentioned, the committee should also listen to the perspective of the opposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013092500005#D00200","speaker":"1076","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380115200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Would Ms Pavey like to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013092500006#E00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380115200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>To sum up because it is a large issue, I strongly believe that the Gezi Park protests were not political demonstrations.  They were not for democracy and did not relate to an ethnic struggle.  They were about the same old and prolonged social divide between the modern and the traditional coming to the surface.  Those peaceful protesters who were unfortunately exposed to the extreme use of force by the police and brutal attacks were representing the further clipping away of social freedoms and rights.  It was a social explosion that was inter-generational and inter-class.  It was just one platform for the youngsters who were pushed away from the cliff of the city to make them invisible in a city that takes its radiance from their humour, joy and modern education.  They were asked to be invisible and they resisted and braved an onslaught to save a few trees in a small park that is perhaps one of the few small spaces in my city in which to breathe.<\/p><p>  What did they want?  Like everybody else including us, they wanted a modern education, to be proud of their jobs, to perhaps kiss freely in public if they wanted to and to walk and have good public transportation in their city.  They just wanted social freedoms and to live as happily as possible.  This is the social segment at which we are looking.  It is very sad that in the following witch hunt, which is ongoing, many people lost their public jobs and many of the youngsters who had been profiled by the police might never have the opportunity of public work.  <\/p><p>  This is why the EU roadmap is very important.  Those youngsters have shown us the newest face of Turkey and we need to look at it very carefully.  They have shown the desire to live by universal rights, values and freedoms.  That is significant and is the reason we are pushing for chapters 23 and 24 to be opened concretely in the EU talks.  That is why the outcome is very important for us and those peaceful protesters.  The environment chapter is also on the table between the two parties so perhaps that is where we need more progress in respect of a participatory democratic role for local authorities.  That will also be an important question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013092500006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Safak Pavey"},{"type":"speech","time":1380115200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their answers to our questions and for attending this meeting.

When the banks were before us a fortnight ago, there were many complaints from the public listening in or watching the meeting and from the press room - the press may not have been in the Press Gallery but were watching the proceedings on monitors - because they were not able to hear what was happening due to sound distortions caused by electronic equipment.  Having a telephone or an iPad on silent mode is not sufficient.  If Members' iPads use a 3G system they will need to turn off the cellular connection and operate strictly on Wi-Fi.  The same applies to laptops and other electronic devices.<\/p><p>  With the technical lesson out the way, we move on to matters relating to the economy, including mortgage resolution, banking and credit provision.  I welcome Professor Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Governor previously appeared before the committee on 16 January.  We are pleased to welcome back the Professor.<\/p><p>  Professor Honohan will make opening remarks, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.  Before we start, I remind members, witnesses and those in the public galleries to switch off all mobile phones.   I advise the witness that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  Professor Honohan will recall from my correspondence to him that I am looking explicitly for information on the areas which arose from our recent meetings with the banks.  I indicated that he might define what is an acceptable, sustainable solution in dealing with distressed mortgages, together with the datasets that are to be used to ensure uniformity of reporting for direct comparative purposes.  An issue that the committee looked at when the banks were before us was how we will be able to make comparisons between them because when they brought their formulas to us there was no uniformity in their approaches.  Another issue to consider is how debt resolution may be looked at post-retirement.  Finally, when we spoke to some of the banks they told us they used modelling that was not prescribed in the resolution processes, which included concessions on mortgages.  We are interested in hearing Professor Honohan's thoughts on those matters in his opening comments or in the course of our engagement this afternoon.  I invite Professor Honohan to make his opening comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500003#F00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380114000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to speak on the complicated issue of mortgage arrears.  I also welcome the opportunity to explain the Central Bank's policy on other matters that the committee may wish to raise.<\/p><p>  My opening remarks will be a bit longer than usual, but the committee deserves and is entitled to that.  I have previously discussed with the committee the extremely slow progress that was being made by the banks in arresting the growth in mortgage arrears, processing the cases that had fallen into arrears and implementing sustainable solutions.  Things are still not moving as quickly as the Central Bank would prefer; the indications are that the process is working, momentum is building, but there is some way to go. <\/p><p>  What is the Central Bank's goal in addressing the problem of mortgage arrears?  Its approach has been driven by both of its main regulatory objectives, prudential supervision and consumer protection.  The consumer protection goal of fair and reasonable treatment has been targeted through, for example, the CCMA, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, to which I will refer to later.  The mortgage arrears targets have been crafted using the prudential powers, though there will also be a side benefit to the consumer.  We have manoeuvred our powers to achieve the results that are needed for the nation.  Figuring out exactly how to achieve these important policy goals while working within constitutional, legal and practical realities has presented novel challenges to the Central Bank.  Although progress is still too slow, I am satisfied that the approach is correct and is progressively yielding results. <\/p><p>  It is almost two years since the Central Bank launched the mortgage arrears resolution strategy which has steadily ramped up requirements on banks to improve their policies, processes and staffing around this issue in order to accelerate results on the ground.  In March, as part of this process, and with a view to enhancing measurability of progress, the Central Bank introduced a regime of quantitative targets for ensuring that sustainable solutions are found more quickly for distressed mortgages.<\/p> <p>The banks having reported compliance with the first quarterly set of targets and the Central Bank has started the process of auditing a sample of the cases to see whether the solutions proposed by the banks can truly be regarded as sustainable.  The internal guidelines under which this audit will be carried out have been finalised and posted on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website.  They have been on the website in draft form for the past three months, but despite our nudging and pointing people towards them there has not been much, if any, public commentary on them.  They have been finalised and we are starting to work with consultants on the audits.<\/p><p> The question of what is sustainable is key.  In a nutshell, a sustainable arrangement is one which is affordable for the borrower in both the short and the long term, and provides sufficient clarity on what happens to the collateral at maturity.  The guidelines seek to put sufficient flesh on this basic concept to allow the criterion to be audited, while not being so restrictive as to prevent innovation in solution design.  There is much concern about the initiation of legal proceedings and it is a big part of this exercise.  The March 2013 targets document set out three modes of generating a sustainable solution.  The first, preferred, type of solution is an arrangement where payments are re-established on the original schedule, if it can be afforded, or an agreed revised schedule.  This is a re-arrangement or restructuring.  The second mode is where the borrower opts for a personal insolvency arrangement.  This was not available to borrowers at the end of June so there are none of these in the first wave.  The third mode, available to the bank only where an arrangement could not be reached or is not appropriate, involves voluntary surrender or repossession of the property.<\/p><p> Although each of the banks has reported compliance with the targets for the end of June 2013, it is notable, though perhaps not surprising, that more than 60% of this initial wave has followed the third mode.  I have provided committee members with a table showing the aggregate figure and the mix between restructures and voluntary surrender or repossession of principal dwelling homes and buy-to-let properties.<\/p><p> With regard to why the banks have relied so heavily on initiating legal proceedings in the first wave of actions under the mortgage arrears resolution targets scheme, subject to verification in the audit process, it is possible most of these cases involve protracted periods of arrears with limited co-operation from the borrower, notably in providing the information needed by the lender to arrive at a better solution.  We have only reports from the banks and are interacting with them to obtain more particulars; we do not have the result of the audit.  Up-to-date borrower information provided to the lender is essential if the lender is to design a better sustainable solution potentially not involving repossession.  Neither the lenders nor the Central Bank expect repossession will be the preferred solution in the end for most of these cases.  In most cases, engagement by the borrower will make the legal course unnecessary.  If so, as always the best course of action for the borrower is to start to engage by providing the necessary information to the bank to find out what better course is available.<\/p><p> The Central Bank&rsquo;s code of conduct on mortgage arrears provides a strong protection framework for borrowers who engage with their lenders.  Under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, lenders are required to engage proactively with their customers to help them address the situation; they must carry out a full assessment of the borrower&rsquo;s situation based on the standard financial statement and each case must be examined on its individual merits.  Lenders are required to explore all their options and where they do not offer an alternative repayment arrangement they must inform the borrower of the reasons for this and what alternatives are available.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession only where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement.  The banks are not simply complying with our targets for sustainable solutions, by law they must comply with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.<\/p><p> I must stress the Central Bank has no mandate to prevent lenders proceeding to repossession if the borrowers refuse to engage, provided the lender has followed the procedures mandated in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Any bank proceeding lightly to legal recourse with co-operating borrowers without satisfying the procedures of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, or where alternative sustainable arrangements are available, is evidently not acting in a manner consistent with the targets regime.  This should be detected through the audit and corrective action would be required.<\/p><p> Let us stand back and ask how household debt has become such a big problem.  That household mortgage debt would represent the biggest potential source of loan losses after developer loans was evident from an early stage in the crisis.  It was also clear the problem would not emerge all at once, but would grow as distressed borrowers ran through their savings and, to the extent that unemployment was the problem, found it more difficult than they expected to secure a new job.  The ultimate scale of the problem has been hard to predict and we did not expect the banks to be so persistently ineffective in getting their arms around this problem and delivering sustainable solutions.  The best available sustainable solutions can take several forms.  Some merely involve identifying where the defaults are not justifiable given household resources, and such borrowers need to be brought back on track.  Others, especially buy-to-lets, may involve a surrender of the property to the bank or its assisted sale, with some sustainable treatment of the shortfall.  In other cases, the lender cannot be confident of recovering all of the loan, but can be protected against the risk of forgiving more than is needed by the device of a split mortgage.  Other schemes are possible.  None of these arrangements is ideal.  They generally imply a great disappointment for the borrower and a loss for the lender relative to what was originally envisaged, and I am sure such language is an understatement.<\/p><p> The Central Bank is not empowered, nor could it be, to insist on debt forgiveness for any particular borrower.  Relief for an insolvent borrower from indebtedness is determined ultimately through the insolvency procedures for which legislation has so recently been reformed and in a direction which is rightly much more favourable to the insolvent debtor than previous legislation.  The Central Bank helped to advise on the drafting of this legislation and has been supportive of its aims.  Use of the legislation will be an important means of ensuring over-indebtedness problems, especially those involving multiple debtors, can be resolved.  The point of the targets is that it should be possible for lenders to avoid imposing the costs and delays of a personal insolvency arrangement or bankruptcy on many insolvent debtors by coming to sustainable negotiated solutions which are better for both borrower and lender.<\/p><p> There has been much talk about split mortgages.  With regard to whether this is the Central Bank&rsquo;s preferred outcome, various types of solution are possible to deal with a situation where the initial repayment promise looks unsustainable.  If appropriately designed, and the criteria have been set out in the sustainability guidelines, a split mortgage can be a sustainable solution depending on the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.  It can allow the lender to take explicit account of future improvements in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances, while providing the borrower sufficient assurance of affordability now and in the future.  However, it provides only one of several possible approaches.  Banks have begun to experiment with other models which can give them and the borrowers the assurance the repayment will be back on a firm basis.  The Central Bank does not advocate any particular solution but it must be sustainable.<\/p><p> The committee mentioned an approach outlined by Ulster Bank, and without going into detail the high-level response is that on the face of it this approach seems to have most of the ingredients needed to be considered sustainable.  While the Central Bank has set out its sustainability guidelines, nobody, least of all borrowers, would be served by the Central Bank attempting to place a narrow straitjacket preventing innovation around possible solutions within the guidelines, and the Ulster Bank approach may be an example of this.  Banks are beginning to learn from experience the elements which differentiate an ineffective engagement with arrears customers from the kind of engagement leading to an arrangement which is not only sustainable, but is in fact sustained because it matches the borrower&rsquo;s abilities and motivation.  Some banks have gone further than others down this road.<\/p><p> With regard to whether the banks should be doing more to achieve sustainability, despite all of our efforts, and despite real progress in policies, processes and staffing, far too many arrears cases have remained untreated, whether sustainably or not.  For example, of 98,000 personal dwelling home accounts more than 90 days in arrears at the end of June, 74,000, or three out of every four, were not yet in an arrangement.<\/p> <p> Why have the banks been so slow in acting?  It may be, as many have suggested, that the delay in correcting the legislative defect identified by the Dunne judgment represented a delay, although it should not have deterred non-repossession actions.  The moratorium, which was enforced by the Central Bank, and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, restrictions, which are designed to prevent harassment by debt collectors, have likely contributed to some delay, but they have also been used by lenders as excuses.  In any event, the moratorium and other CCMA rules have been streamlined in such a way as to retain sufficient protections for distressed borrowers - a legitimate and important objective - while generating little or no obstacle to efficiently organised collection procedures.  The legislative defect identified in the Dunne judgment has also eventually been corrected, as we had recommended.  More important has been the fact that the task required a much more focused and effective organisational effort at scale than the banks at first realised, a deficiency that they have been progressively overcoming - with pressure from us, of course - since we started to audit and critique their procedures more intensively in 2011.  This is ongoing in parallel with the targets.<\/p><p> There is also a gap between the analysis of the Central Bank and that of some of the banks with regard to the need for clarity and predictability about the solutions being proposed.  The Central Bank wants to be sure that there is sufficient clarity about the arrangement, for example, in regard to the treatment of the borrower's liability for the shortfall in a loan following an assisted sale or repossession or for the warehoused part of a split mortgage.  Some of the banks have expressed the opinion that a degree of uncertainty about how these elements will be treated could help ensure that they recover as much as possible.  The Central Bank believes the contrary.  With such a widespread systemic problem of debtor distress, greater clarity on what is residually owed in these circumstances is safer for the lender - it is also better for the borrower, of course - in guarding against any erosion of the debt servicing culture, as well as helping a broader restoration of household confidence, which will help the wider economic recovery and, through that, boost loan recoverability, which is the banks' concern.  In particular, the Central Bank regards as unwise the creation of a situation where, because of such uncertainty, the lender and borrower hold inconsistent expectations about what will be enforced and recovered on a particular loan.<\/p><p> There has been a degree of wishful thinking among some of the banks, a belief that many cases will cure themselves even without energetic action by the lenders.  Leaving well enough alone is not, however, an adequate approach.  Delay worsens the prospects for both lender and borrower.  This truism is now being acted upon more expeditiously.  The Central Bank does not have executive or management control of the banks' operations.

On the issue of sustainability in relation to mortgages, the definition in this regard appears to be the ability of a person in financial distress to meet some level of obligation in order to remain in the family home.  I am speaking in this regard predominantly about residential mortgages rather than those taken out on buy-to-let properties.  I would like to tease out the following issue which I raised in correspondence earlier this year with Professor Honohan.  Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Bank and Ulster Bank have stated that at this time they are prohibited from engaging in resolution processes that run into the time of retirement.  For example, where a person is in positive equity and in receipt of a decent pension and can well service the interest proportion of his or her loan and, possibly, even pay a proportion of the capital, the banks are not allowed to engage in a resolution process with that person.

I think the concept of strategic defaults is a phony concept.  There is a huge variety of circumstances where people are not paying their mortgage fully.  There can be all sorts of reasons for it.  It can be that they cannot afford to pay all of their debts and they have decided, rightly or wrongly, that they will pay the short-term debt first because they think they will be able to get back on target with the mortgage.  That could be very common.  One might find that the banks who hold the mortgage are saying that this is terrible as people are paying everything else, but not the bank.  However, is that strategic default?  That is people managing their affairs as best they can.  They might also be prioritising things that it is unrealistic to prioritise.  It is certainly true that they might not realise that they have to adjust their living standards.  It is complex.  I am not prepared to say, \"I have looked at this and the number is 25\", because I do not know what the concept means.<\/p><p>  We have been doing the type of research mentioned by the Deputy.  I referred to it in a speech a couple of months ago and I am told we will be publishing some material of that type, but it will not say what the percentage of strategic defaults is.  With regard to the payment of debt, will all of the mortgages that are in arrears now be paid in full or substantially in full by the end or will none of them be paid in full?  I am sure that many of the mortgages that are not being fully paid now will eventually come back on track and be fully paid.  That means there are arrears now which do not reflect the true ultimate situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500008#L00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1380117000,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I am glad the Governor has broken his silence on that issue today.

He said in the statement that no new issues have been identified relating to suspected criminal offences that require any further statutory reports of suspected offences to the authorities.  It is not for me or any other individual to reach conclusions as to whether criminality existed at that or any other bank, but it is fair to point out that the broad mass of Irish society was shocked when those tapes were aired publicly and reported on in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  Most people find it incomprehensible that the matters were not at least referred to the authorities and let them, as the competent bodies, assess whether there was any wrongdoing that required further action by way of prosecutions.

My grandfather was a sub-editor in the<i> Irish Independent<\/i> and he would turn in his grave to see our very legalistic statement turned into &quot;Central Bank sees no wrong&quot; - yes, it does see wrong - and &quot;Central Bank gives clean bill of health&quot; - absolutely not.

It was not to stop anything, and it does not stop anything.  We owe it to the public not to pretend that we have sufficient new evidence of criminality.

The fact is that Bank of Ireland is charging a normal interest rate on its split mortgage and it has only given 19 of them up to the end of June.  He said that the banks have evolved more in regard to the products that they are putting out.  PermanentTSB has gone from 1,000 assisted voluntary sales at the end of June to 2,000 at the end of September.  I would like to hear the Governor's comment on that particular point.  <\/p><p>  Third, the Governor went on record a number of months ago but it is not in his statement today.  This is nothing personal; this is business.  He is on record as saying that the banks have adequate capital and, in a best case scenario, they got &euro;5.8 billion of taxpayers' money in June 2011 to deal with the issue of write-offs in the banks.  Does he believe that they adequately capitalised to deal with that measure at this particular time?  <\/p><p>  Fourth, with regard to the targets that are set down by the banks, it is about putting sustainable solutions in place.  I ask the Governor to deal with those points.  The banks are not moving fast enough.  Are they, in reality, capitalised?  Perhaps he will comment on the inconsistencies between the treatments or solutions that are provided by the various institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500009#M07900","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1380117600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>That is the Deputy's last question because it will take time for the Governor to respond.

I will also answer the first point that Deputy Pearse Doherty made.  We are not just looking for regulatory breaches; we were looking for a link between what was in the public arena in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i> and the interaction between Anglo Irish Bank and the Central Bank.  I referred to it facetiously in response to Deputy Kieran O'Donnell and I am sorry for that.  That is what is potentially of value as a finding of evidence of some criminal activity and there was a failure to find that link.  We do not have evidence of them following up in any effective way on what the gameplan was.  That is what is missing.  Even for an attempted criminal offence, standards are higher than one might think.  We often come up against the high evidential standard and the definition of various crimes.  At the Committee of Public Accounts in June or July, Matthew Elderfield pointed out that it is very difficult to take sanctions against individuals with the structure that is in place.  Also during the summer, the British Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards produced a report based on the British banking crisis and the various things that could be done.  One of the things that it suggested, which the Central Bank has been considering for quite a while, is a novel criminal offence of reckless misconduct in the management of the bank.  The parliamentary commission recommended that offence.  We are talking about mismanagement on a large scale.  You are the Members of the Oireachtas.  We have come up against legislative barriers.<\/p><p>  With regard to the next question, the Central Bank did not have the recordings in spring 2009.

I only have a couple of minutes left.  In September 2011 and again in 2012, the Governor came in here to talk about the issue of mortgage arrears with his arms swinging, saying the banks were not doing enough and were not being aggressive enough and that the Central Bank was breathing down their necks, but the arrears crisis has got worse.  I put it to him, as I have done before, that he is the top dog.  He is the person who can actually force the banks to do stuff.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance said yesterday on the D&aacute;il record: \"Letters threatening repossession or legal action could not in my opinion be considered as a sustainable solution under the mortgage arrears targets\".   He went on to say that repossession should only ever be considered as a last option.  He is very clearly saying that it is not in the targets.  It is not allowed to be included in the targets.  We know that AIB has issued something like 6,000 letters.  We had representatives from the Bank of Ireland saying that the letters AIB issued are not the same as the letters they issued because they actually go to the court and it is the start of a process.  Why has the Governor been silent on this?  Can the Governor not say to the committee that letters threatening repossession or legal action are not, in his opinion, considered a sustainable solution?  That is the first point.  The second is the fact that the banks are running rings around the Central Bank.  The spirit of the targets was about reaching conclusions and finding solutions for people who were in genuine mortgage distress.  Forgetting the 16,000 legal letters of repossession, it is pathetic what the banks have done in terms of real solutions.  The last time the Governor was before this committee he mentioned that if the Central Bank set targets, the targets would be reached but not in the appropriate way.  Why is the Central Bank not doing more?  We have had to wait six months after the targets were given to the Central Bank to find out if it would okay them.  Then last week the Central Bank came out with a statement to the effect that one year on from setting the targets, it was satisfied that 75% of those in mortgage distress will still not have a concluded agreement with the four banks.  We have had representatives from the four banks before this committee who were unable to agree on whether interest-only mortgages or split mortgages, with the residual debt hanging, were acceptable to the Central Bank.  There are only four or five banks involved.  How come, six months into this process, there is so much vagueness that the CEOs of the four main banks still do not know what the Central Bank means by long-term solutions to mortgage distress?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500011#O00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1380118800,"counter":371,"content":"<p>That is the Deputy's final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500011#O00900","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380118800,"counter":372,"content":"<p>The Deputy made a lot of remarks there and I am not going to challenge every one of them, obviously.

There are people who would say we should not be interfering with what the banks are doing.  I am not in that space.  The banks will complain that we are pushing them around while Deputy Doherty will say that they are running rings around us.  The net result is that the banks have not had the capacity and, to some extent, the willingness to reach sustainable solutions.  That is why we brought in the term \"sustainable\" because they have been willing to let this situation run and letting it run has contributed to a rise in the arrears because nobody can see the clear end to this process that should be evident.  We are not satisfied.<\/p><p>  Did other countries do it better?  A bit better, yes.  They started earlier.  At the time when the banks were struggling for survival here - which is not an excuse but probably the explanation - and not doing anything on the mortgages, banks in Iceland, which had been swept away and re-started, started to get to grips with it.  It has taken them three or four years but now they are well ahead of the Irish banks.  It is a question of process and effectiveness.  We have seen one of the banks, with perhaps a simpler book, with a much more effective process.  It is not soft on the borrowers but is disciplined and organised.  It has got results.  The other banks are looking around and seeing that they could and should be doing that.

Have Professor Honohan or his colleagues examined the purchase prices of the billions of Irish bonds currently held by the European Central Bank, the times of the bonds and the amount of profits that have been made on this?  Since last I raised this matter with him, has Professor Honohan discussed with any of the other central bank governors in Europe the arrangements for these profits to be given back to Ireland, in line with the agreement that was put in place in the case of Greece?  Does he believe it is appropriate that we are being discriminated against in such a way by the euro system?  I do not want to hear again that Ireland is not Greece.  Although I have read the report, I cannot put a figure on the profits.  It has been suggested that the level of the profits is &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion.  Perhaps the officials from the Central Bank can take the figures out of this study and give us a precise figure for the profits that are being made.  In light of the current discussions on what to do with &euro;500 million in our current budget, one way or another, it would be of benefit if we could get our hands on this possible &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion.  Can Professor Honohan give me a precise figure in this regard?  I know the money is shared around the different central banks.  We will get some small amount of that profit.

My comments will focus on mortgage arrears in the buy-to-let sector.  Since the beginning of 2013, the number of receivers appointed to landlords' interests in buy-to-let properties under the deed of mortgage has increased significantly.  As the Governor is aware, having referred to the matter, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, which was recently passed by the Seanad, will facilitate the recovery through the courts of a greater number of buy-to-let properties.  I note from the documentation provided by the Central Bank that, by the end of June 2013, of the buy-to-let mortgages where solutions had been proposed, 74% were either to be surrendered or legal action was to be taken.  This figure significantly exceeds the solutions provided in the principal dwelling sector.<\/p><p>  The rental sector accounts for 20% of the entire housing market.  Families live in rented dwelling and, as the property market recovers, they fear that greater problems will emerge.  There is evidence that receivers are entering properties, taking rents from tenants, treating them as the legal occupiers and seeking to remove them without giving appropriate notice.<\/p><p>  Professor Honohan indicated the Central Bank's approach was not only about achieving regulatory objectives but also involved consumer protection.  There appears to be no consumer protection available to tenants in buy-to-let properties.  Given that the mortgages for such properties were granted on the basis that the properties would be let, damage to tenants in the sector was reasonably foreseeable.  Guidance issued recently by the Irish Banking Federation appears to indicate that, while it is perfectly fine for tenants to pay rents to receivers under deeds of mortgage, the receiver has no obligation to the tenant in respect of repairs.  I do not regard this as reasonable consumer protection.  Does the Governor have any comment to make on the issue?<\/p><p>  Similarly, the Governor indicated the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is designed to protect consumers.  A code of conduct is not available for buy-to-let mortgage arrears.  If such a code were in place, it would ensure greater transparency among the financial institutions and by landlords and tenants and ensure the financial institutions respected and upheld tenants rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500013#Q01400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1380120000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I suggest the Senator ask a question, after which she can interact with the Governor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500013#Q01500","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1380120000,"counter":435,"content":"<p>Everything I have said is essentially a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500013#Q01600","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1380120000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I am trying to be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500013#Q01700","speaker":"1060"},{"type":"speech","time":1380120000,"counter":437,"content":"<p>The issue is the treatment of the buy-to-let market.

As always, he is showing openness in his interaction with us.  The Governor noted in his opening statement that the early indications suggest this process is working.  In my opinion, the contrary is the case and the process is not working, certainly not in the interests of the economic recovery of the country.  We see a major variation in the type and quality of offers the banks are making to borrowers and in differences in the behaviour of the banks in terms of what is acceptable.  Some are engaging in very good behaviour, while others are engaging in very bad behaviour.<\/p><p>  The joint committee has observed that a large number of the so-called solutions offered so far are either legal letters or what I would describe as \"extend and pretend\" solutions, that is, term extensions and so forth.  When representatives of several of the banks appeared before us recently, their chief executives stated that, as a matter of banking policy, they will not engage in any write-downs of debt, notwithstanding the requirement to do so as part of the insolvency legislation.  If the banks do not provide write-downs, where it is appropriate to do so, citizens will be forced into unnecessary bankruptcy.  <\/p><p>  The reason the process is not working is that arrears are not the problem but a symptom of the problem.  <\/p> <p>The problem is that many Irish households have too much debt relative to their current and near-term income.  I believe the process as it is playing out will just hide the problem.  Let us say, for example, that all the arrears are cleared by the end of next year.  Then, as this is played out, the quantum of debt will, by and large, be the same, as the level of household income.  Ergo, the problem will not have been resolved but will simply have been hidden.  There is a huge opportunity to get this right, if we can mandate solutions like debt wreck and if we can, for example, stop Bank of Ireland from pretending that charging the full amount of interest on the shelved proportion is anything other the normal loan split in half.  I believe that Mr. Honohan, as Governor, is a key person to do this.<\/p><p> Who is in charge?  My understanding was that up until recently, the Central Bank did not have much power to direct the banks.  Therefore, in preparation for the meeting today, I took a look back at the new Central Bank Act which came into effect in July, which gives the Central Bank significant new powers.  Part 7 of the Act gives the Central Bank power to issue directions to the banks.  One of these powers is that if a financial institution is conducting business in a manner that could jeopardise or prejudice the rights and interests of customers, the Central Bank can direct that bank.  This means the Central Bank could give a direction and part of that direction would be to tell the banks how they can operate.  Part 8 deals with the type of regulations the Central Bank can make, one of which is a provision specifying requirements which are to apply in regard to the provision of financial services to a customer for the purpose of determining the suitability of the financial services to the customer etc., provisions about making loans available etc.<\/p><p> I am not a lawyer, but in Mr. Honohan's opinion does he now have the power he needs, if he so chooses, to direct the banks?  For example, could he say to Bank of Ireland that the Central Bank will not allow it use its pretend split mortgage.  Could the Central Bank tell all of the banks they must use debt for equity in conditions it deems acceptable.  Does the Central Bank have the power to do that or does the Oireachtas need to give further legislative authority to it to get this process moving properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500013#Q02600","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380120600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>My impression is that we have the powers we need to get this done.

It is a question of what we can force them to do that will induce them to act on a case by case basis that will deliver the results we want.  I would be fearful that if we lock them into a situation where they must do one thing and not another, in a specific directive that would straitjacket them, the banks will say they no longer care what they do and will just follow mechanically the instructions provided by the Central Bank.

Many people who are not in arrears are in deep hardship trying to make their monthly payments.

This has led to a consequence of further austerity that is still grinding down our economy and our people.  Professor Honohan was prepared, along with his colleagues in Europe, to allow the private debts of the perpetrators to be underwritten on the backs of the Irish working class people, but there was nothing whatsoever for the victims who are the mortgage holders and the young generation of workers who were blackmailed into paying these horrific speculative prices for property.<\/p><p> I would like to comment on split mortgages.

I will summarise what the banks have said last week at the committee and what the Governor has said.  The banks said, more or less: \"We lent in good faith - maybe a bit recklessly.  A big financial crash came along and people are in difficulty but we have the right to get our money back off mortgage holders.  If they would only just engage with us, because we really want to engage with them, we will be fair and reasonable with them.  The problem is that too many people are strategically defaulting or not engaging with us.\"<\/p><p>  Professor Honohan has given a slightly more critical narrative in that he probably says: \"The banks are not doing as good a job as they could.\"  Broadly speaking, however, he is going along with the idea that heading along the current trajectory will mean it will be all right on the night with the current framework.  I put it to the Governor that the banks are telling us an absolute fairy tale, that the Governor is blindly optimistic about what is actually going on and that there is a financial bomb likely to explode on the balance sheets of the banks, with pretty devastating consequences for our economy and for the citizens of that economy.<\/p><p>  I want to illustrate that point with an example which, in my view, is typical.  I will not mention names.  A young couple from D&uacute;n Laoghaire, both working and with a low to middle income, take out a mortgage to buy a house in Wexford.  They do not want to live in Wexford.  Back in the day, the bank offers them money to buy a house in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  They decline because they believe they would never be able to afford it.  They decide they want to get on the property ladder but they decide to be sensible and go to Wexford and hope eventually to work their way back to D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The crash comes.  Their income has decreased by about 20%.  The house they bought for &euro;250,000 is now worth &euro;80,000 to &euro;90,000.  Payments were at about &euro;1,200 a month and they are now just about able to pay &euro;700, and barely so.  This is a less than interest-only arrangement, which means the debt is building up on them.  The woman becomes pregnant and very soon will be unable to work so that their income will drop even more.  For two years they write to the bank, begging for a permanent solution.  All they get from the bank is moratoriums, temporary solutions and so on.  Only when I raised the issue with the chief executive officer of that bank at a committee meeting when I said the bank was not engaging with the customers, does this couple finally get an appointment to meet the bank.  At that meeting the bank representatives offer them another temporary arrangement whereby, because things may turn around and perhaps in a year or two, some sort of split mortgage can be considered.  The couple, quite rightly, decline.  They say they are sinking into a mire of debt and such an arrangement is no good to them.

When we started out, were letters ever intended to be part of resolution?  The reason I ask that question is that when the banks were before the committee they said that this was a really good trick and that they invented the idea of the letters so as to postpone matters.  There was almost a smirk on the faces of the bankers.<\/p> <p>A letter costs 60 cent or something and does nothing but allow them to meet in a fictional way the targets the Central Bank has set.  I refer to a second concern that arose recently.  As Professor Honohan is aware, I introduced a Bill in the Seanad to separate utility banks, zombie banks and so on and had some discussions with the Department of Finance.  There was an EU deadline with regard to submissions on structural reform and while I submitted my Bill, nothing else came in from Ireland.  We are approaching the fifth anniversary of the guarantee next Saturday, 28 September and the Department of Finance has indicated it will take up this issue in Council.  However, while the Central Bank may have done so, as far as I am aware, the Department of Finance did not send in anything.  There is that frustration that we are not getting to grips with the problem.<\/p><p> My third question pertains to the case-by-case approach.  I believe we will get nowhere with 98,000 accounts in arrears on a case by case basis.  Do we have loan-to-value or debt-to-income rules in force?  Deputies Higgins and Boyd Barrett may recall the precise numbers but in one case, a guy who owed AIB &euro;340,000 had an income of &euro;34,000.  I believe members asked whether the person who gave that loan is still working for the bank.  If one uses simple rules like an 80% loan-to-value ratio or a loan limit of two and a half times one's income, probably three quarters of that loan was reckless.  This will come back to haunt us in respect of the &euro;64 billion we gave to the banks but let us do it and stop the sending of letters and meddling around.  Professor Honohan mentioned the Oireachtas has not passed legislation on reckless lending but that case involved a debt-to-income ratio of 10:1.  While I am sure Professor Honohan already has access to it back at the bank, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has published a lot of stuff recently and as other countries work on these micro-prudential rules by changing the ratios I mentioned, are we doing this?  While members did ask some of the banks with what loan-to-value ratios they were working at present, one could still be waiting as one would not get an answer out of them.  This raises the question as to whether we really have got this sector under control, given the immense damage it did to the country.  Is there anything to be done about the education of bankers?  Alternatively, are they simply guys with smirks on their faces who have been getting away with it for five years now and who are stringing people along?  They are in fact keeping up the price of property or all around the place because they will not move towards resolution, as the Governor wishes them to do.  Moreover, resolution does not include writing letters.<\/p><p> A final point is that in the Governor's opening statement, he noted \"Others, especially buy-to-lets, may involve a surrender of the property to the bank\".  I have been trying to make the point that this property could be a person's principal private residence, which has been rented, as are the majority of properties in places like Switzerland and Germany.  As the tenant is paying and it is the landlord who is bankrupt, can one really countenance a surrender of property to the bank because it is a buy-to-let?  I cannot and must state that whoever takes that on has bought a piece of paper, that one collect rents from time to time and must pursue the landlord.  This kind of eviction appears to infringe all our ideas that a family home should be protected.  Regardless of whether it is owned with a mortgage or rented, it is a principal private residence and there is considerable concern that buy-to-let resolutions are pursuing tenants.  It is not they, but the landlords who are doing the defaulting.  I will conclude by noting Professor Honohan is very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500018#V03900","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380123600,"counter":586,"content":"<p>As for the question of letters, it was inevitable in the first stage that the banks would seek the easiest cases.  In other words, the easiest for them were those which they could justify on the basis of a long period of no payment, no engagement and so on.  Consequently, they can easily satisfy the first quarter's requirement by such pursuit but this cannot and will not be the end of the story.  However, we must make sure that the banks maintain and improve their capacity to then process the cases and not deal with them in the unsatisfactory way described by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  On legislation, I am aware there have been Private Members' initiatives on legislation in the banking area that potentially are very useful.  I will just make the point that in the last number of years, we have more or less exceeded our allocation in the legislative programme with all the financial legislation that has been required and so we probably would get short shrift on that.  However, the time may perhaps come for that in due course.<\/p><p>  On the question of loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios and controlling bank behaviour in that way, I am very much in favour of that and it could have been done in the run-up to the crisis.  It is not perhaps the most urgent pressing need now, in the sense that the issue now is in getting banks to make any loans, even with a very low loan-to-value ratio.  They are not making extravagant loans like they used.  However, it is in our toolkit and we can activate those sorts of limitations in due course.  I am unsure whether putting a floor on loan to value would be the way to get more lending and do not think that is a practical way to proceed.  As for the education of bankers, there are a lot of initiatives, albeit not on the part of the Central Bank, whereby the Institute of Bankers in Ireland, in co-operation with UCD and so on, is expanding the programme there.  While it is not something about which I know much, it obviously would have been very valuable had it been available previously.  The question of tenant rights and the buy-to-lets appears to be outside our purview.  While I acknowledge there are issues there, I do not think it can be used as a reason to halt and leave people who simply cannot afford them with buy-to-let properties.  One cannot state that because there might be a tenant issue, one cannot possibly proceed to clean up that situation, leave the borrower in a situation he or she can afford and move the process along.  It is not really for me to propose anything on the tenant situation, as that would be in a different sphere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013092500019#W00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1380123600,"counter":587,"content":"<p>On the issue of loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, now that this hopefully is being done much more sensibly than in the past, one could state in retrospect that by such rules, a loan was reckless.  One could state there is no point in pursuing a case to get &euro;340,000 out of a person who has an income of &euro;34,000 and that this was reckless as defined by the rules now in place.  While speed limits may not always have been there, in retrospect people who were driving around at twice the current speed limits were engaging in reckless behaviour even before we had such limits.  Consequently, one could use current sensible prudential rules and state that one judges AIB to have been daft in very many cases and while this will have to come in addition to the &euro;64 billion, we should get things moving on the other front.

It is with deep regret that we learned from the Kenyan Embassy that her only child, Mbugua Mwangi, and his fianc&eacute; were victims of the terrible terrorist plot at the shopping mall in Kenya.  It was a dreadful incident made even more so for those who know people affected by it.  The reason Catherine went back to Nairobi was to be near to her son.  Her son and his fianc&eacute; were due to get married and they were in the shopping mall buying wedding items when both of them were killed by the al-Qaeda network.  Our sympathies go to her and her family.

I will read the presentation and if there are questions afterwards my colleagues and I will be delighted to contribute to the discussion.<\/p><p>  We are deeply grateful for the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and for its members' genuine concern for the fate of the Baha'i community in Iran.  The expressions of support and assistance that have been forthcoming from our Government and Members of the Oireachtas, as well as from this esteemed committee and its members, are a great source of encouragement and pride for us as Irish Baha'is.<\/p><p>  We are gravely concerned about the situation faced by Baha'is in Iran and, indeed, for the many ordinary Iranians who are suffering discrimination or imprisonment on account of their religion or beliefs.  We would like to make the following observations which we hope will be of interest and assistance to the committee.<\/p><p>  As members of the committee will be aware, on 24 August 2013, Mr. Ataollah Rezvani, a 54-year old father of two, was murdered in his home town of Bandar Abbas in southern Iran.  I would like to tell you a little about Mr. Rezvani before proceeding.  He was born and grew up in Iran.  Shortly after the Islamic revolution of 1979, he began his studies for a degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Tehran.  However, during his second semester he was expelled because he was a Baha'i.  It was a struggle for Mr. Rezvani to make a career without qualifications.  Nevertheless, he managed to become an expert in water purification.  In 1985, he moved to Bandar Abbas to install water treatment systems for the cities of Bandar Abbas and Minab.<\/p><p>  Mr. Rezvani settled into a happy life with his family and was one of the city's small group of Baha'is who attended to the needs and problems of the community after the dissolution of the city's Baha'i administration in the 1980s.  He was respected and well-liked by colleagues, friends and neighbours, Baha'i and non-Baha'i, and had a reputation for kindness, integrity and service to his community.<\/p><p>  The Iranian authorities, who have exerted every effort to block the progress of Baha'is since 1979, reacted to Mr. Rezvani's success and popularity by issuing continuous threats against him.  Over the years, Mr. Rezvani and members of his family were harassed by agents of the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence who tried to force them to leave the city.  In addition, these were also years of hateful propaganda against Baha'is from the pulpit of local clerics in Bandar Abbas.  In recent times, due to pressure from the Ministry, Mr. Rezvani lost his job.  In parallel with this turn of events he also began to receive anonymous, menacing phone calls from persons unknown.<\/p><p>  On Saturday, 24 August, Ataollah Rezvani left his house in the evening but did not return home.  On the morning of Sunday, 25 August, exactly one month ago today, his car was found by a lorry driver in an isolated location on the outskirts of the city.  He had been shot in the back of the head.  All reports about this incident point to the fact that Ataollah Rezvani's abduction and murder was religiously motivated.  In spite of this, and in spite of the ongoing requests of his family and friends, there has been no official inquiry into his murder.<\/p><p>  All states have a duty under international law to investigate, prosecute and punish criminal behaviour.  In a context where there has been a history of discrimination, and particularly if the state authorities have had a role in this, such responsibilities are all the more pertinent.  Unfortunately, rather than investigate the crimes against their Baha'i citizens, the Iranian establishment has spearheaded the persecution and constantly sought to incite the masses against Baha'is.<\/p><p>  Speaking in Geneva last March, Heiner Bielefeldt, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, described this as &quot;one of the broadest and most obvious cases of state-sponsored religious persecution in the world&quot;.  As he put it, Iranian Baha'is experience persecution &quot;from the cradle to the grave, and beyond&quot;.<\/p><p>  Baha'is are not the only Iranians deprived of their rights.  There are many people from all walks of life in prison for their beliefs.  Though President Rouhani's election last June brought a promise of change, the evidence suggests otherwise.  For example, human rights organisations like Church in Chains are very concerned for a number of Iranian Christians now in prison, in particular four persons who are serving long prison sentences.  In July and August, they have reported that more than 20 Christians were arrested and detained.<\/p><p>  We understand from its Dublin Iran group,<i><\/i>that Amnesty International is gravely concerned for the well-being of four Sunni Muslim men from Iran's Kurdish minority, who are in imminent danger of being executed, perhaps within days.  In addition to this, Sufi activists continue to be imprisoned.  In late July, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, released a series of fatwas or religious rulings, one of which stated that Baha'is were &quot;deviant and misguided&quot; and should be shunned.  Shortly after these fatwas were published, Mr. Rezvani was murdered.<\/p><p>  Last week, 11 prisoners of conscience were released from prison in Iran and in the last few days - as the Chairman mentioned - there have been announcements of further releases.  This is, indeed, good news and the Baha'i community warmly welcomes this turn of events.  One of those released was the Sakharov prize-winning human rights lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh.  Interestingly, shortly before her release, Ms Sotoudeh wrote a letter to President Rouhani about the murder of Ataollah Rezvani.  The text of her letter describes accurately both the current situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> Mr. Rezvani's murder and the current danger for the 300,000 Baha'is living in Iran. <\/p><p>  With your permission, Chairman, I would like to quote part of Ms Sotoudeh's letter:<blockquote>Esteemed President, Mr. Rouhani,<br \/>The kidnapping and murder of a Baha'i fellow citizen during your tenure is reminiscent of previous murders of dissidents.  We expect you to root out these types of barbaric behaviours before they spiral out of control.  Many of us were familiar with the late Ataollah Rezvani and his esteemed relatives.  His sister was my fellow inmate in prison and I had the honour of acting as the lawyer for some of his relatives.  They are a family who had no desire other than service to the community; yet many members of that family have endured lengthy imprisonment or are still in prison.<br \/><br \/>  I hereby request you to put an end to the suppression of Baha'is and to condemn the statements that are used as permission for such violent actions against them.  I also request you to take necessary measures to vindicate the rights of the religious minorities and our Baha'i citizens in accordance with article 14 of the Islamic Republic's constitution, which binds the government and Muslims to treat non-Muslims humanely ... No peace loving Iranian would wish to cause discord or provoke public anger.  However, through legal means and change of the political discourse, the recognition of the rights of religious minorities is what the public demand.<br \/><br \/>  (signed) Nasrin Sotoudeh<\/blockquote>  The Iranian constitution, and the international covenants to which Iran is a signatory, provide for the just and transparent treatment of every citizen.  All that is required is for Iran to observe its own laws and fulfil undertakings already freely made.  Implementation of existing laws would mean a hate crime, like the religiously motivated murder of Ataollah Rezvani, would be investigated and those responsible brought to justice.<\/p> <p>We understand that there are many delicate diplomatic situations currently in train in the international political sphere.  However, as Nobel Laureate Shirin Ebadi points out, the international community must be careful not to allow Iran to sidestep human rights obligations in favour of making progress on other diplomatic fronts.  Iran must not be encouraged to interpret the possibility of agreement on some issues with the international community as permission to continue long-standing domestic abuses.<\/p><p> It is not only in the interest of the citizens of Iran, it is in the interests of everyone, everywhere, including Ireland, to encourage Iran to afford its own citizens all the rights to which they are entitled.  As Dwight Bashir, deputy director of policy and research at the US Commission on International Religious Freedom noted recently:<blockquote>Governments that limit the freedoms of their own people have shown no historical inclination to act peacefully toward other people.  On the other hand, democracies that respect the rights of their people rarely go to war with each other.<\/blockquote>Iran must be continually reminded that the international community is watching and that, ultimately, those who perpetrate abuses against Iranian citizens will be held accountable.<\/p><p> The persecution of Baha'is is one of the issues repeatedly denounced internationally when the UN, intergovernmental bodies and civil society comment on Iranian violations of international human rights standards.  For over 20 years, the UN General Assembly has adopted resolutions referring to violations against minorities in Iran including the Baha'is.  Since 2005, eight UN special procedures have reported on the abuses detailed above and they have also been presented in the reports on human rights in Iran by the UN Secretary General for the past four years.  These expert reports have emphasised that as religion and belief have the same status in the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, Iran must allow Baha'is to manifest their beliefs individually and in community with others, in public and in private.<\/p><p> How Iran's largest religious minority community is faring is arguably the best gauge of Iran's treatment of all its citizens.  It should be noted the Iranian Baha'is love their country deeply, despite the suffering they have endured.  They are heartened by growing support among the general population in defence of their rights and look forward to playing their part in the progress of that wonderful country.<\/p><p> We believe that the new Iranian President should be judged on his deeds rather than his words.  We ask the committee to join with us in calling on the Iranian President, Mr. Rouhani, to ensure freedom of religion and belief is respected and protected in Iran and that all the citizens of that country are treated with justice.  Since 2005, at least nine Baha'is have been murdered or died under suspicious circumstances.  We are not aware of a single instance of someone being prosecuted for these crimes, much less being convicted or imprisoned.  A full investigation into the murder of Mr. Ataollah Rezvani is, we believe, a requirement if we are to hope that talk of change is a prelude to actual improvement in the human rights situation in Iran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013092500003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McNamara","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380120000,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McNamara for his presentation.

In my opening statement I pointed to the murder of Mr. Ataollah Rezvani in Bandar Abbas.  There has not even been an investigation into the details surrounding his abduction and murder.  The fatwa released by the Iranian Supreme Leader which called for the shunning and marginalisation of Baha'is came at about the same time.<\/p><p>  It remains to be seen but we would hope there will be change.  However, the 112 Baha'is in prison in Iran have not yet been released.  The seven former leaders of the Baha'i community are five years into a 20-year sentence, the longest that any prisoner of conscience has received there.  In education, Baha'i students have again this year been denied access to university.  We do not see many changes yet.  It will take some time to see if this is actually a sea change.  Mr. Rouhani and his regime should be judged over a period.<\/p><p>  When Mohammad Khatami, a supposed moderate, was President of Iran from 1997 to 2005, there were many expressions for change just like we have heard over the past several months but nothing really did change.

Has the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community faced repression outside Iran and has the Iranian Government tried to influence other countries in how they treat members of the community?  Is the fact that the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community was historically based in Palestine but is now in Israel a factor in how it is treated?

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is well versed in the situation and has been very supportive.<\/p><p>  The opportunity to meet the committee is useful in that it shows the Iranian Government and the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community in Ireland and Iran that this Parliament is concerned about minority rights and those who are suffering persecution in Iran.  That is a positive and important statement for our Parliamentarians to make.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy asked whether the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; faith's connection with Israel was a factor.  The founder of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; faith was exiled from his native Iran to what was then Palestine under the Ottomans in the middle 1800s.  Consequently, the world centre for the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; faith has grown around his resting place.  That is the connection the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community developed since before the foundation of the state of Israel.  However, Iran is the land where the faith was born.  Bah&aacute;'&uacute;'ll&aacute;h, the founder of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;  faith, was Iranian and the majority of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community were located there at a particular time, but the faith has since spread to every part of the world.  In the early 1990s the Iranian Government made efforts to extend its persecution of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community by influencing other countries with which it was doing business to bring repressive measures to bear on their native populations.  A document that came to light at the human rights commission which was the precursor for the Human Rights Council outlined in detail a blueprint for repression against the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community.  One of the proposals involved the blocking of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community internationally.  In other words, Iran would use its influence in the way I have described.  However, I do not think its efforts in this regard have been particularly successful.  The Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community faces certain difficulties in other countries but not to the same extent as in Iran.  That has traditionally been the case in Muslim countries partly because the Bah&aacute;'&iacute;  faith dates from after Islam, which may help to answer the question of why it is singled out.  There is a teaching in Islam that nothing after it can happen.  Most Muslims take the same view as we do of live and let live when it comes to people with different beliefs, but, unfortunately, a small core of extreme Muslims who are now in control in places such as Iran believe they should do everything in their power to exterminate religious communities that have appeared since the birth of Islam.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013092500005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan McNamara"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380120600,"counter":635,"content":"<p>The Deputy's question on the trade delegation is difficult to answer.  It is similar to the nuclear issue in that several factors must be considered.  Sherin Ebadi has said on several occasions that we should be careful when we negotiate with Iran not to trade away human rights.  That is true on many issues.  In that sense, it would be useful to flag the issue because the best protection the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; community can receive is international attention.  Mr. Rezvani is now dead, but the fact that another 12 people currently in prison are alive, albeit badly treated, is due in no small part to international attention.  From our point of view, flagging the issue errs on the side of safety.<\/p><p>  In regard to Israel, the Iranian film maker Reza Allamehzadeh who is not Bah&aacute;'&iacute; made a documentary called \"Iranian Taboo\" which set out the perspective of a non-Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Iranian on the allegations against the faith.  He travelled to Israel to examine the subject and made a moving point on Bah&aacute;'&iacute; children in Iran who were accused of being Israeli spies.  One rural old lady featured in the documentary was accused of being a spy, even though she did not even know what Israel was.

I strongly agree with the points raised.  Iran has an opportunity to come out of darkness and into the light.  That is important both for the people of Iran and its administration.  I agree that there should be no trade-off on human rights.  In assessing a country's merits we should also consider how it deals with minorities.  I support the notion of writing a letter to the authorities, but an international element is also needed in that the United Nations and the EU High Commissioner should have access to prisons to see how prisoners are treated.  The people of Iran are very nice.  It has been many years since I visited the country, but it has a great heritage and tradition of hospitality.  It is a big country with a sizeable population.  It could play a beneficial role in international affairs, but that has not yet happened, to the detriment of the people of Iran, more than anybody else.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the points the delegates made and it is important we support what they said.  We cannot have a little regard for human rights; either we have regard for them or we do not.<\/p> <p>That is the opportunity the new regime has.  <\/p><p> I noticed that the President made a presentation at the United Nations recently.  I agree fully with the sentiments he expressed.  Having Iran in isolation is not good for peace in that region; therefore, we should be looking at encouraging it and its administration to come forward with proposals to address the issues of concern to the global community.  Without this, there will be no evolution.  The point made on the previous moderate regime was well made.  In ten or 20 years time we could find ourselves talking about the same issues such as prisoners who have been imprisoned for little or no reason and prisoners of conscience.  I emphasise the need to write to the United Nations and the European authorities in order to mobilise public opinion in this regard.  I also stress the importance from an Iranian perspective and the benefits for the Iranian people of ensuring they recognise and observe international norms on human rights.  One cannot have it both ways.  We cannot have prisoners of conscience where people who protest peacefully on the streets suddenly become prisoners for the rest of their lives for no reason.  I strongly support the points raised by the delegation.

It strikes me that its situation is very similar to that of the Falun Gong delegation from which we heard some time ago - they were mild-mannered, tolerant, peaceful and peace-loving people.  We also know that Christian groups are among the most persecuted in the world at this stage.  What mentality leads to this persecution?  Apart from the date issue mentioned by the delegation and the very tenuous connection with Israel, what has the Baha'i community in Iran done to cause the persecution of such a peaceful and tolerant people?  It is just incredible.<\/p><p>  I met the Iranian ambassador after one of the events and discussed the matter with him.  Unfortunately, I am still waiting on a reply, but if a letter is sent by this committee, it might add to my earlier request.  <\/p><p>  It seems the UN resolution is very ineffective and even Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are not making any progress on this issue.

It is more important for us to discuss it now in the light of the international movement and changes that seem to be occurring.  On behalf of the Government, one could say the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will never compromise on the issue of human rights which are one of the fundamental stools on which our foreign policy and relations are based.  Even as we develop trade links, a human rights element is always to the fore.<\/p><p>  I am happy to hold out the hand of friendship to the Iranians, but I am very cautious.  My understanding of the current President is that he is a religious person and that in Iran one can only stand for the presidency when one obtains the sanction of the religious authorities.  It is a strange structure.  It is not like a liberal democracy such as Ireland.  The supreme leader did not have the President as his chosen candidate, which begs the question as to how much freedom the President has.  It is very impressive for me to see that when the President went to the United States, he took a Jewish Member of Parliament along as his adviser.  Iran, Jews and Judaism do not seem to mix in the public's perception.  A very sophisticated seduction could be taking place, which is probably partly due to the effect of the sanctions which we understand are hurting.  I understand the delegation's fears that the nuclear issue will be the predominant one and that everybody will sit back and say they have achieved progress.  It is a little like the situation in Syria.  We do not hear much about President Assad at present, except that a deal is being done between the Americans and the Russians on weapons of mass destruction.  However, the other weapons of destruction are probably blasting away.  We fought for and lobbied ambassadors and foreign dignitaries extensively to gain our position on the UN Human Rights Council and are assured that the religious rights and freedoms of the Baha'is will be more adequately represented by our representative.  Is it the perception that Iran has a very sophisticated public relations exercise, given the political and religious structure in place and the ratification one must have even to stand for the presidency?  Hundreds of potential candidates were not even allowed to stand it.  The situation is evolving and the words coming out are very reassuring.  If we as a committee can further encourage them to move in a progressive direction, we will do so, even with the fear that it may be a con job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013092500006#E00300","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1380121200,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I join in welcoming the delegation which has made a very fair and balanced presentation.  From what it is telling us about the life and career of Mr. Rezvani, it appears that he did nothing but good for his country and community and helped to bring badly needed services to his area.  The persecution, Mr. Rezvani's murder and the imprisonment of many others are very disturbing.  However, there appears to be a window of opportunity and we need to grasp this opportunity.  The new President is making all the right noises, but as the delegation stated, he will be judged on his deeds.  As parliamentarians, we must take every opportunity to drive home the strength of our feeling about human rights abuses in Iran.<\/p><p>  Is there any real significance in the fact that the renowned human rights lawyer was released following her writing to the President?  She may play a very significant role in helping to get other prisoners released.  The committee should in the strongest possible way call for a full inquiry into the murder of Mr. Rezvani to have that issue resolved because there can be no confidence in the justice system if such an atrocious murder remains investigated and unpunished.  I know the committee will be very supportive of the case the delegation has made.  <\/p><p>  I saw in the document the delegation sent to us that the President had promised a new civil rights charter and to ensure equality for all Iranian citizens.

As the Senator outlined, public opinion on the ground in Iran has changed considerably.  The majority of Iranians citizens are very supportive of the Baha'is and the difficulties come from the regime authorities.  Many Iranian citizens are neighbours of Baha'is and see them as they are, namely, people who want to contribute to their country rather than destroy it, as the authorities would have it.  Public opinion has become more positive so it is time to put on considerable pressure.  The fact that the special rapporteur has not yet been allowed into Iran is another difficulty.  If that were allowed to happen it would be another signal of change.  We very much appreciate the role this committee and our Government along with the other European governments have played.

The question was asked as to what the Baha'is have ever done.  It dates back to the foundation of the Baha'i faith and is based on those religious grounds I mentioned.  Over the years it became very convenient to have a bogeyman, a minority community, an other, whenever things were going wrong.  In a country where the media was very tightly controlled, Government propaganda against Baha'is went unanswered because there was no access.  Even ordinary people thought that perhaps there must be something strange, but that has changed, thankfully, because much more information is available.  People know the people with whom they live, they know the people around them and there is a considerable number of Baha'is in Iran.<\/p><p>  Iran is a terrific country with a marvellous culture and one would want to see it play its full part in the community of nations.  Baha'is absolutely adore their country.  They are proud of their culture and we are in no way against Iran or Islam.  This is trying to see, on the human rights principle, how we can find, not necessarily a favoured position for the Baha'i community, but just an equal setting so that Baha'is, like everybody else in Iran, can play their part in the progress of the country and, therefore, in the progress of the international community.<\/p><p>  The question as to whether this is a real change or not is very interesting, because we hope it is and that these releases will be followed by a charter and more real change.  The Baha'i community could provide a litmus test to gauge whether those changes are real.  Earlier I mentioned I was reading how the rapporteur, Professor Bielefeldt, said the Baha'is are persecuted from the cradle to the grave and beyond.  People might not understand that but it is a reference to the fact that Baha'i cemeteries have been destroyed and confiscated, so as a Baha'i one is not necessarily that safe even after one is dead.<\/p><p>  If we see things really happening with respect to the Baha'i community, people allowed to have their own resting places unimpeded, be educated, go to university and hold jobs, that will be a signal that President Rouhani's words are coming to fruition.  We hope for that.  We hope for a day when the Baha'i community is emancipated, as well as the other minorities.  Deputy Maureen Sullivan mentioned that Christians are suffering.

If I speak for too long, I ask members not to hesitate to interrupt.<\/p><p>  The topic the joint committee kindly invited me to address is the proposed United Kingdom justice and home affairs block opt-out, including any possible implications for Ireland.  I presume members have copies of the speaking note I prepared.  I considered the best approach to the briefing would be to list a number of questions on the proposed opt-out for discussion.<\/p><p>  I will address the following questions together.  Why does the United Kingdom have a protocol 36 opt-out?  How does this differ from the Irish protocol 21 opt-out, with an opt-in?  Why did Ireland not negotiate an outcome that reflected the position of Britain in this regard?  The story of the UK opt-out begins with the considerable advances in justice and home affairs co-operation which were made with the treaty of Lisbon in 2007 and its subsequent entry into force in December 2009.  The Lisbon treaty effectively resulted in the abolition of the intergovernmental third pillar of the European Union governing police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters and a switch to the more normal, so-called Community method of decision making.  In plain language, this meant a more exclusive role for the Commission in proposing and enforcing legislation and a broadened and more normal form of jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice.<\/p><p>  Changes of this nature are by and large welcome for Ireland.  Commission proposals mean that the interests of the European Union as a whole are taken into account, rather than only those of large member states.  Moreover, legislation is better enforced and a role for the European Court of Justice by and large means the application of European Union law becomes more uniform.  To sweeten the pill, protocol 36 provided for a five year transition period during which the European Court of Justice and Commission enjoyed only their old powers in respect of pre-2009 measures.  In the UK, with its deeply ingrained history of euroscepticism, the changes rang alarm bells and, as a result, two protocols were negotiated, one forward-looking, the other backward-looking. <\/p><p>  Members should be reasonably familiar with the forward-looking protocol 21, which involved the famous opt-out, with an opt-in, in respect of justice and home affairs measures.  According to this protocol, the United Kingdom would not take part in the adoption of justice and home affairs measures proposed after the Lisbon treaty and such measures would not be binding on the UK.  The opt-in aspect of the protocol is two-pronged.  In the first instance, the UK could notify within three months of a measure being proposed that it wanted to take part in the adoption and application of any such proposed measure and would be entitled to do so.  The second limb of the opt-in was that even if the UK did not give such notification, it could, at any time after the adoption of a justice and home affairs measure, notify that it wished to accept the measure and it would be allowed to do so.  The forward-looking protocol 21 was, therefore, a permanent opt-out, with a double opt-in possibility.<\/p><p>  What was Ireland's position on protocol 21?  Confronted with the prospective absence of the largest common law country in the European Union from an indefinite number of justice and home affairs measures and thus the possibility of being in a very weak negotiating position, Ireland, despite not having any real reservations either about the Commission or European Court of Justice, also negotiated and secured essentially the same deal.  Ireland's opt-out is little different from that of Britain's, although it is slightly more limited as it does not apply, for instance, to anti-terrorist measures to freeze funding.  It is also more easily escapable in that all we must do is notify in writing that we no longer want to be covered and that is the end of the matter.  We declared an intention at Lisbon to review the operation of our adherence to protocol 21.  Our declared attitude is also different from that of Britain because we declared at Lisbon an intention to opt into everything possible.  None the less, our overall position in respect of measures proposed and adopted subsequent to the Lisbon treaty is similar to that of the United Kingdom in that we have an opt-out and two opt-ins.  I do not need to remind members that there are also constitutional provisions relating to this in the form of Article 29.4.7&deg; and 8&deg;.<\/p><p>  The forward-looking protocol 21 did not fully address the UK's concerns at Lisbon because Britain also looked back at more than 130 measures in justice and home affairs co-operation that had been agreed in the period between the Maastricht treaty of 1993 and 2009.  The UK argued that these measures had been adopted at a time when the involvement of the Commission and European Court of Justice had not been envisaged.  At this point, the UK sought to review the issue of whether it was still interested in continuing to adhere to these measures given the changed role for the Commission and European Court of Justice.  The other member states - rather reluctantly, I suspect - allowed the UK to opt out of all 130 measures <i>en bloc<\/i> and subsequently selectively opt in again.<\/p> <p>Protocol 36 gives expression to that particular deal.  Therefore, at the latest, six months before the expiration of the Lisbon transitional period, the United Kingdom could make a notification.  The effect of that notification would be that all 130-odd measures would cease to apply to it.  The United Kingdom could then at any time afterwards notify the Council of its wish to participate in the measures - in other words, to opt back in - but subject to certain procedural requirements.<\/p><p> Let us recall the basic difference between the Protocol 21 opt-out and the Protocol 36 opt-out.  The Protocol 21 opt-out is an open-ended forward-looking opt-out applying to all JHA matters proposed and adopted from 1 December 2009 onwards - basically, forever - with guaranteed ease of opt-in should we want it.  The Protocol 36 opt-out, which is the one we are talking about today and which only the United Kingdom has, applies backwards to a finite number of measures, approximately 130, adopted before 2009 in the field of police and judicial co-operation in the criminal law field, all of which must be opted out of <i>en bloc<\/i>, with the United Kingdom joining some of them, but only under certain procedural conditions.  I may return to these later.  That is the difference between Protocols 36 and 21.<\/p><p> With regard to why Ireland did not negotiate a Protocol 36 opt-out, we had no need to.  We opted in to the Protocol 21 opt-out only to protect ourselves from a situation in which there might be an absence of a heavyweight negotiating partner in there with us on Justice and Home Affairs proposals; it was no more than that.  We have no issue with the Commission or with the Court of Justice, or with their being given an expanded role.  Therefore, we had no need whatsoever for a Protocol-36-type arrangement.  The measures adopted prior to 2009 had been adopted with the United Kingdom sitting around the table with everyone else.  Therefore, Ireland's perceived need for a heavyweight negotiating partner had been met with regard to those particular measures.<\/p><p> The next question relates to why the United Kingdom is exercising this opt-out now.  There is no obligation whatsoever for the United Kingdom to exercise its Protocol 36 right to opt-out of these 130 measures.  Protocol 36 gives the United Kingdom a right, but it does not impose an obligation on it.  Second, the decision to exercise the opt-out appears to have been made for domestic political reasons, not for any real practical reasons.  To be frank, it is because of pressure emanating from the Conservative Party backbenches with regard to these measures, objections to an increased role for the Commission and the Court of Justice and ironically, given that they are now going to propose opting back into it, particular objections to the European arrest warrant framework decision.  Apparently, the Liberal Democrats made it pretty much a red-line issue that it wanted to see an opt-in to that.<\/p><p> With regard to the timing of the opt-out, the five-year transition period provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon expires on 30 November 2014.  At that point, the Commission and the Court of Justice get their extra powers under the Lisbon treaty. The protocol requires notification by the United Kingdom to opt in, at the latest, six months before that, 31 May 2014.  That is the deadline.  Obviously, if the United Kingdom intends to opt back into many measures, that must be negotiated with the Commission and the other member states, leaving sufficient time.  Any parliamentary approval required must also be obtained.  This seems to be the reason the United Kingdom is acting now.<\/p><p> Why has so much concern been expressed about the exercise of the opt-out?  The simple answer to that is that the framework of much co-operation that goes on in the field of Justice and Home Affairs is now European and because the United Kingdom is a large state within the European Union, much concern has been raised by the prospect of its opting out of any of that co-operation.  Those concerns are far from being expressed outside the United Kingdom alone.  The House of Lords produced a report in April this year which stated that the Government had not made a convincing case for exercising the opt-out and that opting out would have significant adverse negative repercussions for the internal security of the United Kingdom and the administration of criminal justice there, as well as reducing its influence over this area of EU policies.  Therefore, this is deeply controversial not just outside the United Kingdom, but inside the United Kingdom also.  That conclusion was reached prior to the declaration of the measures the United Kingdom would opt back into, but nonetheless it gives some indication of the concerns.<\/p><p> On whether Ireland has reason to be particularly concerned in this regard, yes it has.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was so concerned about this that he spoke out in public on the matter and was quoted in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>and the <i>Financial Times<\/i>, in an attempt, I think, to discourage the United Kingdom from exercising this option.  He cited in particular security worries associated with the situation in Northern Ireland.  The relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland in the field of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters is based on a complex matrix, a kind of Gordian knot of rules.  Some of them are domestic, some are European and some are domestic rules implementing European rules.  It is a complex situation and the effect of the United Kingdom jettisoning co-operation under a total of 130-plus EU measures in this field, without opting back into any of them, would have serious consequences for the ongoing co-operation between the United Kingdom and Ireland in this area.  Therefore, we have a right to be concerned about this.<\/p><p> Three factors come into play here.  One concerns what the United Kingdom will opt back into.  Since 9 July, we know what it intends to opt back into.  We do not know it will be able to do so, but we know what it intends to opt back into.  The second factor is how long the United Kingdom will remain outside the protocol.  There will be a gap, but how long will that gap be?  Will it be one second or a couple of months?  This is important to Ireland.  The third factor concerns how much notice we are given.  We are getting a year's notice, at least in regard to what it intends to opt back into.<\/p><p> It is important to point out that we should not exaggerate the implications.  Much of the co-operation that goes on between Ireland and the United Kingdom is executive-to-executive co-operation.  That will not be jeopardised by the Protocol 36 opt-out.  Second, even in so far as co-operation based on legal measures is concerned, this is a finite list of measures.  Protocol 36 has no application to any measures adopted or amended after 1 December 2009.  Third, not all of the measures are particularly significant.  Fourth, the United Kingdom will try to opt back into and re-participate in the measures that are most significant to Ireland.<\/p><p> That said, some of the measures in the opt-out are hugely significant.  The two I would put at the top of the heap in that regard are the European arrest warrant and the Europol measure.  The UK's re-entry cannot be guaranteed.  Therefore, we must be ready for problems in this regard.  More specifically, there is a need for three things.  There is a need for a plan B in case negotiations in respect of any of the 35 opt-ins do not go according to plan.  If the United Kingdom gets into some but not all of them, we must be ready for that.  Above all, we need to be concerned about the European arrest warrant, because we do not want extradition co-operation between Ireland and the United Kingdom breaking down.  The vast bulk of persons surrendered to Ireland by other EU member states under the European arrest warrant system are surrendered by the United Kingdom - over 80% of them.  This is a serious issue as far as Ireland is concerned.<\/p><p> With regard to what we should do if negotiations break down, we need to be ready with alternative bilateral arrangements, renewed statutory provisions based on the 1957 European Convention on Extradition or a new agreement at European level.  We must have something ready and have a plan B.  We also need to mind the gap.  No matter what happens, even if we get a complete opt-in, there will be a time lapse between the United Kingdom's opting out and its opting back on.  We need to be prepared for that.  We also need to think about the implications of those measures the United Kingdom is not going to opt into - approximately 100 measures.  These are not the most significant measures in regard to Ireland.  Many of them have to do with administrative co-operation, in which it does not matter that much whether the United Kingdom is present.  However, we must do a comprehensive survey of those instruments and be ready for UK absence from them.<\/p><p> With regard to how Ireland would like to see the United Kingdom exercise its opt-out, I am tempted to say that Ireland would have preferred the United Kingdom not to exercise its opt-out at all, on the grounds that there is no objective, practical need for this as police and judicial co-operation in the criminal field is working fine and there are many disadvantages to its opting out.  However, there are some things we do not get to choose in life.  On 9 July, Theresa May, the UK Home Secretary, announced the UK Government's intention to opt out of 130 measures and to opt back into 35 of them.<\/p><p> On whether there are particular measures Ireland is particularly interested in seeing the United Kingdom opt back into, the answer is &quot;Yes.&quot;  Broadly speaking, the areas we are concerned about are the European arrest warrant; arrangement of mutual assistance measures; Europol; some drugs and organised crime measures; measures concerned with information exchange; and measures concerned with databases of criminal records and false documents.  I am happy to be able to say that going by Theresa May's statement on 9 July and the associated command paper 8671, which is worth looking at, the United Kingdom is going to try to negotiate its way back into measures in all of these fields.  From an Irish point of view, if the United Kingdom succeeds in doing that, a great deal of the damage that might otherwise have been done will be avoided.<\/p><p> What specifically is the United Kingdom opting back into?<\/p> <p>The European arrest warrant is number one.  Above and beyond anything else on the list, that is what we want to see them successfully rejoin as quickly as possible, because the whole framework of extradition of co-operation is based on that.  The earlier legislation on this has been repealed; it is just not there anymore.  Therefore, if the European arrest warrant system is gone, we do not have anything to fall back on at the moment.  Will there be any potential problems in the UK getting back into the European arrest warrant?  Perhaps there might be, because the British Parliament is in the course of adopting the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill 2013, in which it is unilaterally introducing a number of restrictions on the operation of European arrest warrants.  It may well be that those restrictions are in accordance with EU law, but if not, how will the Commission react?  Does it risk a breakdown in the negotiations?  We will have to see.  I am cautiously optimistic about the UK getting back in, for the simple reason that the UK is a big prize to have in the European arrest warrant system and I think the Commission will want them back in.  However, I am only cautiously optimistic.<\/p><p> The UK is only opting back into Europol as long as that organisation is not given the power to direct national law enforcement agencies to initiate investigations or share data conflicting with the UK's national security.  That is a big restriction on any agreement to go back into Europol.  On the other hand, Europol is the crown jewel of police and judicial co-operation in the criminal law field, so having the UK outside of it is almost unthinkable.  The Commission has a big decision to make on this.  Does it want to proceed with developing Europol the way it wants to see it develop, or does it want the UK in?  It looks as if it will not get both, so we will have to wait and see what happens.  The UK is opting back into the other measures that I mentioned, such as mutual assistance for drugs and organised crime, so we can be reasonably happy with that situation.<\/p><p> The procedural requirements are important.  The Schengen Agreement is the border busting treaty at European level, and we are not party to it.  If the UK were to opt back in to the Schengen Agreement, that would require unanimous agreement by all of the other member states, which they can refuse for any reasons they wish, so it will be tougher for the UK to get back into Schengen measures.  As we are not in the agreement, we do not need to worry about that.  The non-Schengen measures just need Commission approval to go back and I think the UK can rely on the goodwill of the Commission for that.  They need to worry about the Commission for things like the European arrest warrant, Europol and so on.<\/p><p> The final point is about whether there is any danger in the UK not being allowed to re-enter any of the measures.  We have to bear in mind the procedural questions that I just mentioned.  I think we can rely on the goodwill of the Commission in this regard, but there is no room for complacency because much can go wrong between now and the end of 2014.  The Commission will change at the end of 2014 and I do not know how long it will take the new Commission to adjust to its new role and what the attitude of the new members of the Commission will be.  There will also be European Parliament elections as well, although that is less of an issue.  Greece will have the Presidency of the Council in the beginning of 2013, and the role of the Presidency will be crucial in shepherding along the negotiations between the UK, the other member states and the Commission.   We can hardly blame Greece if its attention is elsewhere during this time, so we have to see how things work out and we need to be ready for any eventuality.  I apologise for being far longer than five minutes, but hopefully that will provide committee members with some idea of what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500003#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380099000,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

As always, his analysis is very much valued here.  In his reasons for these events, he listed the rise of UKIP and the concern of Conservative Party backbenchers about the dominance of Europe.  We all agree that we need European and international co-operation to tackle human trafficking and drugs trafficking, and the use of the Internet to promote criminality.  Clearly we need that level of co-operation between our police forces.  One of the issues that comes up is that not every member state has the same data protection measures, so we are trying to balance the need for civil liberties versus the need for co-operation and security to tackle real threats to all of our people.  Are there any valid concerns about that balance expressed by Conservative Party backbenchers, or is it more a symbolic expression of independence from Europe that means they wish to have control over their national security apparatus?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500005#E00300","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380099000,"counter":671,"content":"<p>That is a very legitimate question.  I would say \"Yes\".  Historically, much of the co-operation that has taken place at justice and home affairs level, and police and judicial co-operation at European level has been driven by the various executives.  That is less the case now, because we have a more community-based system, even though the European Community is not there anymore.  There is more involvement of the European Parliament and the other institutions.  Previously, these issues were very much dominated by the Council.  National governments tend to have their own priorities.  The Schengen Agreement was always a kind of a balance.  On the one hand, it liberated matters as border controls were removed, but on the other hand, in order to compensate for the removal of border controls, we got increased judicial and police co-operation.  Ireland and the UK proposed to opt into the repressive measures, but not into the border busting measures.  It is something I have always been a little bit uncomfortable about, because the two measures were meant to march in lock-step with one another.  For the time being, that does not arise anyway, because we just do not have the financial means to set up the likes of the Schengen information system, which is a computerised database.<\/p><p>  I think that it is important that we opt in to measures other than repressive measures.  We also have measures under judicial co-operation that guarantee rights of individuals, such as victims' rights, the rights of accused persons and so on.  That balance has not always been the correct one in the past, but proposals are being made on measures for victims' rights, bail and so on, and it is important that we in Ireland consider very carefully the need to opt into not just the repressive measures, but also the measures that guarantee rights.<\/p><p>  There have been valid concerns on the part of Conservative Party backbenchers.  The European arrest warrant is not a perfect instrument.  The biggest problem with the arrest warrant concerns proportionality.  I mentioned that the largest number of surrenders by another state in the European Union comes from the United Kingdom.  I did not mention the largest number of surrenders to another state by Ireland, because that is not the UK, but to Poland.  That is the case in virtually every state in the EU and this is because the Poles require the surrender of persons in respect of offences which can be absolutely trivial.  These are tiny offences which do not even justify the cost of sending persons back to Poland.  Why exactly that is the case is a matter of Polish law and practice, but it has led to some fairly ridiculous situations materialising and that is a concern.  The UK is trying to deal with proportionality in its legislation.  I would be interested to see how acceptable it is to the European Commission in writing the proportionality rule into UK legislation.  Proportionality is a principle of European Union law, so I think there should be some rule for its application, but we will have to wait and see on that.<\/p><p>  The other concern in the UK has been in respect of persons who are being surrendered and detained for a long pretrial period in another country, but when the trial comes up, it is decided there is no case to answer and the person is returned home.  In principle, that is alright but the person has a couple of months of his life in a prison in a foreign country.  That is a matter of concern as well, and these concerns are legitimate.  I note from Theresa May's talk that what she proposed to do was to take advantage of the proposed legislation at European level, whereby it will not be normal to imprison people like that anymore and they will have a right to be released.  It is interesting that she sees the solution as being at a European level.<\/p><p>  I would not say that the concerns of the Conservative Party backbenchers are entirely without foundation, but there tends sometimes to be an exaggerated focus on the problems and not sufficient acknowledgement of the advantages.  An example would be the attempted bombing of the Shepherd's Bush tube station.<\/p> <p>One of the perpetrators fled to Rome immediately afterwards and was surrendered back to the United Kingdom within a matter of weeks.  This would not have happened without the European arrest warrant.  I refer also to a very prominent case some time ago, which we all remember, of an individual who fled to France with a minor.  That individual was returned to the United Kingdom by virtue of an arrest warrant.  I agree that, as with any measures, there are concerns and I share some of those concerns.  However, whether those concerns justify turning one's back on the entire European arrest warrant system is a different matter.  I am not sure if it was politics or common sense that prevailed in the UK.  I suspect it was politics but we have reason to be grateful for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500005#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380099600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Barrett for a really comprehensive overview which is very helpful to the committee.  Following from Deputy Mac Lochlainn's question, I am interested in the consequence for Ireland of the UK position, which whatever the motivation, clearly is the necessity to have ready a plan B in the shape of bilateral agreements with the UK if that country does not decide to opt back in to measures such as the European arrest warrant.<\/p><p>  I refer to the effect on the development of justice and home affairs, JHA, measures generally.  Dr. Barrett highlighted that there may be a slowing down of development or expansion of Europol's powers.  I can see the advantages and disadvantages to this.  There was a strong view in Irish criminal justice circles for a long time that opting in generally to JHA measures was going to water down protections for the accused in Irish law and, much as some of the Tory back bench concerns were valid, those were very valid concerns.  I agree with Dr. Barrett that at EU level there has been in more recent years a better focus on rights, not only of accused persons but also of victims.  Initially at least, it did appear that we would be diluting our constitutional protections and due process by opting in to everything.  I am interested in this idea of the slowing down of development of JHA.  Does Dr. Barrett regard this as a real issue not just in terms of Europol?  For example, a motion is to be before the House on the European public prosecutor's office.  Will this measure be affected by virtue of the UK opt-out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500006#F00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380099600,"counter":674,"content":"<p>On the consequences of the UK position if it does not get back in, I agree it is possible there might be bilateral agreements between the UK and Ireland.  There is also a question of European law and whether it is appropriate to replace measures like that at European or at Irish level, in other words, a bilateral agreement between the other member states or between the European Union as a whole and the UK rather than just bilateral measures between Ireland and the UK.  Replacing the European arrest warrant will create some major difficulties for Ireland in some respects.  I do not think it is advisable that we go back to the previous position either because it was less certain in its result and very cumbersome and lengthy.  A bilateral arrangement will be far more open to constitutional challenge in that Article 29.4 will not apply whereas it does apply to the framework decision.  There is far more room for the decision to become more cumbersome, more difficult, more awkward and less certain in its result if it is replaced, even if it is possible to replace it with bilateral arrangements.  Yet, we may have to do that if negotiations do not go as planned.  I am hopeful that it will not come to this and the British Government does not seem to intend that it will, but we will have to see how the negotiations work out.<\/p><p>  On the question of concerns about human rights, things have worked out a bit better than they seem but I agree with those concerns.  I was concerned that in the European arrest warrant framework decision there is no explicit provision on human rights.  It is provided for in the preamble in that it is mentioned, but that is as far as it goes.  This is typical of co-operation as it started off because it was a co-operation between executives, and executives and departments of justice all over Europe have their own priorities.  We are seeing much more of a balance at this stage between rights and repression.  There is a need to have repressive measures but there is also a need to have measures to provide rights.  It is very important to achieve a balance between the two.  That is why I am happier to see all this area opened up and dealt with on a <i>communautaire <\/i>basis and with appropriate judicial control.  However, there is one restriction relating to judicial control which relates to enforcement measures and the police.  The European Court of Justice does not have rule in this regard.<\/p><p>  On the question of a slowing down of development in justice and home affairs, Europe is consensus-driven.  There is qualified majority voting in many measures at European Union level.  This is not so much the case in the area of JHA but it exists to a certain level.  Even where there is consensus or where there is provision for qualified majority voting, there is always the feeling that it is better not to outvote the other member states because if one state outvotes the others, they, in turn, will outvote that state the next day.  There is always a drive for consensus at European level.  The United Kingdom pulling back on measures will act as a retarding influence on the European Union because the other member states will want to see the United Kingdom with them.  Ireland would have reason to be concerned about the United Kingdom not participating as fully as possible, and not even participating as fully as possible as it does now, with regard to policing and judicial co-operation in the criminal law field.  At the moment, we have an opt-out with an opt-in with regard to ongoing measures.  Both the UK and Ireland are opting in to a great deal of measures.  By and large, they do not opt-in to certain measures that they would perceive as not being compatible with justice co-operation.  I understand we are not proposing to opt-in to the European investigation order, but by and large we opt-in.  Europe in general and Ireland in particular would have reason to be concerned if the United Kingdom changed that attitude.  We are not just talking about protocol 36 but also protocol 21.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gavin Barrett"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099600,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Barrett to the meeting.  Dr. Barrett referred to domestic political reasons for the UK exercising the opt-out clause.  He also referred to the issue of the eurosceptics.  Any of us who have valid concerns and who want to ask questions are often dismissed as eurosceptics.  I regard myself as very pro-Europe but I also have concerns and views on issues and I have the democratic right to ask questions about the direction being taken by Europe.  However, people like me are often dumped into one corner, as it were, by certain others.<\/p><p>  Dr. Barrett spoke about the balance between the rights of victims and issues of human rights.  In my view, at a European level, certain victims are not included sufficiently and there is always a political aspect.  Dr. Barrett referred to one of the people involved in the London bombings who was extradited from Italy within weeks.  However, I would make a counter-argument.  An Oireachtas motion looked for co-operation on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  We asked the British Government for co-operation but we received none.  Some victims are more equal than others.  It is important to have a balance and that every victim and every citizen of Europe is treated with equality and respect.<\/p><p>  I refer to the point about extradition arrangements with Poland.  It seems that the reasons for extradition to Poland are very petty.  The Polish Government pays for the extradition so there is no cost to the Irish taxpayer.  For example, a person wanted for non-payment of a fine in Poland and is living in Ireland is extradited for that offence.  I do not agree with the Polish law but that is their right.

However, many of the concerns expressed in respect of that decision were actually somewhat exaggerated.  I am of the view that such concerns were ideological in nature.  In other words, there was a tendency to look at everything bad about the framework decision without considering the positive side.  I can do no better than refer to the report of the relevant select committee of the House of Lords in that regard.  I actually appeared before that committee before it made its decision, although I am not sure I had too much to do with the conclusion it reached.  The committee in question stated at the time that the UK Government had not made a convincing case for exercising the opt-out and that its approach would have negative repercussions for internal security, the administration of criminal justice and the UK's influence in Europe.  The Lords select committee was quite damning with regard to the prospect of the use of the Protocol 36 opt-out.  That raises a question as to why the United Kingdom has been choosing to exercise this opt-out.  I do not see the practical reasons for doing it.  I am of the view that the UK authorities approach is being driven by ideological rather than practical reasons.  Judging by its report, the House of Lords select committee shares that view.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that rights such as those relating to equality and respect are imperative.  These rights need to be respected.  One of the things about the European arrest warrant is that it is an almost quasi-automatic procedure.  If, therefore, Ireland sought the extradition or surrender of somebody who was suspected of being involved in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, there is a procedure available under the arrest warrant.  Previously, it would have been a great deal more difficult in that regard and it would have been possible to introduce many challenges to a request that an individual be surrendered.  I do not really want to discuss that matter because I am not aware of any particular individuals who might be subject to European arrest warrants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500006#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gavin Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380100200,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I was a member of the former Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights Sub-Committee on the Barron Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500007#G00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380100200,"counter":681,"content":"<p>I see.

We are very glad to have this opportunity to discuss our proposed fourth programme and to outline why we have made these particular recommendations.<\/p><p>  As the committee is aware, the commission was established with the remit, among other things, &#8220;to keep the law under review and undertake examinations and conduct research with a view to reforming the law&#8221;.  The commission must &#8220;formulate proposals for reforming the law&#8221;.  The committee is probably aware that we are now at an advanced stage in the completion of our third programme of law reform which comprised 37 separate projects, which is a very large number of projects.  It was approved by the Government in 2008 and was to be completed by the end of 2014.  Nine of the original 37 projects have been overtaken by events, by which we mean there has been an investigation of the topic by some other group or some matters may have been resolved by the enactment of legislation.  At present we expect to have completed all of the projects, other than those which have been overtaken by events, by the end of this year.  We have also undertaken three projects as a result of requests which are references from the Attorney General under the terms of section 4(2)(<i>c<\/i>) of the Act.<\/p> <p>Incidentally, the three projects that were referred to us concerned the civil liability of good samaritans and volunteers, mandatory sentences and the report on intercountry adoptions and we have reported on all three.  I should indicate this particular commission was only appointed last year and is less than 12 months old.  In the course of the past 12 months, we have completed and published a final report on missing persons at which the Chairman was present and he kindly presided at that launch.  In addition, we have published and launched another report on the law relating to juries, as well as our report on mandatory sentences earlier this year.  Moreover, we expect to publish final reports on the remaining third programme projects before the end of this year.  They will concern warrants, that is, bench warrants and search warrants, evidence, which will include separate details on hearsay, expert and documentary evidence, sexual offences and capacity to consent and insurance contracts.  These will comprise a further four reports that we intend to launch and publish this year.<\/p><p> As I stated, the commission in its entirety was only appointed less than 12 months ago and we have been appointed for a term of three years from mid-2012.  We therefore decided to recommend to the joint committee and to the Government a short and focused fourth programme that we hope will be capable of completion within the remaining two years of our term of office - as we have only two years left.  While this may be somewhat ambitious, I will come to that, one reason we are recommending 11 projects is because at present, in any event, we see the commission with only two years remaining in its term of office.  Consequently, we intend to change things slightly and have a short and focused programme.  I acknowledge that 11 projects in a two-year or even in a three-year period is a substantial task and it may not be possible to complete it in that time.  However, that is the reason we are recommending 11 projects.  We want to do it, we want to do it properly and we want to do it in a focused manner.<\/p><p> Our recommendations result from consideration of submissions and ideas received during a wide-ranging consultation process.  In fact, it includes proposals from the commissioners themselves as well.  In October 2012, we sent letters to Departments, NGOs, other public interest groups and the public at large, inviting them to make suggestions for the reform of the law.  That was the commencement of our project for the preparation of our proposed fourth programme.  We held a number of public consultations designed to provide the widest possible opportunity for all interested parties to engage in the law reform process and to suggest areas of law they thought required to be reformed and we received a very large number of suggestions.  We had more than 200 written submissions and suggestions although many of them overlapped, which is to say the same or a similar, almost identical, project was suggested by another party.  When we whittled that down, as it were, we found ourselves with 69 viable projects we thought really deserved careful consideration.  We then had our first public consultation and we devoted our annual conference in Dublin last December to that.  That particular conference focused on the fourth programme with particular reference to the then and current economic and fiscal crisis, codification of our laws and the commission's role in criminal law, civil law and laws relating to ethical, moral and philosophical matters.  We invited a number of eminent and helpful speakers to address the conference and invited anyone to participate who would do so, including all the interested parties who had shown an interest.  We had other consultations and in particular, we had a public consultation in NUI Galway in February 2013.  We met representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality in December 2012 and met representatives of the Irish Criminal Bar Association in March 2013.  We then engaged in a process of reducing our 69 proposals to the type of programme we felt we could complete.  We did this with a shortlisting measure, that is, through various shortlists that we repeatedly reduced until eventually, we identified 11 areas of law as being particularly in need of consideration.  We submitted these proposed projects to the Attorney General earlier this year and are now placing them before the joint committee for its consideration.<\/p><p> Like every other institution of whatever kind within the State at present, the commission must now operate with greatly reduced financial and human resources and our budget has been reduced by approximately 35%.  We understand that fully and are managing that.  We have given careful thought to this fact and in light of that, it is our intention to keep our various projects and our methodology under constant review in order that neither the commission's productivity nor the quality of its work will suffer.  Our traditional approach has been to publish, in respect of each project, a consultation paper that invites submissions upon the provisional recommendations that are contained within that consultation paper.  It usually takes approximately one year to publish this and under this traditional method, we can ask for submissions based on those provisional recommendations.  That then is followed by a report with final recommendations and as I stated, usually there is at least a year between the publication of the consultation paper and the final report.<\/p><p> At present, we are developing working methods to ensure that each project is dealt with discretely in a way that is appropriate to that individual project.  Some projects may be more amenable to the earlier production of discrete issue papers.  I mean by this that after an investigation, we can discover there are particular issues relating to a particular topic that are becoming highly significant, are attracting significant attention and need to be addressed.  We already have started to publish issue papers and to send such papers to interested parties and to make them available to the public on our website.  This indicates that these are issues within this particular project that are attracting attention and which we are considering carefully and are matters on which we would like to have the views of the interested parties and members of the public.<\/p><p> This is a change, to some extent, in our methodology, which will fit into some particular projects because some projects hopefully will be bigger than others and some may be relatively discrete.  Moreover, we intend to send out, as we have done successfully in the past, issue papers and to ask for comments, observations on submissions.  This is a change in our methodology and we intend to continue to look at methods and ways in which we can change.  In respect of the aforementioned issue papers, I should indicate that we already have published two such issue papers in two of the third programme projects already.  One was on the law of evidence, the other was on domestic violence and the results in that regard were encouraging.  Consequently, we intend to adopt a highly flexible approach to the presentation of projects included in the fourth programme in order that the format of each project can be individually tailored to the subject matter of the project.<\/p><p> The word \"reform\" of the law, for the purposes of the commission's function, is defined in section 1 of our establishing Act as including \"its codification (including in particular its simplification and modernisation) and the revision and consolidation of statute law\".  It is true to state that comparatively ready access to our law reform is part of what I believe is described therein as \"simplification and modernisation\".  For that reason, and as part of its general statutory mandate to keep the law under review, the commission presently maintains three ongoing and highly important accessibility projects as part of its core activity.  These projects are first, a legislation directory, which is a searchable guide to amendments made to Acts and a publicly-available database, which is available online and is maintained on an ongoing basis by the commission.  The directory documents all of the amendments to primary legislation made since 1922 and is an important and perhaps essential source of information for legal professionals, legislators and indeed laypersons or any person who so wishes.<\/p> <p>I intend to return to the subject of access to law.<\/p><p> The ongoing maintenance of the directory assists the commission's work on the second accessibility project, which is what we call the statute law restatement project.  This provides administrative consolidation of the Acts, resulting in what are called restatements or revised Acts.  The process makes it easier to see the up-to-date text of the law.  It brings together in a single text all the amendments and changes made to individual statutes.  It is an ongoing and helpful service, which is also available on the commission's website.<\/p><p> Third, we maintain as a project the classified list of Acts in force in Ireland.  There are over 2,000 Acts classified within the list under 36 subject headings.  Each Act is linked to its relevant Department.  The project supplements and complements the others but does not necessarily provide the sort of access to law that we believe is necessary.<\/p><p> As stated, an establishing Act requires us to seek to provide for codification in addition to simplification and modernisation.  Codification is a topic that was discussed during our annual conference last year, notably by Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan.  Very few people would deny that the codification of our laws and their consequently greater accessibility to all citizens is a very desirable objective.  Very few would deny, however, that the achievement of that objective could take decades, even with the application of very great resources.  The reality is that the ordinary man or woman on the street simply believes that our laws are incomprehensible because, understandably, he or she cannot access them.  This is a perfectly reasonable position.  The commission should take responsibility for making our laws accessible.  It is an enormous project and would require enormous financial resources.  We know that.  It would require considerable time.  As indicated, it could take up to a century, but it would certainly take decades and considerable resources.  However, that does not mean we should not start.  We believe we have started to some extent but that we need to do so in a careful way that makes the law genuinely accessible.  We should proceed on a stage-by-stage basis.  The fact that our laws are not accessible does not preclude us from investigating whether and how we can commence an accessibility project on legislation.  Members may note that our 11th project operates very much on that basis. <\/p><p> I do not know whether the Chairman would like me to go through the various projects one by one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justice John Quirke","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380101700,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500010#L00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380101700,"counter":695,"content":"<p>If I may, I will call on my colleague to assist me in regard to each project.  The first project we are recommending concerns corporate offences and regulatory enforcement.  Members will not be surprised by the inclusion of this project within our proposed programme.  The issues of corporate offences and enforcement were given considerable attention during our annual conference.  That resulted, of course, from the events of recent years.<\/p><p>  In the expectation that this may form part of our programme, which expectation I hope is not misplaced, we have taken the liberty of doing a certain amount of research on this matter.  We believe, in the first instance, that it is necessary for us to examine our existing laws on the commission of offences, particularly criminal offences, that relate to corporate misconduct or inappropriate corporate behaviour.  For that purpose, we suggest we should examine our existing laws, such as they are, to determine whether they are sufficient and adequate.  If they are not, we suggest that we should investigate methods by which they can be improved.  Alternatively, new laws might need to be enacted to ensure that what has occurred will not recur.<\/p><p>  We will be considering the question of corporate criminal offences.  For that purpose, we anticipate international consultation with other common law countries, EU countries and the United States, where we believe there is experience.  We can give members some information on the position in our neighbouring jurisdiction, which has had similar difficulties.  We know there are laws in Australia covering offences that have not been enacted in this jurisdiction or the United Kingdom.  I refer in particular to section 184 of the Australian Corporations Act.  We can discover whether that has been successful.  We note that the authorities in New Zealand do not intend to enact similar legislation, and we need to find out why.<\/p><p>  There is a large range of white-collar criminal offences in the statute books in various parts of the United States and there are federal offences.  We would like to investigate whether these particular offences are effective in regard to the appropriate conduct of corporate law.  We intend to examine this in considerable detail.  We will also examine the question of deferred prosecution agreements, which the members may know about.  They are in force in parts of the United States.  The Federal Government of the United States operates with reference to that particular mechanism, which indicates that a party that has engaged in inappropriate corporate conduct may be prosecuted.  The prosecution may be deferred if the party under investigation co-operates with the prosecuting authority, is of assistance and, perhaps, co-operates with regard to information concerning other potential prosecutions.  At the conclusion of that process, the party concerned may have the prosecution deferred, dependent upon the nature and level of co-operation provided to the state.  We have considered this type of system and would like to do so more carefully.  We believe, in a very preliminary manner, that if it were to be adopted in this jurisdiction, it would certainly require significant judicial oversight, for all sorts of reasons with which members will probably be familiar.<\/p><p>  I am very much summarising what we are doing and what we intend to examine.  We will examine whether corporate offences of a criminal nature are in existence in our jurisdiction.  We know, for instance, that there is no offence of reckless trading and we will examine whether there should be.  We will examine what sorts of offences are in force in other jurisdictions and whether we should enact legislation that would make certain conduct a criminal offence.  We will examine other types of remedy, such as deferred prosecution agreements.  That is the first part.<\/p> <p>The second part we would like to look at is the question of regulation.  In that respect, we had some assistance during our conference in December from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, and also from the then regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield.  We believe that the whole question of the regulation of banking and financial institutions, and corporations generally, needs to be considered and investigated to see if it is adequate.  Mr. Elderfield was certainly of the view that administrative sanctions of one kind or another could be helpful in some circumstances and perhaps more appropriate and useful than criminal sanctions in the sense that they could be more readily dealt with.  They might not be as difficult to prove and might be less expensive than a full criminal prosecution.  In that respect, we are talking about potential financial penalties and reputational sanctions in what is known as naming and shaming, and also what is called the identification principle.  We can consider sanctions of that kind, which may or not have potential drawbacks or questions associated with them.  However, we would like to examine whether regulation of financial institutions and corporations generally could be improved by whatever methods, including the enactment of corporate powers for regulators to impose administrative sanctions.<\/p><p> The third part of this project is an examination of whether regulators generally should be provided with powers of a particular kind.  By that we mean not just regulators dealing with financial institutions, banks or corporations but also the Medicines Board, the Commission for Energy Regulation and all sorts of other regulators.  We must examine whether it is feasible, possible or desirable to enact legislation which would confer particular powers upon all sorts of regulators - possibly identified regulators, but a large number.  As far as I am aware, the only regulators who have the power to impose administrative sanctions are the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners.  Other regulators do have different types of powers but not the power to impose administrative sanctions. <\/p><p> Those are the three limbs of the project.  I am explaining this in a general fashion and am open to correction by my colleagues if I have misstated anything, but that is roughly what we are examining as regards that particular project.

That is uncontroversial.  The issue that arises here, and the reason we have put it on our agenda, is that for the past decade or more a problem has arisen - not exclusively, but in particular - whereby somebody who is charged with a sexual offence perhaps against a child, or a person who was a child many years ago when the offence was allegedly committed, may seek discovery of material relating to the complainant which is not in the possession of the DPP but is in the possession of a health board, a doctor, a rape crisis centre or a counsellor.  As Mr. Justice Quirke has said, it is a sensitive issue because there are a number of competing interests at stake.  There is the right of the accused person to a fair trial, which would point to the discovery or disclosure of the material.  However, the material which they are seeking to have disclosed will often be of a deeply personal and private nature.  There may be content in that material which is not strictly relevant or necessary.<\/p><p>  This is something that the High Court and the Supreme Court have almost had the opportunity to deal with on several occasions over the past decade.  It always so happened, however, that some settlement was reached prior to the date on which the case was due to be heard.  The last occasion was a case that came before the Supreme Court a few years ago involving this kind of issue, as it happens in a manslaughter case, but the matter was settled. <\/p><p>  The reason we think this is something that would be uniquely suited to being considered by the Law Reform Commission - and I gather the Department of Justice and Equality may also be considering it - is that there are so many different constituencies that need to be heard.  They include, for example, people in the medical, caring and legal professions as well as victim support groups.  All their voices need to be heard.  There are a few useful models from Canada, Australia and elsewhere which are probably quite readily adaptable in this country but it is just a question of deciding which one is the best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500011#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom O'Malley"},{"type":"speech","time":1380102300,"counter":702,"content":"<p>That is very interesting and I can see the issues involved.

It has been in existence for well over a century but it was given a statutory foundation in 2006 in section 99, which is now rather infamous because it has caused an enormous amount of legal problems in terms of the detail of its implementation and has constantly been the subject of judicial reviews in the courts.  Therefore, we thought it would be a good idea to look at the suspended sentence to review the way in which section 99 has operated and to deal with any outstanding aspects.<\/p><p>  Again, I am speaking off the cuff but no more than previous stories, it is fair to say that perhaps the Department, the Director of Public Prosecutions and other State offices might already be looking at the technical side of this.

One arose in the context of what should happen to jointly owned property, property held under joint tenancies, when the co-owner has unlawfully killed his or her co-owner.  There is a decision of Miss Justice Mary Laffoy to the effect that the co-ownership rights, being property rights or whatever, would continue notwithstanding the unlawful killing but that there would be deemed by the court to be a constructive trust for one half share.  It is a very technical, complex question which raises questions of property rights, the meaning of joint tenancy, the meaning of succession etc.  It would be a discrete question.  Miss Justice Laffoy, in the course of her judgement, identified the need for clarity in the legislation as to what should happen and we had a number of requests on that topic, so it seems worthwhile to include it in a review of the Succession Act.  It is not proposed that the entire succession scheme be reviewed but that a number of issues be identified.<\/p><p>  Another anomalous situation was identified recently in another case, namely, the admissibility of a conviction of murder regarding an application under section 120 of the Succession Act which allows the court to declare somebody to be unworthy to succeed.  One kills one's spouse, one is convicted of murder or manslaughter, but one is not necessarily excluded from inheritance on intestacy or under intestate succession.  Section 120 of the Act has four or five subsections.  Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns recently identified a difference in the wording between subsections (1) and (4) as giving rise to this problem.  Is the conviction admissible in a civil trial?  Is it hearsay evidence?  Clearly, it is.  Is it admissible?  What weight is to be given to it?  Is it to be conclusive evidence of the fact of unlawful killing or <i>prima facie<\/i> evidence?  Can one re-try the question again?  That is a fairly discrete issue but seems to deserve some inquiry and we would not think of it as taking a very long time.<\/p><p>  Those two issues arose from particular cases where the points were raised by the courts, but another issue arose in the context of our consultation process.  Section 117 of the Succession Act allows the child of a testator to come to court to seek provision to be made.  If it can be shown that proper provision was not made for the child, the court can make proper provision and the court is at large as to how it makes that provision.  The original 1960 Act provided for a 12 month time limit, but that was reduced in 1995 to six months and there is no availability under the legislation for an extension of time.  In the UK, there is the possibility of applying to the court in exceptional circumstances for an extension of time.<\/p><p>  A number of persons who wrote to us following our consultation process suggested that perhaps that was harsh and needed to be examined to determine whether there are circumstances where the court could grant an extension of time.  A period of six months is very short.  The legislation was designed to ensure an estate can be administered with due expedition.  We do not want people coming back ten years later, but perhaps six months might cause some harshness or unfair results in certain circumstances.<\/p><p>  Another interesting and perhaps discrete question that was identified by somebody who wrote to us was an issue that has arisen following the enactment of the civil partnership legislation.  On the death intestate of a married person, the children automatically receive one third, but on the death intestate of a civil partner, the child of the civil partner may seek more and may go to court for a declaration for whatever percentage the court decides is appropriate.  A number of people who wrote in suggested to us that this perhaps creates an anomalous distinction.  It may or may not be a deliberate distinction that deserves to be drawn but it certainly bears examining.  We thought of the Succession Act project as comprising relatively discrete topics, but this legislation is almost 50 years old.  Some examination of it would not go astray and there were a number of requests from members of the legal profession on issues that arose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500014#P01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Baker"},{"type":"speech","time":1380104100,"counter":751,"content":"<p>It is really fascinating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500014#P01100","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380104100,"counter":752,"content":"<p>Absolutely, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013092500014#P01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Marie Baker"},{"type":"speech","time":1380104100,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I do not know why anybody says the law is boring.

It was not possible to do readily what we are proposing when Acts appeared in print form only.  However, now it is very easy to slot in and revise the sections.  It is possible to check out a New Zealand criminal Act from 1961 on the Internet and find that it is updated to today.

Provision is made for the NTA to have anyone seeking a vehicle licence vetted.  Anyone who looks for a driver's licence is vetted every five years.  Vehicle licences are granted every year and the NTA can vet anyone if required and there is reasonable cause to do so.  This is enough power for the NTA which it can use as necessary.  Another reason I am not willing to accept the amendment - the Deputy will appreciate this - is that as vehicle licences are issued annually vetting would have to be undertaken in hundreds of thousands of instances.  I accept the bona fides of the Deputy and the reasonable arguments he has made, but it would require a huge amount of extra manpower to go through all of the licence applications.

This would mean that it would not have to be done by the next renewal date because I accept this process would be cumbersome and labour intensive.  Once somebody was vetted, it could, as in the case of a medical check, remain valid for three to five years.  There are concerns that people with a significant criminal past find their way into the industry and that this has not been taken into account.  We need a stronger requirement that the NTA, over a period of time, ensure anybody involved in the business be subject to some level of Garda checks.

However, it is inappropriate for me to specify such an exclusion in the context of this proposed legislation.  I remind Deputies that this is a taxi Bill.  Section 10 of the Bill provides for the consideration of such offences in the assessment of suitability of a licence applicant or licence holder.  Sections 28 and 29 concern mandatory disqualification for conviction for the most serious of offences and an obligation to notify conviction of these offences to the licensing authority.<\/p><p>  The point at issue in the taxi legislation is the safety of passengers, who are in a vulnerable position in a taxi.  Nevertheless, because of the restriction that this places over the ability of persons to participate in the industry, the grounds for mandatory disqualification is for legal reasons narrowly defined.  It is not possible in legislation to seek to further define instances where there may be mitigating circumstances that justify the non-application of the disqualification.  This is the reason the Taxi Regulation Bill makes specific provision for an appeal to the courts in regard to mandatory disqualification - so that exceptions are possible where the courts determine it appropriate.  The courts are positioned to make that kind of judgment.  It is clearly stated in section 28, subsection (10), that in determining whether to grant or refuse such an application the court can have regard to any other matter that it considers relevant.<\/p><p>  I am not prepared to accept an amendment to this Bill that would give special treatment to one category of convicts.

The issue came under the spotlight in the &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot; programme broadcast in May 2011 whereby part-time SPSV drivers were found to be engaged in other employment driving public service vehicles and driving excessively long hours at a risk to the safety of passengers, themselves and other road users.  I am sure all of the Deputies present are aware of the issue. <\/p><p>  While the policy principle underpinning the section concerning the regulation of SPSV drivers' hours for the purposes of passenger and road safety is sound, I am informed by the advisory counsel in the Attorney General's office that some aspects of section 11, depending on how it is interpreted and applied, could give rise to a legal challenge concerning a person's rights.  The amendment will allow for an obligation on a licence applicant or holder in the case of all other employment to inform the authority and that in the case of other employment involving driving a vehicle the person has an added obligation to show to the authority that the employer has been notified.<\/p><p>  I am assured by the advisory counsel that such a provision will not raise difficulties in terms of constitutional rights or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is entirely reasonable that the Oireachtas can require that an employer, where the other occupation involves driving, be aware of the fact that an employee may be driving a taxi in order that the employer in question can satisfy himself or herself that the employee is capable of safely discharging driving activities connected with his or her employment.  The provisions of section 11 will relate to the NTA powers under section 19 to make SPSV regulations concerning the period a driver may drive an SPSV, which would apply to both whole-time and part-time taxi drivers, and the intervals of rest between driving an SPSV having driven a vehicle in the course of other employment.  In addition, the section makes it an offence under section 11(4) to fail to provide for the licensing authority the information on other occupations required by the section.  The offence under section 11(4) is proposed as a fixed payment offence for the purposes of section 46 and as a demerit offence for the purposes of Part 5 of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500006#E02200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099300,"counter":888,"content":"<p>I welcome the amendment as I raised the matter on Second Stage.

The proposed amendments seek to ensure section 11 would specifically refer to persons holding or applying for a taxi licence who are also in other full-time employment, thereby leading to a constraint for full-time employees in other occupations from operating in the taxi industry.  I understand where the Deputy is coming from and appreciate his concerns.  I sympathise with full-time taxi drivers in the industry who operate in compliance with the regulations and find themselves in an increasingly competitive working environment and working longer hours with less potential to attract fares than in stronger economic times.  However, as I have explained regarding the proposed restatement of section 11, there are very narrow parameters within which the obligation to inform the authority of other occupations can be applied.<\/p> <p>I have really gone as far as I can, legally, in this respect.  It is something we needed to work on as we had to ensure the issue was completely defined, with less potential of legal risk concerning a person's constitutional rights.  It is therefore not appropriate for me to introduce amendments Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, as the Deputy requires.<\/p><p> Sometimes we talk about the taxi industry and automatically think of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway etc.  The amendments proposed by the Deputy are well-meaning but they would have a dramatic impact on rural Ireland, where being a taxi driver is a part-time occupation.  I understand the spirit of the amendments but I cannot accept them.  Through the qualitative changes being effected by taxi regulations through the National Transport Authority and this legislation, I expect the conditions in the industry to improve.  My intention is to support the full-time taxi drivers to whom the Deputy refers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500006#E03200","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380099900,"counter":899,"content":"<p>Section 11 deleted.\r\n\r\n  Amendments Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, not moved.\r\nSECTION 12<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099900,"counter":900,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 20 to 25, inclusive are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500007#F00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099900,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 20:<blockquote><br \/>In page 18, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following subsection:&ldquo;(5) All decisions by the licensing authority which have the effect of limiting or interfering with the licence holder&rsquo;s ability to operate the licence shall be reviewed at the request of the licence holder, such request to be made within two weeks of the said decision to an independent adjudicator (such as the Office of the Ombudsman) for independent review.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>We propose to delete a subsection and replace it with some language seeking to deal with a dispute that might arise between the licensing authority and a licence holder.

It is like a domino effect.  I cannot agree to the deletion of section 12, which provides for the revocation of a licence or in some circumstances the suspension of a licence.  The Deputy has clarified his position.<\/p><p>  Action 22 of the taxi regulation review report recommended the commencement of section 35 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 concerning the appeal of a decision to refuse to grant, suspend or revoke a licence.  The Taxi Regulation Act 2003 envisages that the NTA would make regulations with regard to the criteria for revocation or suspension of a licence.  However, given the risk of challenge based on the constitutional principle concerning the right of a licence holder to earn a livelihood, which we have heard of in the courts, the view of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel was that the principles and criteria upon which the licensing authority would make such decisions should be set out in primary legislation in the Bill.  I must take it on board, as the Deputy knows.<\/p><p>  The licensing authority may revoke a licence if it is satisfied the person is no longer suitable to hold the licence and with regard to whether the person has contravened the obligations on a licence holder, including conditions of the licence or a code of practice and the nature and extent of the contravention.  There is also regard to failure or refusal to supply required information, or supply of false or misleading information; conviction of offences; requirements for health and safety of passengers and other road users, conduct of the person, or member of a company, which calls into question their suitability, as referred to earlier; and representations received by the licence holder.<\/p><p>  Contravention of licensing obligations, including the supply of information as required under the Bill and related regulations or licensing conditions could also lead to a suspension of a licence for a period no greater than three months.  The licensing authority may also decide to issue a notice to the licence holder with a reprimand, warning, caution or advice, on its own discretion.  Section 13 of the Bill provides for a comprehensive system of representations and appeals concerning licensing decisions by the licensing authority.<\/p><p>  It is not possible to provide in this Bill for the type of independent appeal being sought in this amendment.  As I understand it, the Office of the Ombudsman is not permitted to undertake investigations into matters that can be appealed to the court.  I do not consider that an appeal to the Ombudsman is more appropriate than an appeal to the court, and in this instance I will not be able to accept the Deputy's amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500007#F00700","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380099900,"counter":905,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n  Section 12 agreed to.\r\nSECTION 13<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099900,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 21:<blockquote><br \/>In page 18, subsection (1), line 19, to delete &ldquo;within 14 days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;not later than 14 days&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500007#F00900","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380099900,"counter":907,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099900,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<blockquote><br \/>In page 18, subsection (1), line 20, to delete &ldquo;after the date&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;from the date of the service&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500007#F01100","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380099900,"counter":909,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099900,"counter":910,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 23:<blockquote><br \/>In page 18, subsection (3), line 34, to delete &ldquo;within 28 days after the date of the notification&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo;not later than 28 days from the date of the service of the notification&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500007#F01300","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380099900,"counter":911,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099900,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 24:<blockquote><br \/>In page 18, subsection (6), line 47, after &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;resides or&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500007#F01500","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380099900,"counter":913,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099900,"counter":914,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 25:<blockquote><br \/>In page 19, subsection (8), line 5, to delete &ldquo;within 28 days of&rdquo; and substitute the following:&ldquo;not later than 28 days from the date of the service of the&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500007#F01700","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380099900,"counter":915,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.\r\n\r\n  Section 13, as amended, agreed to.\r\nSECTION 14<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380099900,"counter":916,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 26:<blockquote><br \/>In page 19, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:&ldquo;(3) A licence holder shall be prohibited from renting his or her licence or taxi to a holder of a stamp 2 visa.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>The Minister of State has already introduced a section which I complimented that deals with the part-time issue that has bedevilled the industry.

This visa is meant to allow people avail of education facilities in this country, and it is generally accepted that any temporary work - although not specifically pointed out - would be related to the direction of their education.

The number who have sought to get into the industry under the stamp 2 provisions is not as high as one might think.  I checked this with the National Transport Authority, NTA.

This issue was raised with me previously.  There are 929 SPSV licences out of just under 23,000 vehicle licences held by companies.  This amounts to 4%.  Provision for the granting of further licences to companies is contained in section 9(7) of the Bill.  All applicants for licences are required to meet the suitability requirements set out in section 10.  Subsection (2)(<i>e<\/i>) contains specific measures relating to the suitability of members of companies.<\/p><p>  The two key policy principles underlying the prohibition on transfer are that a licence should not have a value, which most Deputies accept, and that a licence should determine a person's suitability to carry out a function, which most Deputies will also accept.  However, where a company that holds a taxi licence is sold, there is potential to realise a value relating to a taxi licence - that is not open to an individual - and there is a possibility to enter the taxi business without the suitability checks envisaged in section 10, although it is acknowledged that this would be addressed at the time of licence renewal.<\/p><p>  The amendment provides that, in the case of a licence held by a company, upon the change in control in the company, that is, when the person or persons who control the company change or there is a change of half or more of the company shareholding in one or more transactions, the licence stands revoked.  The exception is where the change in control is as a result of death.  I discussed this issue with a number of the taxi unions and following those discussions, I acceded to their request.  The new provision ensures there is parity between all SPSV licence holders with regard to the prohibition on transfer of a licence, whether the licence is held by a company or an individual.

While I will not be accepting the amendments, I have some sympathy with the proposal, which seeks to address the concerns of many taxi drivers who feel that they are regularly being undercut by other taxi operators.  This is one of a number of amendments with which I have some degree of sympathy.  However, I must deal with this from a legal and regulatory perspective and accept the advice that is given.  It is not possible to make such a legislative provision in the Bill which would effectively create a price floor.  The taximeter area for the purposes of setting a maximum fare is the State, as provided for in the Bill.  Under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, the setting of maximum taxi fares is a statutory function of the NTA.  A review of taxi fares is carried out every two years by the authority.  Under the fares review this year, the NTA put forward a proposal to simplify the overall fare structure and to provide an approximate 3.6% to 4% increase in the maximum allowable fares.  However, following consultation with the taxi advisory committee and the various different taxi groups, it was decided not to make any changes to the existing fares structure.<\/p><p>  It is important that legitimate and compliant operators are not undermined by rogue operators who cut costs by not adhering to the rules.  A major focus of the reforms that I am bringing to the taxi sector is to make it impossible for non-compliant operators to continue in business.  We have already set up data-sharing arrangements between the NTA and both the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection, which has yielded some very interesting information.  In the Bill we are providing for a much more effective enforcement regime through the demerit system and expanded provisions for on-the-spot fines.  This is a better approach to promoting fair competition rather than having rigid pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500009#H03100","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1380101100,"counter":963,"content":"<p>I am not sure why the term \"national\" is preferred over \"maximum\".

The NTA has received a substantial number of complaints about persons offering unlicensed vehicles for booking online, in newspapers and other publications and at venues such as wedding fairs.  This is a source of significant frustration for licensed operators who operate licensed vehicles.  Wedding cars are displayed at wedding fairs and bookings for them are taken on the day of the fair.  However, at the time of booking the vehicle is not licensed.  If operators are unlicensed the NTA enforcement officers have no right to examine their records and see what bookings they have taken.  Up until they provide the service, they have done nothing illegal.  This makes it virtually impossible to enforce the provisions.  It is an unforeseen anomaly.<\/p><p> Without knowing what bookings were taken, the NTA enforcement officers cannot know where and when the service will be operated in order to confirm the contravention, notwithstanding the practical issues with stopping wedding or funeral vehicles.  On a policy level, this practice of being permitted to advertise while unlicensed, and take bookings for services which are, in general, regulated from a public safety perspective, is encouraging unlicensed activities and is detrimental to the operation of the regulatory system.  This is another instance in which I am seeking to ensure that the NTA has the tools at its disposal to protect the interests of compliant service providers.  We need to deal with this anomaly and I would appreciate the Deputies' co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500009#H03800","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380101700,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.

section:39.&mdash;(1) Where an authorised person, having inspected, examined or tested under <i>section 38 <\/i>a small public service vehicle or a vehicle purporting to be such a vehicle, is satisfied&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) that the vehicle is not roadworthy,<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) that there is a defect affecting the vehicle rendering it unfit for the carriage of passengers, or<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) that an approved policy of insurance (within the meaning of section 62 of the Act of 1961) in accordance with regulations made under <i>section 54 <\/i>is not in force in respect of the vehicle, he or she may require of the person in charge of the vehicle, or premises where the vehicle is at, that the vehicle not be used (within the meaning of &ldquo;use&rdquo; in <i>section 21(6)<\/i>) for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward until an authorised person, following, as appropriate, a further inspection, examination or test of the vehicle at a specified time and place, is satisfied that the vehicle is roadworthy, that the defect has been remedied, that the vehicle is adequately insured or the appropriate standard or requirement is complied with, as the case may be.<\/blockquote>(2) In addition to a requirement made under <i>subsection (1) <\/i>concerning a small public service vehicle or a vehicle purporting to be such a vehicle, an authorised person may seize and detain the internal, or external, signage or identification, or both, on or in the vehicle until following a further inspection, examination or test, an authorised person is satisfied that the vehicle is roadworthy, that the defect has been remedied, that the vehicle is adequately insured or the appropriate standard or requirement is complied with, as the case may be.<br \/>(3) Where a person fails to comply with <i>subsection (1)<\/i>, an authorised person may seize and detain one or more of the following:<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) internal, or external, vehicle signage, in or on the vehicle concerned;<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) any identification, in or on the vehicle concerned;<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) the vehicle concerned.<\/blockquote>(4) Where following a search, inspection or examination of a vehicle under <i>section 38<\/i>, an authorised officer is satisfied that&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) the vehicle is not licensed in accordance with licensing regulations, or<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the vehicle is carrying or displaying internal or external signage or identification (including a licence number) which does not relate to or apply to the vehicle or which is forged or altered in any way, the officer may seize and detain the signage or identification or the vehicle or all of them.<\/blockquote>(5) The Authority may issue guidelines to authorised persons for the purposes of this section.<br \/>(6) An authorised person who is not a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall not seize a vehicle under this section unless accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br \/>(7) A person who claims an interest in a vehicle or internal or external vehicle signage seized under this section may, not later than 60 days after its seizure, apply to a judge of the District Court within whose district the seizure was effected for an order directing the return to that person of the thing and the judge shall upon the hearing of the application&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) if satisfied that the seizure of the thing was properly carried out, confirm the seizure and detention, or<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) if not so satisfied, order the return to the person of the thing seized.<\/blockquote>(8) A judge of the District Court may adjourn an application under <i>subsection (7) <\/i>where he or she is satisfied the thing in question is, or is likely to be, required as evidence in any civil or criminal proceedings.<br \/>(9) Where a person who claims an interest in a vehicle or internal or external vehicle signage seized under this section&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) does not make an application to the District Court within the period referred to in <i>subsection (7)<\/i>, or<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) does make such an application within that period and the Court dismisses the application or the person withdraws it, the Authority may dispose of it.<\/blockquote>(10) The Authority may make regulations providing for the detention, removal, storage and subsequent release or disposal of a thing seized and detained under this section by an authorised person.<br \/>(11) Regulations under <i>subsection (10) <\/i>may, in particular and without prejudice to the generality of that subsection&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) authorise and provide for the recovery, from the owners of vehicles detained, removed, stored, released or disposed of, of charges in accordance with a prescribed scale, in respect of such detention, removal, storage, release or disposal,<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) provide that vehicles seized and detained under this section shall not, unless ordered to be returned under <i>subsection (7)(b)<\/i>, be released until any costs associated with the seizure and detention are paid,<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) provide for the waiver or deferral of the charges mentioned in <i>paragraph (a) <\/i>in such circumstances as may be specified in the regulations,<br \/>(<i>d<\/i>) provide for the release, by or on behalf of persons referred to in <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>, of vehicles removed or stored to such persons and upon such conditions as may be specified in the regulations,<br \/>(<i>e<\/i>) authorise and provide for the sale (or the disposal otherwise than by sale), by or on behalf of persons referred to in <i>paragraph (a)<\/i>, of vehicles removed or stored and provide for the disposal of moneys received in respect of such sale or other disposal,<br \/>(<i>f<\/i>) provide for the release of a vehicle that is not to be further used as a small public service vehicle and any written undertakings to be given in that regard by the person seeking the release.<\/blockquote>(12) Where a vehicle is seized under <i>subsection (3) <\/i>in respect of a matter referred to in <i>paragraph (c) <\/i>of <i>subsection (1)<\/i>, the Authority may release the vehicle where a person who has an interest in the vehicle, within the period referred to in <i>subsection(7)<\/i>, produces to an authorised officer an approved policy of insurance referred to in that paragraph.<br \/>(13) Where, before the expiration of the period of 6 months commencing on the date of the disposal of a vehicle by the Authority, a person satisfies the Authority that he or she was the owner of the vehicle at the time of its disposal, the Authority shall pay him or her any proceeds from the disposal less the sum of the charges due for the detention, removal and storage of the vehicle and the expenses reasonably incurred in the disposal of the vehicle.<br \/>(14) Any monies paid for the release of a vehicle under this section shall accrue to the Authority and shall be disposed of in a manner determined by the Authority, with the agreement of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>Section 39 in the Bill is to be replaced by this proposed amendment.  In the amendment, subsections (1) and (4) set out more precisely what constitutes a contravention of the prohibition on the use of vehicles under section 39 for which a vehicle and signage can be seized and detained.  These are: the vehicle is unroadworthy or defective, rendering it unfit for the carriage of persons; there is no approved policy of insurance for the vehicle; or the vehicle is not licensed or is carrying SPSV signage which does not relate to the vehicle or is forged.<\/p> <p> In particular, the amendment will enable the National Transport Authority to seize the roof sign and the tamper-proof discs when finding a vehicle operating unlicensed.  The power is currently provided for under an amendment to section 43(6) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, inserted by Schedule 1 of the Public Transport Act 2009, and is very frequently invoked by the National Transport Authority.<\/p><p> To ensure proportionality in the treatment of persons under the section, provision has been made in the amendment for a procedure whereby persons can apply to a judge of a District Court to have their vehicle or items returned.  The amendment also provides for a process whereby the authority can dispose of seized vehicles or items and the associated costs.  These modifications will ensure that there is a proportionate and legally robust regulatory framework governing the seizure of equipment by the authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500010#J05500","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380102300,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380102300,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>Section 39 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380102300,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>Sections 40 to 42, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380102300,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>SECTION 43<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380102300,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>Members should note that the text proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 65 is to be inserted before the word \"under\" where it occurs for the second time on line 14 on page 50.

The payment will be double the amount specified in the original fixed payment notice.  This effective third fixed payment period mirrors the provisions under section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 with regard to fixed charge offences for contraventions of the road traffic legislation.  It is envisaged that this proposed provision will be commenced at such time as the third payment option comes into effect under road traffic legislation.  This facilitates greater clarity concerning the SPSVs that are in future to be specified as fixed payment offences under section 46 of the Bill.  Fixed charges are to be enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as provided for under section 61 of the Bill.  This standardises the situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500012#L00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380102900,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380102900,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>Section 47 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380102900,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380102900,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 83 to 93, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500012#L00600","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1380102900,"counter":1090,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 83:<blockquote><br \/>In page 53, before section 48, but in Part 6, to insert the following new section:&ldquo;PART 7<br \/>OTHER NON-TAXI SERVICES<br \/>CHAPTER 1<br \/><i>Community Transport Service<\/i><br \/>48.&mdash;In this Part&mdash;<blockquote>&ldquo;approved community transport service&rdquo; means a community transport service granted an exemption;<br \/>&ldquo;approved vehicle&rdquo; means a mechanically propelled vehicle approved by the Authority for the purpose of the carriage of passengers in respect of a community transport service;<br \/>&ldquo;approved volunteer driver&rdquo; means a driver approved by the Authority to drive an approved vehicle to carry a passenger in the course of providing a community transport service;<br \/>&ldquo;charity&rdquo; means a body of persons or a trust established for charitable purposes only;<br \/>&ldquo;charitable tax exemption&rdquo; means an exemption from income tax granted, under section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, by the Revenue Commissioners to a charity;<br \/>&ldquo;community transport service&rdquo; means a transport service provided&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) by a person concerned for the social and welfare needs of one or more communities,<br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) without a gain for the person providing the service or another, and<br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) where the fare or payment for a journey or in respect of passengers using the service does not exceed the cost of providing the service in respect of the journey;<\/blockquote>&ldquo;exemption&rdquo; means an exemption, granted to the operator of a community transport service under <i>section 50**<\/i>, from the requirements of licensing regulations;<br \/>&ldquo;volunteer driver&rdquo; means a person who drives a mechanically propelled vehicle in the course of providing a community transport service and receives no reward for his or her services other than the payment to him or her of any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by him or her.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>Amendments Nos. 83 to 93, inclusive, constitute a new part of the Bill which provides for the application and grant of an exemption from the prohibition on operating an SPSV service without a licence under section 21 of the Bill.  This will remove any ambiguity concerning the continued operation of services such as community transport services and other non-taxi services in the context of licensing requirements under the Bill.  This issue has been raised with me by Members from all parties across the House.  <\/p><p>  Chapter 1 provides for the process of application and grant of exemption by the authority.  The criteria for the grant of an exemption are set out in chapter 1.  For example, with regard to community transport services, these are differentiated by the fact that they have a charitable tax exemption and are provided for on a non-for-profit basis.  Many of these community transport services are currently operated under the rural transport programme which is administered by the NTA and for which I have a responsibility.  <\/p><p>  Chapter 2 provides for the exemption of other non-taxi services from the SPSV regulations, as specified by regulations by the NTA, setting out the conditions for the grant of such an exemption.  The chapter sets out the conditions under which such exemptions can be made - that the vehicle is not being used in the course of carrying on a business; and that the driver receives no reward or gain; or is operating the vehicle under a contract of employment for the carriage of the person who owns or is in possession of the vehicle.<\/p><p>  Chapter 3 provides for administration of the exemptions, including a process of representation and appeal with regard to decisions of the NTA concerning exemptions for fees or a register of exemptions, and for the powers of authorised persons to enforce the exemptions to ensure that the holder of the exemption is operating services in accordance with the exemption as granted by the NTA in its terms and conditions. <\/p><p>  These amendments are essentially to establish a clear regulatory framework that takes account of the variety of services now being provided and to ensure that the offence provisions in the Act are clearly targeted.<\/p><p>  I have received representations on this issue from a broad political spectrum in order to deal with an anomaly that has continued for many years.  That is why I have chosen to deal with it in this part of the Bill.  It took a while to introduce the legal clarities but I am now happy to do so.  I ask members of the select sub-committee for their support in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52013092500012#L00700","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1380102900,"counter":1091,"content":"<p>It is right to bring forward this amendment.
