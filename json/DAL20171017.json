Their deaths illustrate the serious nature of the devastating storm and the importance of the work of first responders and the national emergency co-ordination group, chaired by Mr. Sean Hogan.  I pay tribute to them and Mr. Hogan who calmly and diligently, with all those involved, worked to protect the people and minimise the damage, above all, to them and, secondly, to property.  First responders deserve great credit - members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, fire service personnel, members of the Army and Civil Defence, as well as the ESB and, particularly, local authorities, local councils, which co-ordinated the emergency efforts at county and local level, again to minimise loss of live and damage.  The national broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, with TV3, local radio stations and the media, played a very important public service role in disseminating information to the public at large.  Above all, Met &Eacute;ireann played a very important role.  It nailed it in its forecasting in advance of the storm and its work throughout to keep people briefed.  If any organisation deserves substantial resources from here on, it is Met &Eacute;ireann.  I put it to the Taoiseach that this needs to happen.<\/p>  <p>  In the light of this, I ask the Taoiseach to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of our preparations for and response to Storm Ophelia will take place.  That is important when an event of this magnitude occurs.  We know that ESB crews are out bravely restoring power to people's homes.  Water supplies and so on are also being restored.  I also ask that a national audit be undertaken by the local authorities.  Will the Taoiseach initiate such an audit in the context of providing ring-fenced funding to deal with damaged and dangerous trees.  Many communities and pensioners will not be in a position to fund the cutting down of dangerous trees, of which there will be many around the country because of the impact of the storm.<\/p><p>It would be useful to undertake a comprehensive audit of the response and ring-fence funding, in addition to ordinary local authority funds, to undertake that comprehensive work.<\/p> <p> Yesterday's storm is a reminder that the Atlantic is warming and that the frequency and intensity of storms such as this will increase.  I do not wish to be political in the context of the national effort which was made, but Ireland is not meeting its climate change targets and we must step up our efforts significantly to respond to them.  <\/p> <p> Is the Taoiseach interested in working with other parties in this House to review legislation to make it an offence to disobey safety warnings during a major weather event such as this?  There was a lot of anger yesterday that the lives of first responders had been put at risk by needless activity.  It is important that, as the Legislature, this House show cause by protecting first responders and creating a far greater awareness of the dangers inherent in such reckless activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508245500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>It is always possible to learn lessons and strengthen future responses in the case of a national emergency.  Today the Cabinet decided that it would undertake a full evaluation of our response once the clean-up was complete and power and water had been restored to everyone in the country.  It will take place prior to the next meeting of the Office of Emergency Planning in November.<\/p>  <p>  I very much agree with the Deputy's sentiments about people disobeying safety warnings.  Not only did those who disobeyed safety warnings put themselves at risk, but they also risked the lives of members of the emergency services.  There were two incidents yesterday which almost cost the lives of members of the emergency services and we were close to many more fatalities than were suffered yesterday.  It was the worst storm to hit Ireland in 50 years or more.  It was the first time there was a national alert which was declared on Sunday, 15 October at 1 p.m.  As the Deputy noted, the storm did take three lives, those of Clare O'Neill, Fintan Goss and Michael Pyke.  Everyone in the House offers his or her condolences to their families, friends, communities and all those grieving today.<\/p>  <p>  What I witnessed on Sunday and yesterday was public service at its very best.  We can all be very proud of the public service today.  The national emergency co-ordination centre and the national emergency co-ordination group worked very well.  I extend my particular thanks to the staff who all continue to work from Kildare Street today, the emergency services, local authority staff, the staff of Departments, Met &Eacute;ireann, the transport companies, health service staff who worked extra shifts and often covered shifts for others who were unable to get to work, the Defence Forces, volunteers, including those in Civil Defence and many others.  Decisions were made swiftly and communicated well.  As a result the loss of life and limb was minimised.  Today the clean-up is under way; roads are being made passable, while homes and businesses without power are being reconnected.  Some 170,000 homes and businesses have been reconnected since 3 p.m. yesterday.  There are 6,700 staff and contractors on the ground assisting in the clean-up and making repairs.  <\/p>  <p>  This morning's Cabinet meeting discussed routine business and also Storm Ophelia.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, updated the Cabinet on this morning's meeting of the national emergency co-ordination group which he had attended on the Government's behalf.  We have informed local authorities that they will receive additional resources to enable them to continue with the clean-up and that the provision of additional resources needed for road and infrastructure repairs will be considered in the normal way once they have been assessed and costed.  The Defence Forces remain available to assist and aid the civil power on request.<\/p>  <p>  Some 515,000 homes and businesses remain without power.  By tomorrow morning all will have an indicative date for reconnection.  Most will be reconnected within three to four days, but in some cases it may take up to ten days.  Extra crews are coming here from Britain, Northern Ireland and France.  I ask people to bear in mind that it is highly specialised work which cannot be done by anyone, only by trained staff and we must always ensure their health and safety.  <\/p>  <p>  Schools will reopen tomorrow when school buses will run as normal.  The national emergency co-ordination group will continue to meet.<\/p><p>When it comes to water supplies there are about 80,000 homes without water, but tankers are being deployed as necessary in areas where water is not available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700004#B00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508245800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply, and I welcome the fact a comprehensive evaluation of the preparations and reaction to storm Ophelia will take place to inform future practice and future behaviour in what will become a pattern over the next number of years in terms of the frequency and intensity of such storms.

The ten year capital plan will, of course, have to take into account the need to adapt to climate change, for example, electrification of some of our railways and other such investments and further investment in flood defences and other such adaptions, recognising the fact that while we cannot put any one storm down to climate change it is a scientific fact that we will see more storms and more severe weather events in the years ahead so we need to prepare for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700005#C00500","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1508245800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I join with the Taoiseach and all of the House in our expressions of sympathy to and solidarity with the families and loved ones of Clare O'Neill, Michael Pyke and Fintan Goss.

The changes were made and the consequences were known at the time to the Government.<\/p><p>It was well understood that they would have a disproportionate impact on women.

Indeed, the Taoiseach's own Minister for Finance described the situation as \"bonkers and unbelievable\" but it seems it was not bonkers enough to be addressed in his recent budget.  In our budget, Sinn F&eacute;in did provide for this reversal.  It would cost the Exchequer &euro;70 million but the Government chose to ignore this proposal.  Both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il voted against a Sinn F&eacute;in motion in the D&aacute;il last December that called for the 2012 changes to be reversed and for a remedy to be implemented.  The Taoiseach, therefore, has had two significant opportunities in the past ten months to demonstrate he is on the side of these women, and he has reneged on both, leaving the women high and dry.<\/p> <p> It seems that something happened at the weekend for the Soldiers of Destiny - not an epiphany or genuine realisation that they were wrong on this matter.

It existed not in law but in many employments before that year.  People who understand the pensions system will know that any public servant hired before 1995 pays PRSI at a lower rate, the 0.9% rate, and that rate does not entitle any public servant hired before 1995 to the State contributory pension, whether married or single, male or female, marriage-barred or not.  It is important, therefore, not to confuse the 2012 change with the marriage bar because they are quite separate issues.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the changes of 2012, they did not just affect women, they affected men as well.  Depending on whose estimates one accepts, the difference is about 60:40.  Therefore, women were disproportionately affected.  It did affect men as well as women, however, and it is important not to ignore all those men who did not deserve a mention in the Deputy's question.  They were also affected by the change.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to bear in mind that going back to the pre-2012 system is not necessarily fair either because it also had anomalies built into it.  The most obvious of these was that somebody who paid 20 contributions, on average, got a 98% pension whereas somebody who paid 48 contributions, on average, got a 100% pension.  Therefore, somebody who paid more than twice as many contributions got only 2% more in her or his pension.  If a change is to be made to these rules, it should not be made in isolation because all one would do is throw up new anomalies and injustices.  As a Government, we do accept there are anomalies in the system, the averaging one being the most obvious in that regard.  Again, it is separate from the 2012 issue.<\/p><p> The Government believes any changes need to be carefully considered.  They should not be done in isolation but comprehensively so as not to create new injustices or new anomalies.  We should understand the full costs.  We should answer the question of retrospectivity and whether it would apply to people who are already retired or just to people who are retiring now.  We would need to understand who may gain and who may lose out from any change in the rules.  Sometimes changing the rules can cause people to lose out as well as gain.  We would need to profile the individual loss and we would also have to look at the impact on poverty.  We should bear in mind that pensioner poverty among men in Ireland is higher than it is among women, which is something that often goes unreported.<\/p> <p> A lot of work has been done in this regard by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The first part was the publication of an actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund because any money that is paid out from the State pension, contributory, has to be paid in from the fund so one would have to work out how additional money would be raised for that fund.  The actuarial review is completed and will be published quite soon.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will soon publish a detailed document on the total contributions approach for public consultation.  It is the new approach we want to move to, whereby everyone's contribution is counted and it does not matter when one makes them; what counts is the total number one makes throughout one's working career.  That would also provide a generous disregard for those who took time out to look after children or disabled people in their home.  The response should be comprehensive, not piecemeal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700006#D00800","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508246700,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did not answer the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700007#E00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1508246700,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I fully accept that pensioner poverty is an issue that affects men as well as women, but it is also a fact that the changes made in 2012 disproportionately affect women.

As complex as pensions are and the rules and regulations concerning them, it is not complicated to understand that a change was made in 2012 which is costing thousands of people, disproportionately women, up to &euro;30 a week.  Those people, and those women, have campaigned long and hard and I imagine have lobbied every Member of the D&aacute;il on this issue, and they tell me they have received assurances from every party in the D&aacute;il that the 2012 changes will be reversed.

The first relates to how red alerts are understood.  On Sunday night, we saw many companies unsure how to deal with their employees.  Should we not have a clear understanding throughout the economy, as is the case in the education sector, of what should be done in the event of a red alert?  I came across a report last year that goes back to 2010.  The current Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, was the Minister responsible at the time.  It related to establishing a national text alert system.  Public broadcasters are well and good but we could have a system, as envisaged in the 2010 report, where every individual in an affected area would have a specific warning.  Is that something the Government will now look at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700008#F00400","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247300,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Howlin for his kind words about our public servants and everyone who helped out yesterday and today with the clean-up.

We will need to examine what a national red alert means.  It was the first time we have ever had a national red alert and the whole country only went red on Sunday, 15 October, at 1 p.m., when certain decisions had to be made.  One decision was to close schools and that was made within a few hours of the national red alert issuing.  A decision was made that we could not leave it up to individual school boards and so on to decide and that it had to be done on a national basis.  It caused genuine confusion for some people in the private sector because it was unclear to people as to whether or not they were to go into work.  The advice we gave people was not to do any unessential travel but going to work is essential for many people.  We will have to develop a better understanding of what a red alert means beyond the public sector and what it means in the private sector.<\/p> <p> I am not sure if a national text alert is still in the offing.  SMS is used much less frequently than it was in the past.  It is probably dying out as a technology.  People tend to use WhatsApp, Internet messages and so on.  Any consideration would have to give some view to that and what the correct mechanism for informing people would be.  I would like to say, as Deputy Martin said, that the media, and the national media in particular, were very helpful in getting messages out, including RTE, TV3 and others.  The front page headlines on the newspapers on Monday morning were also very helpful.  I do not think anyone who saw the front pages of the major newspapers on Monday morning could be in any doubt as to how serious the storm was.<\/p> <p> The national adaptation framework consultation is open until 27 October, so we are still in the consultation phase.  Once the Minister has the opportunity to consider the submissions, it will be brought to Government and published thereafter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700008#F00700","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508247600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to having a full and proper debate on the climate mitigation plan.

I had conversations with members of the Government on Sunday evening and we decided to close our own offices around the country.  I had to ring people I had arranged to meet on Monday morning, including employers, who did not know what to do.  We need to know, when events like this might occur, what specifically is expected of employers and employees in the event of a red alert affecting their area of work.  A commitment by the Taoiseach to provide such guidelines would be very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700009#G00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1508247600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I am happy to give that commitment.

I also compliment the Government, local authorities and, in the county I represent, Ms Moira Murrell, who is CEO of Kerry County Council, and all the great outdoor staff for the great work that they did, not just in our county but throughout the country.  Those people worked so hard to ensure that everything was dealt with in the proper way.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the specific commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to protect our post office network.  I raised this matter many times here.<\/p><p>I wish to declare that I myself am a postmaster so I know the workings of exactly what is happening.<br\/><br\/>We, the Independent group, passed a motion in November of 2016.  I was grateful to every political group and individual here in this House who supported that motion at that time but, unfortunately, nothing has happened since.  A motion was passed here.  It gave a clear framework as to how we can protect our post offices.  It is not an exaggeration to state that 700 post offices face insolvency in the next two years.  When every postmaster who has been revised - a revision takes place every two or three years - gets back his or her figures, the postmaster is losing a lot of money, to such an extent that it questions the post office's viability completely.<br\/><br\/> Does the Taoiseach understand that in 2012 the social welfare contract was worth &euro;60 million to the post offices?  Today, it is worth just over &euro;50 million.  Why did that happen?  First, it is Government policy.  The Department was actively encouraging recipients to leave their post offices and use the commercial banks.  The post office customers were being driven to commercial banks.  I give the Taoiseach credit that when he was Minister at that time and I raised it with him he acted and ensured that letters being sent out to recipients encouraging them to go to the banks also pointed out that they could use the post offices.  However, we must do more.  When I saw &quot;we&quot;, I mean every one of us - every political party and every individual here.  All we need do is recognise that community banking is what saved the post office network in other parts of the world.  It happened in New Zealand.  It did not happen in England and Scotland.  That is why they lost 10,000 post offices.<br\/><br\/>Anything we lose, as the Taoiseach well knows, we can never get back.  If a post office closes in a community it is like taking the heart and soul out of that community.  We have to recognise that the network is worth saving.  It can be saved but we need the Taoiseach and the Government to provide policies and direction that will direct more business and more activity to the post offices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700009#G00400","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508247900,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I reiterate that the Government is commitment to maintaining as much of the post office network as we can into the future.

Many groups and parties have consistently raised this issue, not least the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Chairman, Deputy Curran, met the Minister at the committee on 28 September, and the very first question  Deputy Curran put to her was about the anomaly.  The report of the committee suggested the suspension of 2012, pending the review the Taoiseach alluded to.  The motion was, of course, about more than just pensions.  It was a much larger and much longer motion.  To suggest we voted against the specific issue of pensions is distorting the truth.  I have to put that on the record.  That is not what happened.<\/p>  <p>  On promised legislation, the programme for Government states that climate change is the global challenge of our generation and requires radical and ambitious thinking.  I said earlier that we lack ambition and do not have a radical approach to meeting our climate change targets.  In that context, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Moran, responded to a question about a national flood forecasting service.  We are all very strong in our commendation of Met &Eacute;ireann in terms of its role in predicting and updating the country on storm Ophelia, but it has been looking for such national floods forecasting service for a long time.  A steering group was established and met on 11 occasions.  There has been an initial set-up phase.  It is estimated that it could take five years for such a service to be established.  Given the length of time that Met &Eacute;ireann has been looking for such a facility and the emphasis we put on climate change, it is regrettable that we do not have this in place.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Taoiseach, or the relevant Minister, will indicate the measures that will undertaken to accelerate the programme for Government provision and to make sure we have that forecasting service far earlier than the five years indicated, and that full resources will be provided for the recruitment of the 15 full-time staff who will be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700014#O00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508250300,"counter":89,"content":"<p>First, it is not the case that we lack ambition.

The problem with reducing the number and broadening the scope of each of the reduced committees is that we will have an extraordinarily large number attending.  That waters down their effectiveness.<\/p>  <p>  I would like the Taoiseach to answer on two specific issues, one of which is climate action.  Should there be a stand-alone committee dealing with the issue if we are to give it the sense of priority to which the House referred during Leaders' Questions?

The Citizens' Assembly stated we should be global leaders.  That is what it recommended to the Government and we are the opposite.

I am interested in this issue as it affects the committees.  It is the type of issue that comes in under every committee, in education and justice, as well as dealing with environmental issues.

It is fair to say Brexit took up the majority of the day's deliberations.  I did this because it was important to include the Cabinet in the discussion on Brexit, particularly with the European Council meeting coming up this week, rather than just a Cabinet sub-committee.  We will have another full Cabinet meeting tomorrow to deal with the Finance Bill.  As Deputies will probably see, between last Friday and Wednesday of this week, we will have had three Cabinet meetings, which is reflective of the different approach I am taking as Taoiseach, which is to have the full Cabinet meet more frequently and for longer periods of time in order that we can have genuine collective responsibility, whereby all Cabinet members will be across the big decisions being made.  It will be the total reverse of what happened during a previous Government, of which I was a member, when a sub-committee called the Economic Management Council made lots of decisions and informed the rest of the Cabinet of them.  That is something I never favoured and was never part of.  It is not the way I propose to lead a Government.<\/p>  <p>  Separate to the Cabinet committee on Brexit, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and I also meet regularly to discuss European affairs and European policy.  Actually holding a Cabinet sub-committee which we can all attend is very difficult.  For example, today the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, are at the General Affairs Council and the Foreign Affairs Council; therefore, it would be impossible for us to have a Cabinet sub-committee meeting today.  On Thursday and Friday the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and I will be at the European Council and it would not be possible for us to attend a meeting.  Whereas Deputy Mary Lou McDonald may suggest Cabinet committees should meet all the time, in practical reality that is not achievable because we are all coming and going all of the time because of the nature of our jobs.  That is why I want to centre more things around the Cabinet and the bilateral and trilateral meetings involving the key Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  On contingency planning, it is appropriate for any Government in office to plan for worst-case scenarios.  Some years ago we had a plan for what we would do if the euro fell apart; of course, therefore, Governments have to engage in contingency planning.

Perhaps RT&Eacute; misreported what had happened at the Ard-Fheis, but I distinctly read an article about a motion being passed calling for an electronic border with gantries and M50 style tolls.

I have been very serious and constructive about Brexit.  The Taoiseach should ask his predecessor, Deputy Enda Kenny, how constructive I have been on Brexit since it was voted for.  I have been serious about wearing the green jersey for Ireland.  Our clear position has always been to have a special economic zone on the island of Ireland to ensure full trade and no border.

It could have informed public debate, not to become a self-fulfilling prophesy but to warn those affected, including those in SMEs in Ireland and Britain, about the horrendous impact of what Brexit will mean for them in their daily lives, economically and in terms of jobs, for example.  It would have been advantageous to public debate.  Lest there be any doubt - it is one thing for Sinn F&eacute;in to try to distort the truth but I suggest it is something different for the Taoiseach to try to do so - our position has been very consistent, from the referendum onwards, in terms of avoiding a hard border in Ireland.  That is why we are putting forward the propositions in all seriousness.  I ask the Taoiseach to acknowledge that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700018#S00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1508252100,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I do not believe an M50-type solution to the Border is a serious proposition at all and I do not believe it demonstrates any kind of political nous or understanding of the job that needs to be done.

As is the case with all Departments, mine has oversight of its work.<\/p>  <p>  On the solution to the Brexit conundrum, I am in broad agreement with what has been said by others.  I believe the only solution that is workable for Britain and Ireland is that the United Kingdom as a whole should remain in some form of customs union.  One could call it a customs partnership if one wanted.  It should be some form of customs union involving the United Kingdom and the European Union.  It is not just about the North and South.  The east-west trade is really important also.  If one talks to anyone involved with an SME, or an exporter involved in agrifood, one will realise the trade between Britain and Ireland is much greater than the trade between the North and South.  We need to bear that in mind.  In my conversations with my colleagues across Europe and on the telephone yesterday with Ms Theresa May, to whom I spoke for 40 minutes, I emphasised my view that the United Kingdom should remain in a customs union with the European Union.  If it wishes to call it something different, because the term \"union\" has particular connotations, it would be the best solution.  It could call it a customs partnership; I do not mind.  If it cannot be achieved, we then need to consider a secondary, less-favourable solution, but that is one that would involve special arrangements for Northern Ireland.  That is what I said to Ms May when we spoke yesterday and what I have said before on many occasions.<\/p>  <p>  Using the term \"special status\" is not helpful.  It is seen by the DUP and other unionist parties as an attempt to diminish the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.  Therefore, using the term actually makes the objective harder to achieve.  This is because of the sensitivities around language.  Deputy Martin, as a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, will know how unbelievably sensitive people in Northern Ireland can be about language, even in regard to whether a word is spelled with a capital letter.  It is not helpful, therefore, to use the term \"special status\".  Unless one is deliberately trying to undermine and to annoy unionists, I ask that one not use it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700018#S01000","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1508252100,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I have not used the term &quot;special status&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700018#S01100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1508252100,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Yes, but the D&aacute;il voted for it.

Can the Taoiseach explain why the top two positions in the strategic communications unit were not appointed in the accepted manner?  The Taoiseach conceded to the House last week that he went to the head of the strategic communications unit in advance to check his availability and that then, technically, the Secretary General of the Department appointed him.

I stand to be corrected but our information is that the person was appointed originally from outside the civil and public service to the Department of the Taoiseach by the Taoiseach's predecessor as part of the European Council Presidency.  Then, subsequently, he was appointed to promote the Action Plan for Jobs.  The Taoiseach might clarify whether that person has ever undertaken a competitive interview to be appointed.  Is that person still deemed to be a political appointment?  Is the person now an established civil servant, as the Taoiseach has claimed?  Can the Taoiseach explain how that progression occurred and how that happened?  Does the Taoiseach think it is acceptable to politicise Civil Service positions in this manner?

In recent years, I have secured significant additional investment in the early years sector, focusing investment on different but critical elements of early years care and education.

In budget 2017, I secured a 35% increase in child care funding, following a similar 35% increase in budget 2016.<\/p>  <p>  There has been an increase of 87% in early years funding since 2015.  Despite this, Ireland will require many years of significant investment in child care to catch up with our OECD counterparts.

These increases reflect my ambition to support the provision of quality child care services with appropriately supported and qualified staff.<\/p>  <p>  The increases in the targeted schemes introduced last month are considerable, up to 50%.  This will significantly decrease the amount of co-payment required of low income families or parents in education or training.

As I understand it, that process is continuing within the context of an overall group that is outside of my control and needs to ensure that proper quality and systems are put in place over a period.  That is an oversight group, as the Deputy is aware.  As I have said before, it is much better to get this right, because it is going to be in place for generations, than to get it wrong.

While potentially the increase could be as high as 150%, I do not expect it to be so, particularly because the Act identifies that, in the context of mandatory reporting, those reporting must have concerns that there is \"significant harm\" to a child, as distinct from the lower threshold that currently applies in the context of voluntary reporting.  Given the raising of the threshold to a concern about \"significant harm\" to a child, it is my expectation that we are covering many children in the context of the voluntary reporting.

It is higher than the extra &euro;37 million allocated in 2017.  I will shortly issue Tusla with its 2018 performance statement in line with the provisions of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 and it will then prepare a business plan for 2018, setting out its proposed main areas of spending.  I have already indicated to it that among my priorities for 2018 will be: actions to support mandatory reporting under Children First from 11 December this year; addressing the gaps in out-of-hours services; and further investment in family resource centres in local communities that deliver services to families, especially in disadvantaged areas across the country.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that the extra funding secured will also allow Tusla to recruit over 300 staff, reduce the number of unallocated cases, improve ICT and advance developments in areas such as domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, adoption, aftercare, and homelessness supports.

While pressure on places was high in some areas, the system successfully accommodated all children for whom a place was sought.  From September 2018, the structure and entry points of ECCE will change as a result of the additional investment that has been made available to fund a full two programme years.  It is estimated that 114,000 children will register for ECCE for the full programme year at that point.  As the system was able to accommodate 120,000 children in 2017, I am confident that there should be no problem accommodating 114,000 children in 2018.

The Department is continuing to work with the Department of Education and Skills and the Central Statistics Office to identify the number of children who are eligible for the free preschool years.  As it did on previous occasions, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will make information available to each of the 30 city and county child care committees on the number of children in each electoral division who are eligible for the ECCE scheme.  This will enable the committees to support providers and parents in their local areas to ensure sufficient capacity exists.  If any future capacity issues are identified, the Department will consider any intervention necessary, such as the provision of capital funding.  I am pleased that the funding I have received in budget 2018 means we can provide for a full second year of the ECCE scheme.

That is implicit in some of the Deputy's comments.  Legally and in keeping with fair procedures, Tusla social workers are obliged to meet directly with a victim to validate a statement and they must then provide the alleged abuser with the allegation and the identity of the victim and invite the alleged abuser to meet them.  One in Four reported that 12 of its clients had made a statement to a Tusla social worker.  As the Deputy states, I acknowledge that this is not easy to do.  In three of the cases Tusla was assessing whether the alleged abuser posed a current risk to children.  One case was founded, while five were unfounded.

These increases reflect the emphasis we are placing on developing a quality service with appropriately supported staff.

I have suggested to the sector that they could apply to the Labour Court for a sectoral employment order, asking the court to make a recommendation on pay for the whole early years sector.  I should also remind Deputies that in addition to the 7% increase achieved in capitation payments, I have also provided &euro;3.5 million towards \"non-contact time\" for all child care providers who register for the enhanced child care measures introduced last month.  This, in addition to the &euro;14.5 million paid to child care services so far in 2017, recognises the administration associated with the ECCE programme and other schemes.

The increase in the capitation rate, for the first time ever, is clearly income that will go to child care providers.  It is there for staff and for other costs, but as the Deputy well knows, the primary cost in the provision of child care is staffing.  The Department have made a significant contribution, in the context of the concerns around pay.  In addition, the extension by up to four months of the free pre-school for many children also increases the income of the provider.

My Department acknowledges that pay and conditions are major issues facing the sector and can lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is somewhat constrained in what it can do in this regard as it is not an employer of child care workers.  However it is of course a major funder of the child care sector.  It is important to note that the most important stakeholders in putting agreed pay structures in place in any sector are recognised employers and employee groups. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that trade unions are active in seeking to achieve a critical mass of representation on the employee side, and I welcome this move.  My Department would also be supportive of any move on the employer side to establish a recognised representative body. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of improving pay and conditions I have suggested to the sector that it might apply to the Labour Court for a sectoral employment order, SEO, asking the court to make a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years sector.  Under an SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders.  While my Department would have no direct role in relation to the SEO process, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, it would be well placed to make a submission to the court once it publishes its notice in relation to the application for a SEO for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, the last three budgets have increased investment in early years by some 87%.  This has helped us to address affordability, access and quality, although I recognise that there is more to be done.  This year's announcement of a 7% increase in ECCE capitation is intended to support the workforce.

We recognise the immense contribution that child care workers are making within Irish society in caring for children.  However, we need to invest more heavily in the child care sector.  We need more investment for the child care workers and for parents who are under immense strain.  child care can cost families anything up to &euro;1,000 a month.  It is a huge extra burden on parents.  We are not in a position to deliver on the affordable child care scheme, as we had hoped.

I understand that.  The two main measures that I put forward this year focussed on quality, hoping that the investment will get to the workers.  In terms of ECCE capitation rates, we used some case studies.  A small service with 11 children with a level 6 practitioner will see its income rise from &euro;26,961 to &euro;28,942.  That is an increase of &euro;1,881 into that service.  An average service with 25 ECCE children with graduate room leaders will see its income rise from &euro;71,250 to &euro;76,237.  That is an increase of &euro;4,987.  Those are just a couple of examples.  I could provide other case studies.

It is already under serious pressure in meeting the demand for child counselling and is relying on voluntary help in order to make that happen.  The additional funding of &euro;10,000 will not be enough.  It would be money very well spent by the State to give funding to centres such as the Taghmon centre to do what it would love to do because it would make such a difference to the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700029#DD01400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1508258700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I cannot agree with the Deputy more in terms of the importance of family resource centres and the ways in which they provide the services that are required by children and families in a manner that is exceptionally efficient and that also truly respects the ways in which communities operate at their best.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the talk of &euro;10,000 in funding, through my budget negotiations I have made available up to &euro;10,000 for every existing family resource centre.

For many years, I have been concerned at Fingal County Council's lack of action in regard to Dunsink Lane and have raised it consistently.  There are approximately 1,000 acres of land in this environ, 300 acres of which is owned by Fingal County Council, 200 acres is part of the old tip head and 150 acres takes in Dunsink Observatory and surrounding lands.  The rest is privately owned.<\/p>  <p>  Fingal County Council is currently conducting an overall study of this area which is included in its development plan.  There is potential to build between 4,500 and 12,000 social and affordable housing units on these lands, depending on density.  One benefit of developing this area is that it is virtually a greenfield site, of which we do not have many, with a number of Traveller-specific accommodation units contained within it which can also be enhanced, delivering a decent quality of life to all in an inclusive way.<\/p>  <p>  The city centre is only 4 km away.  Dunsink Lane also contains vital road links between Finglas and Castleknock.  The new Luas is located nearby at Broombridge.  Dunsink Observatory and Elmfield golf course are currently not accessible from Finglas as a massive concrete block has been placed across the road, something that should never have happened.  This ought to be removed immediately, with a new road built and a new bridge to accommodate it.<\/p>  <p>  Other local amenities and advantages include its proximity to the M50 and to the Royal Canal, allowing the extension of the cycling area.  It would also provide access to the Phoenix Park and the Tolka Valley Park, a beautiful new park, which runs alongside the River Tolka on the other side of where this proposed development would be located.  Blanchardstown shopping centre and industrial parks also border on this area.<\/p>  <p>  It is an area that has been neglected for many years.  It unquestionably has great potential and would make a considerable dent in resolving the housing crisis.  It would also help to alleviate the considerable traffic congestion between Finglas and Cabra and between Castleknock and Finglas.  The blocking-off of that road has been an ongoing problem for many years, and has proved disastrous for the whole area.  Traffic lines up from Broombridge right into Finglas and a similar problem arises on the other side, at the Cabra end.<\/p>  <p>  This proposed project needs resources and a will to deliver them.  There are considerable advantages in doing this.  The land belongs to the local authority, Fingal, and if we ever needed a project capable of delivering large numbers of social and affordable housing units, this is it and this is the place where it can be delivered.  For many of my childhood years, I lived in this lane and played in these fields.<\/p><p>It is a massive place with beautiful surroundings.  It has huge potential and I ask the Minister of State to talk to Fingal County Council to see whether we can get a project and money and see whether it is deliverable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700030#EE01300","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508259900,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ellis.  I am not as familiar as he is with the land around Dunsink, but I know it slightly.  The Government recognises the housing affordability pressures faced by many households, particularly in certain parts of the country.  It is for this reason that the overarching objective of Rebuilding Ireland is to increase the supply of new homes to 25,000 per annum by 2020.  In particular, the aim is to increase the supply of high quality social and affordable homes from State and privately held lands to buy or rent as quickly as possible in areas where demand is greatest.<\/p>  <p>  Critically, &euro;5.35 billion in Exchequer investment has been secured to deliver 47,000 social housing homes through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing over the period to 2021.  This level of national funding to implement Rebuilding Ireland's targets means that funding is available to all local authorities to advance their housing delivery.  This year, 4,500 new social housing homes will be delivered through new builds, acquisitions and refurbishments, and a significant proportion of these will involve new construction.  Taking the Fingal area alone, there are 912 new homes at various stages of the approval process.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to active land management, the Department, working with local authorities and the Housing Agency, has collated details of local authority lands acquired for housing purposes.  To this end, details of 1,700 ha of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published in April on the Rebuilding Ireland housing land map, with the aggregate potential to deliver 42,500 homes nationally.  All local authorities, including Fingal County Council, are preparing strategic development and management plans for their housing lands, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the most potential to deliver housing at scale in the short to medium term.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the site in question at Dunsink Lane is not currently part of the housing land map as it includes the former landfill site, and as such was not acquired by the council for housing purposes.  However, as part of the active land management process, local authorities have been asked to confirm that the data published on the housing land map is fully up to date, and to ensure that any additional sites suitable for housing are included.  This should be an iterative and live process, and as other lands are identified and become available they should be added to the map.<\/p>  <p>  In its county development plan 2017-2023, adopted in March 2017, Fingal County Council recognises the strategic location and development potential of the lands at Dunsink.  However, it also notes significant road, wastewater and other infrastructural constraints that require further detailed investigation so as to inform any future decision to zone the overall Dunsink area for a mixed-use urban area.  The council has committed to carrying out a feasibility study to identify the necessary physical infrastructure required to realise the full development potential of the wider Dunsink lands and the Department will, of course, be happy to engage with the council as it progresses this work.<\/p>  <p>  Last week the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced a second round of the local infrastructure housing activation fund, introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, a number of years ago.  Looking at this for the first time in the past day or so, I see the Dunsink area might be a suitable location for some of this infrastructural funding to be spent.  I also note that Fingal County Council has not yet brought forward additional sites for development of social housing at scale.  However, there is a site at Wellview in Mulhuddart, which is considered to be the most advanced site of scale in Fingal County Council's housing land portfolio as things stand.  The council has flagged that Dunsink is an area of strategic importance for its new development plan, and it is drawing up the strategic plan I mentioned.  The Department is engaging with it in this process.  In fairness to the point made by the Deputy, it is just over four miles from the city centre.  It sounds like an area very suitable for development, but there are a couple of hurdles that the local authority and the Department must overcome first before those decisions can be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700031#FF00200","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1508259900,"counter":372,"content":"<p>What I find very frustrating in all of this is I have been raising this with Fingal County Council for years and we have had study after study.

The Minister of State mentioned Dunsink tip head, but that is 200 acres on the opposite side of the road to where we are speaking about, which is 300 acres.  This is bigger than the Mulhuddart site.  This is a massive amount of land and it is a greenfield area.  It is an area where we would not run into the same problems with lot of residents in terms of trying to get planning.  For many years we have ignored it.  We also have the potential of putting in a lot of projects there, including in the Dunsink tip head area.  We have a horse and pony project.  We have also spoken about having a track for bikes on it.  A raft of amenities can be put in the general area.  The fact this land is available is constantly ignored.  It was acquired a number of years ago through a compulsory purchase order as a result of people settling on the land.  It is there and ready for people to take advantage of it.  We should be saying the infrastructure fund is there and asking the council what it can do and whether it can deliver on this.  Can we speed-up the process and look at these lands?  In one fell swoop we could clear an awful lot of the problems in terms of housing.  The delivery of housing on that site alone would be massive.  We would have, hopefully, social and affordable housing and affordable rents on the site because it is ideal.  They are prime lands with amenities left, right and centre around the area.

I discussed a similar issue with her last week.  It is important that we make progress on these issues.  The length of time that patients wait for adult spinal surgery and orthopaedic surgery is unacceptable.  Each time we raise this issue in the Chamber we are given a commitment that it will be dealt with comprehensively and that waiting lists will be reduced, but since I raised this issue previously the waiting lists have gone in the other direction.  The issues I will deal with specifically relate to Tallaght hospital and the statistics refer to one particular senior surgeon.  The figures are not for a multiple of surgeons, and if they were they would be dramatically worse.  These are accurate statistics for the outpatient list of one particular surgeon working directly with Tallaght hospital.  At present, he has 500 patients on an outpatient list at Tallaght hospital.  Of these, 170 need surgery.  In addition to this, he deals with referrals from a hospital in my constituency, Naas General Hospital, which deals with north Kildare in particular.  He also deals with referrals coming from other hospitals in Dublin and the midlands.  If we were to combine all of these other referrals and the other surgeons, we can appreciate the extent of the list, how long it is and the length of time people wait, which is completely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  When I raised this in October last year and again in May this year, and looked for the required and requested investment, I was given a somewhat positive response that it would happen but, unfortunately, I am raising the matter again this evening because no progress is being made.<\/p><p>We want to acknowledge the management, surgeons and front-line staff in Tallaght hospital, who are working tirelessly with restricted and limited resources to try to deal with this issue.  Its impact on people's lives is very significant, in a negative way.  It is affecting their well-being and mental health.  The pain and suffering they are experiencing is quite extensive, as the Minister of State can appreciate.  It is affecting their ability to deal with everyday life.  It is clearly very difficult and it is impinging on them in a very negative way.  When people are suffering like this, it results not only in trauma for them and their families but it also has a negative effect on their contribution to society generally.  Owing to waiting, they can do only what they are able to do rather than what they want to do.<\/p> <p> Currently, the routine waiting time is 38 months.  If one is on a routine waiting list seeking to go to Tallaght hospital to have adult spinal surgery, the waiting time is 38 months.  The target is from three to six months.  If one's case is urgent, the waiting period is 23 months, and the target is one to two months.  At present, Tallaght hospital is hiring or renting theatre space from the Beacon Clinic for one day per week.  That confirms the lack of resources, theatre space and infrastructure required in Tallaght hospital.  It is an admission that it is not geared up to do what is required.  It does not have the theatre space or necessary infrastructure.  The crux of the problem is that the required facilities are not in place.  I have been asking the Minister for some time to invest in this theatre to deal with the waiting lists and get them under control.  There is a lack of central funding.  This funding is urgently needed in Tallaght Hospital so these waiting lists can be got under control and so people can have control and regain quality of life, which they certainly do not have at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700031#FF00500","speaker":"1324","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508260500,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for this Topical Issue matter.  Unfortunately the Minister, Deputy Harris, cannot be present so he has asked me to reply.  I will refer to one of the issues he raised in a little while.<\/p>  <p>  Tallaght hospital is part of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, and the hospital is the principal provider of elective orthopaedics in the group.  The hospital's spinal orthopaedic service provides emergency and elective access for a varying degree of acute and degenerative spinal conditions with a tertiary referral base.  No spinal surgery is performed at Naas General Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister acknowledges that waiting times are often unacceptably long and is conscious of the burden that this places on patients and their families.  Reducing waiting times for the longest-waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities.  Consequently, budget 2018 announced a total allocation of &euro;55 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, for 2018.  This allocation more than doubles the 2017 total allocation, which was &euro;20 million.<\/p>  <p>  Early planning for tackling waiting lists in 2018 is key.  This funding will enable the provision of treatment for 18,000 inpatient\/day case patients across a range of specialties, including spinal surgery, and procedures.  The NTPF will work with both public and private hospitals in order to acquire treatment for these patients.  Additional funding of &euro;10 million in 2018 will be dedicated to addressing other waiting lists, including for children in need of scoliosis procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Building on the momentum achieved in 2017, planning for 2018 is ongoing by the HSE and the NTPF.  The organisations will work together to develop a coherent 2018 waiting list action plan.  This approach is to ensure a seamless continuation of this year's work on addressing waiting lists into next year.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that 2017 has seen the HSE and NTPF make inroads into the inpatient-day case waiting lists and they are well on target to have removed 29,000 patients from our waiting lists by the end of October.  To ensure the continuation of this strong focus, additional funding in the region of &euro;10 million has been allocated for the remainder of 2017.  This will fund patient treatment across a range of key specialties and procedures, such as those for hips, knees and cataracts, and also for ear, nose and throat and others.<\/p>  <p>  Outpatient waiting lists remain a challenge, however.  Over 92,000 patients have come off the waiting list so far this year but there remain almost 500,000 patients on the OPD waiting list nationally as of the end of last week.  Outpatient waiting lists do not lend themselves to outsourcing initiatives because the full episode of care would have to be outsourced.  The NTPF has advised, however, that it will seek to commission treatment on a see-and-treat basis, which could be used to assist with the management of OPD waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the significant increase in funding to the NTPF reflects the ongoing commitment of this Government to reducing waiting times for the longest-waiting patients.  Next year will see a continued focus on our longest-waiting patients and overall waiting list numbers, including access to spinal surgery at Tallaght Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question on the number of people being referred by the surgeon in Tallaght Hospital, I do not have any information but I will certainly revert to the Deputy.  I will ask the Minister whether he will consider specifically the case of the 500 on the surgeon's list, 170 of whom need surgery.

What the hospital is seeking is a &euro;4 million investment in providing the theatres, the necessary facilities and infrastructure in Tallaght hospital to allow it deal properly, strategically and in an orderly manner with reducing the waiting lists once and for all.  That is what I sought 12 months ago and in May and July.  That is what I am seeking today.  We need a commitment on that because the lack of funding is the problem.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State talked about the NTPF.  We acknowledge that because putting funding into it in 2017 and increased funding 2018 was part of the confidence and supply agreement.  The reality is that, based on how it is being managed or channelled, it is having zero impact on the waiting lists.  Figures show that people on the routine list must wait 38 months, yet the aspiration is three to six months.  An urgent case - it could be a family member or someone who comes to the Minister of State's own constituency office - must wait 23 months although the target is from one to two months.  This is the crux of the matter.  It needs to be addressed and we need to bring forward proposals to deliver solutions and results so the people who are suffering can receive the treatment they need and get their lives back on track and so they do not have to wait 36 or 38 months for routine surgeries to make them mobile again and let them have some quality of life.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700032#GG00300","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1508260500,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I have taken note of the Deputy's concerns and I will certainly raise them with the Minister.

Just after noon on Friday, the liquidators were appointed to Charleville credit union.  That was a huge shock to the people of Charleville and its hinterland.  We should consider a number of issues in terms of how the liquidator was appointed.  The timing is one such issue.  The notification came in the early afternoon on Friday when many people would have their wages paid into their accounts on Thursday night and pensioners would have had their pensions paid in on Friday.  An entire cohort of people has not been able to access their weekly wages or other funds on the Friday.  The powers that be, in this case the Central Bank, should examine the situation and how the liquidation process was executed.<\/p>  <p>  Charleville credit union had been working extremely hard in recent times to try to get out of a very difficult situation.  The board of the now former credit union was working extremely hard with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank said Charleville credit union was not insolvent.  The situation is very difficult for people in Charleville to swallow given that the credit union was founded many years ago and provided an extensive service to people within the community.  Many business people told me over the weekend how their funds in the credit union have been frozen.  Reference has been made to guaranteed funds but many businesses had to resort to their own resources to keep them going and to provide cash to pay their employees last Friday afternoon.  People were told it would take 21 working days before any moneys would be paid out which means people would be starved of access to money for the next three weeks to a month.  That is simply not acceptable.<\/p>  <p>  We could have a lengthy debate on how we came to the pass that was reached last Friday afternoon and how Charleville credit union was prevented from expanding or trading itself out of the difficulties in which it found itself.  The board and staff of the credit union made significant sacrifices to try to put it in a good place.  The question is where we go from here.  We have no credit union services within the town and hinterland of Charleville.  The credit union had 12,000 members.  Today is 17 October.  What plan is in place?  Are the liquidators now going to wait for 21 days before giving money back to people?  That would starve the community of resources in the shape of their own funds.  As Councillor Ian Doyle said this morning on the radio many small and medium businesses and small traders will be adversely affected and the town of Charleville will be devastated.  Will the Minister of State outline the plans of the Department and the Central Bank to make sure there is a functioning credit union in Charleville in the short term?  I am not talking about the long-term future.<\/p>  <p>  I am a major supporter of the credit union movement and the work it has done in every community, urban and rural, especially in Charleville.  In the run up to the very busy Christmas period if we leave a void in terms of the credit union in Charleville we will force people to resort to moneylenders and all of the negativity that surrounds them.  What are the plans of the Department and the Central Bank to deal with the situation?<\/p>  <p>  There is a meeting in Charleville this evening to allow local people to air their concerns.  People are right to be worried.  If the Minister of State will pardon the pun, we need to see the colour of his money at this stage.  We want to see what is envisaged for Charleville and its environs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700033#HH00200","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1508261100,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I am responding to this issue on behalf of the Minister for Finance who wishes to thank Deputy Moynihan for raising it.  This is primarily a matter for the Central Bank but the Minister is fully aware of the strength of feeling locally about the situation in Charleville credit union and the restoration of credit union services.  In relation to credit unions, the role of the Minister for Finance is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.<\/p><p>The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is the independent regulator for credit unions.  Within his independent regulatory discretion, the registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  Where issues arise within individual credit unions the Central Bank gives them time to implement remedial actions, including potential mergers.  In the case of Charleville credit union the Central Bank has been engaging with it over a number of years seeking remediation of the weaknesses in its financial position.  As the Deputy is aware, Charleville credit union had been exploring a number of different options in recent years and has explored merger discussions which have not been successful.<\/p><p>The view of the Central Bank is that the inability of the credit union to address its reserve position, despite previous receipt of external funding, has resulted in it being necessary to apply for the winding up of the credit union.  As the Central Bank, acting as independent regulator, is closest to the detail of this case it would be difficult for the Minister for Finance to second guess its expert opinion.<\/p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland made an <i>ex parte<\/i>application to the High Court on 13 October 2017.  The High Court approved the appointment of joint provisional liquidators, David O'Connor and Jim Hamilton of BDO, to Charleville credit union.  The Central Bank took this action in order to ensure the protection of members&rsquo; funds.  In presenting its assessment to the court, the Central Bank outlined that it believes all feasible options available to Charleville credit union to raise and maintain its reserves at the levels required by law have been exhausted.  The joint provisional liquidators will oversee the closure and wind-down of the credit union pending a final decision of the court.  The credit union will not reopen and all issues relating to the wind-down of services will be managed by the joint liquidators.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance can advise the Deputy that the deposit guarantee scheme, DGS, has been invoked and that members' savings are covered by the scheme up to &euro;100,000 per member.  Compensation payments will automatically issue by cheque to all duly verified depositors.  The payments will be made as early as possible within the statutory deadline of 20 working days.<\/p><p>The Minister for Finance can further advise that the Central Bank is conscious that there is a demand for the services of a credit union in the local area and will examine what arrangements can be put in place to provide specific credit union services in the Charleville community in the future.  The Central Bank is keen that credit union services are available to the people of Charleville.  In some cases members may currently be able to avail of services in another credit union in the area as the common bond may extend into their locality or through their place of work.<\/p><p>The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in the country and while the roles of the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank in relation to the credit union sector are distinct, they are both working to protect members' savings and maintain the financial stability and well-being of credit unions generally.  The Government is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement into the future.  I will try to ascertain from the Central Bank what specific proposals it has and a timeframe for them in relation to the establishment of new credit union facilities in Charleville.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700033#HH00300","speaker":"1265"},{"type":"speech","time":1508261100,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I know what is in the reply.  We could debate for the entire night why we have come to this position and whether the approach taken was heavy handed, but at this point what people are discussing tonight in Charleville is what is the future of a credit union service in Charleville.  Saying the Government supports the credit union movement will not cut it.  I seek a meeting with the Department of Finance tomorrow and I will also seek a meeting with the Central Bank to discuss how we will fill the void in Charleville, and how we will have a functioning credit union service available to the people there who have supported the credit union since the very start.  Could the Minister of State go back to the Department and the Central Bank?  He accepted that there is a demand for a the services of a credit union in the local area and will examine what arrangements can be put in place.  I would have thought the Central Bank would have examined what arrangements could be put in place to provide credit union services prior to putting the credit union into liquidation.  I accept that there is a commitment that something will be done but that should have been done prior to last Friday.  We need to have a functioning credit union within the Charleville area.<\/p><p>A period of 21 days is not acceptable.  I cannot see why this cannot be done in two, three or four days.  Everything is computerised to the absolute limit and all the facts are available.  People's cash &ndash; their hard-earned money &ndash; is tied up.  People need money to survive in their day-to-day lives.  It is not acceptable to have pensions, salaries or anything else, whether belonging to individuals or small traders, tied up within the liquidators.  I appeal to the Minister of State to give the matter the serious consideration it needs.  To be honest, the people of Charleville and its surrounds deserve better.  They deserve to have their money and to have a functioning credit union.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister of State not to leave a void in respect of other lending services having to come in and deal with the aftermath of this in three, four, five or six months' time.  When will there be a service in place?  When will the cash be delivered back to its rightful owners?

I attended the briefing.  I understand that up to 2,500 workers and pensioners are entitled to a share of the &euro;106 million pension fund, known as Pot B or the Second Scheme, that is currently being wound up.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the scheme raised concerns when they began receiving letters detailing their allocations.  They soon realised that there did not appear to be any rhyme or reason to the method of distribution of funds.  The distribution had been decided without consultation by the trustees, Irish Pensions Trust.<\/p>  <p>  The second Aer Lingus supplementary scheme was in operation from 2007 to 2014.  Aer Lingus paid 4% of pensionable salary on behalf of employees and employees paid 2% in all.  Additionally, the Government provided &euro;34 million from the sale of Aer Lingus.  It is striking to note the decline in the value of the fund by &euro;2 million to 31 March 2016 and the fact that administrative expenses increased by over 100% between 2015 and the wind-up.  When the wind-up was mooted, members believed they would receive their allocated contributions and a fixed percentage of the performance of the scheme, but that has not happened.  There has been a total lack of consultation with members.  The proposed distribution seems erratic, inconsistent with the principles of the scheme and totally unfair on many members.  Deputy Daly gave several examples when she raised the matter with the Taoiseach some days ago.<\/p>  <p>  On behalf of constituents I am calling on the trustees and the regulatory authorities, the Pensions Authority and the Pensions Ombudsman, to investigate the distribution of the second scheme and to explain why no other options were afforded to members, as is usual in many other schemes.  Moreover, I want them to explain the accounting and actuarial basis on which the distribution calculation is based.  I call on the Minster to ensure such an investigation takes place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700034#JJ00700","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1508261700,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I know Deputies Chambers and Darragh O'Brien were keen to be here today.  They would be singing very much from the same hymn sheet as us on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  This is urgent because the wind-up of the financial interest of the scheme is under way.  The scheme was in existence for eight years.  As Deputy Broughan has said, workers paid in an average 6% per head, including the employer contribution.  A further &euro;34 million was put into the kitty beforehand.  The benefits objective was discretionary and there is no requirement for the method that is being used by the trustees now to be implemented.  Moreover, there is no impediment to the trustees changing their minds.<\/p>  <p>  What has really aggrieved people is the unilateral decision making.  It means every group of people involved in the scheme is being affected.  For example, for 394 current pensioners of the scheme, the average weekly benefit comes to 45 cent per week.  The trustees propose to buy annuities for this group of pensioners out of their interests.  However, annuities are exceptionally pricy at the moment.  It would be far better for them to have the purchase of approved retirement funds.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of deferred members, the trustees want to buy pre-retirement bonds, most likely, with one of the big insurance companies.  The trustees have advised that if a member wants to transfer out of the pre-retirement bonds that the trustee has chosen, there will be a fee to opt out.  There has been no discussions whatsoever.<\/p>  <p>  As we discussed last week, there has been incredibly unfair distribution of the financial interest.  People of a similar age who have made similar financial contributions will be subject to major differences in returns.  As I said last week, one class can put in &euro;10,000 and get back &euro;12,000, while another can put in &euro;22,000 and get back &euro;84,000.  There is a method in place, but it is an unfair method.  We urge and hope the Minister and the Department can intervene with the Pensions Authority in respect of these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101700034#JJ00800","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1508261700,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies present and those Deputies absent as well.  I know it is a particularly rife issue in the environs of Aer Lingus and the constituencies that touch it.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to outline that the trustees of any scheme have duties and responsibilities under trust law, other relevant legislation and the Pensions Act 1990, as amended.  The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed.  Consequently, any decisions made by corporate or individual trustees of an occupational pension scheme are governed by the relevant legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Trustees have a basic obligation to carry out their duties in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.  Most important, they are obliged to act in the best interests of all scheme beneficiaries, whether deferred, active or those receiving a pension - this is probably what is most relevant to this case.<\/p>  <p>  An active member who is elected as a trustee has to act in the best interests of all members.  If there is a conflict of interest, then the person's duty as a trustee must take precedence over other interests.  If it is considered that benefits due are not being paid in accordance with the rules of a pension scheme, the member concerned can invoke the dispute resolution process and procedures that the scheme is obliged to operate.  If the member is still dissatisfied, she can bring the complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman or the Pensions Authority.<\/p>  <p>  I trust Deputies appreciate that, in my position, I cannot comment or intervene directly in the pension arrangements applying to a particular scheme.  However, where issues that cause concern relating to a particular scheme are raised with me, as in this case, I can notify the Pensions Authority and ask those responsible to intercede.  I wish to confirm for the Deputies present and absent that the matter relating to this particular scheme has been raised with my Department.  In turn, we have raised it with the Pensions Authority, which has agreed to examine it and come back to us with a report.  The Pensions Authority will assess if there has been a legal breach of obligations and take any necessary action if such a breach has been found.<\/p>  <p>  Although the Pensions Authority is under the aegis of my Department, it regulates pension schemes entirely independently of the Department.  Therefore, I am not in a position to influence or comment on the matter, the process or the length of time it will take.  I can say that when this concern was brought to authority officials last week they were happy to intervene and address the concerns to the trustees.  We await a response.
