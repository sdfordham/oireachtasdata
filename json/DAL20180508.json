In a fitting description, Monica was once described as the woman who saved the conscience of Fine Gael.  In her championing of women's rights and in the care and compassion she showed for people in difficult situations, she inspired many people around the country.  She was a particular inspiration for young women and young men in my party and beyond.<\/p><p>When Monica was first elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in November 1982 she was one of only 14 women Deputies, and at the time that was a record number.  Her courageous example helped to change that for the better, and encouraged many others to enter politics.  Over the following 15 years, Monica served the people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire with great ability, and spoke for people across the country who had been marginalised and excluded.  At a time when it was easier to stay silent, she always spoke her mind and was a fearless campaigner for change.  I think a profile in <i>The<\/i><i>Irish Times <\/i>once captured her best with a headline that read &quot;Propelled by principle&quot;.

She was a very warm and sociable person who easily crossed the partisan party-political divide in this House.  She had many friends across that political divide.  She is an enormous loss to Irish politics and of course a huge loss to the Fine Gael Party.  She was courageous, she was outspoken, she was kind and she was considerate.  She was a progressive voice at a time when that was not always welcome.  She in many respects was ahead of her time, thought outside the box, and always spoke her mind.

She did not really come across like a Fine Gaeler, at least not to me.  I mean that as the highest compliment to her, not that some of the Members opposite are not also lovely.  She was a committed feminist in every respect, a woman's woman and a courageous voice.  Is it not something that just weeks before we go to the polls hoping to remove the eighth amendment, we recall that she was one of very few who stood against it when it was first proposed?

It was an enlightening experience for me.  Monica was, of course, on the social democratic wing of Fine Gael and there was a time when that was an important force behind Fine Gael policy.  It was shaping and forming Ireland at the time.  I remember the period of the debate on the eighth amendment and how strong Monica was on that.  I remember holding a joint meeting with Monica on another social issue in Dublin on a Saturday.  I was very concerned about leaving Wexford on a Saturday and missing my clinics.  I noted how terrible it was that we were missing out on our clinics.  She said \"Clinics on a Saturday?  I meet my constituents for coffee on a Tuesday\".  I told her it was a very civilised way of doing politics.  Everything about Monica was civilised.  She had deep compassion and when she dealt with social injustices she felt them in her heart and one knew that.  She made that crystal clear to all.

She was summing up the understandable anger at how Vicky Phelan was treated, the failure to tell women the truth about their misdiagnoses, forcing a sick woman through the courts and questions regarding the quality of our national cervical cancer screening programme.  It is fair and objective to say that the response of the HSE directorate, the Department and the Minister in the early days compounded the crisis.  Nobody appeared to be in charge and women were justifiably worried, anxious and angry.<\/p><p>Major issues have yet to be resolved.  General practitioners, GPs, have yet to be properly advised, resourced and prepared to respond to the crisis.  The help line has been way behind and has not been effective, as I know from people who contacted me over the weekend.  Thousands of people are awaiting callbacks and, according to some reports we received this morning, some women were more worried after the calls than they were beforehand.  Clearly, it is a rushed initiative that is not properly resourced.  Many promises have been made.  Will every woman who seeks a free smear test, as announced last week, get one?  Is that the correct initial response?  Does the capacity exist to do that?  What criteria have been given to GPs to select and refer women for further smear tests?  Surely, an initiative should be taken to proactively target women who are at higher risk of cervical cancer in an initial look-back exercise.  There could be women walking around today who received false negatives and who actually have abnormalities and pre-cancerous cells.  Some consideration must be given to a look-back programme that would focus on women at high risk.<\/p><p>We welcome the inquiry but, given the role of the Department, it should report back to the Taoiseach's office or to a different Department.  There is precedent for that.  While focusing on an inquiry, we must be conscious of the victims of this scandal, namely, the women whose screenings were misread on a number of occasions.  We must listen to their voices.  I was contacted by one of the 209 women this week.  Her tests were missed on a number of occasions on an annual basis.  She had to have a radical hysterectomy that could have been avoided.  She was not told of this until late last week.  She said, &quot;The impact of finding out that cancerous cells were running around our systems for longer than we thought, in some cases years, due to the missed scans only raises fears of recurrence.&quot;<\/p><p>She does not want her medical team to be scapegoated and has stated:<\/p><blockquote>My medical team are my only security.  Whatever happens in this inquiry, any damage to them will damage me and I refuse to allow any further damage.

He is right that at the forefront of our minds at all times must be our concern and regard for the women who have been affected and also the many others who are not affected but who are understandably concerned because of the fact that confidence in our screening programme has been so diminished.  The Deputy is correct to say that the week gone by has been dreadful for our health service.  We have many problems with our health service that need to be resolved, whether it be people waiting too long to see specialists or to get the treatment they need or whether it be some of the patient safety incidents we have become aware of in recent weeks and those of which we have been aware for a very long time.<\/p>  <p>  We must not forget some wider truths.  In no way would I like to diminish or play down the seriousness of any of the issues we have been talking about in recent weeks but we need to recognise that there are also many good things happening in our health service.  Life expectancy is improving all the time and people are living longer and healthy lives.  This is due, in part, to our health service.  When we ask patients what they think of our health service, 85% say they have a good or very good experience of it.  We know that cancer survival rates are improving all the time.  More people survive cancer than was ever the case previously.  We have better outcomes in so many different areas, whether stroke, heart attack or cystic fibrosis.  We now have nearly 10,000 doctors working in our health service - more than ever before - 1,000 more nurses and student nurses than we had a year ago and 114 primary care centres open, with another eight to open in the year ahead.  This is just to give a small example of the kinds of things happening in our health service every day that are bringing about real improvements for patients and real changes for the better in people's lives.  We do a disservice to the hard-working staff in our health service - all 100,000 of them - if we do not recognise the very good work they all do on a day-to-day basis.  We also do a disservice to patients when we are not measured in how we speak about the health service.  The Deputy has been very measured in the comments he has made to date.<\/p>  <p>  I will pick up on some of the questions the Deputy asked.  He asked about the smear test.  The smear test is available to any woman who is concerned and would like to have a repeat one.  The terms of this have been agreed with both the GPs and the smear takers.  A financial agreement on the fee was made last Friday and the Minister for Health informs me that guidance has been issued to GPs as to how to go about the process.  Obviously, there will be logistical and cost issues in getting the tests done as soon as possible but we will overcome them, and the agreement is in place with the GPs and smear takers.  The clinical review being carried out will give consideration to whether or not a look back would make sense and be appropriate.  Obviously, there are pros and cons to that but it is certainly under consideration.  When it comes to the helpline, I am informed that 11,000 calls have now been logged and 7,678 women have requested callbacks.  All the calls are being answered quite quickly but it does take time to get back to people because generally what is required is a relatively long clinical consultation with a doctor or nurse.  Often these callbacks - these conversations - can, for understandable reasons, take 20, 30 or 40 minutes because women have concerns and questions.  Those questions need to be answered and time needs to be given to women and to patients for that.  So far, 2,686 calls have been returned, but it should be borne in mind that before the call can be returned, a doctor or nurse needs to check records and data quality and needs to assign a call to a health professional.  The initial call is answered and, once the information is collated, a longer callback occurs involving a doctor or nurse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800006#D00400","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525785300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

That is why we have had these panicked, rushed measures that have not been properly thought through.  There are 7,000 women waiting for a callback.  That is an appalling number.  Proper thought did not go into what type of helpline should be established and whether it would be a phoneline or a genuine resource that was resourced as such.  A more primary-care focused response should have been developed.<\/p>  <p>  On the free smear test, presumably there will be a fee for every general practitioner, GP, in respect of every woman who comes back.  However, first of all we are looking to get the quality assurance right and restore confidence in that.  It needs to be thought through.  Women at a higher risk should have been targeted first, working with primary care and their consultants, because there are different categories and some are more high risk than others.  There is an urgent need to focus on that aspect of it.<\/p>  <p>  A redress scheme was announced last week and no one has an idea what it means.  Initially, it gave the impression that everyone whose results were misread would get redress.  During the weekend, there were newspaper reports that it would be for anyone who was not told.

A large number of women who contacted the helpline wanted to have a repeat test and the Minister for Health responded to that by making it available.  The possibility of a look-back is under consideration but that would be based on a smear that may have been taken six months, a year or maybe two years ago or longer.  A more up-to-date test might be the best way to get reassurance for people who want it.<\/p>  <p>  As I told the D&aacute;il last Wednesday, the Government's intention is to establish a redress scheme.  The first thing we must do is establish the facts of the case and we do not yet know all the facts.  There are women for whom open disclosure did not occur.  While the State may not have a legal liability in that regard, in my view it does have a moral liability and consequently we will need to provide redress to women who were not told this important information about their health.  We also will need to look at the various different cases, of which there are approximately 166, of women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer where it subsequently turned out they had been given a false negative smear.  We will need to examine that in some detail because there are different forms of false negative, namely, those within acceptable bounds of normal margin of error and those which should not have been missed.  Part of what we are doing is ensuring that this clinical review is undertaken not just of the 208 women, but of all 1,400 who were part of the cervical screen audit.  <\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday night, the Minister for Health announced that about 1,600 cases that had been notified to the national cancer registry of Ireland had not been notified on to CervicalCheck.  Much work has been done in recent days to go through that.  We can confirm that the vast majority of those 1,600 cases will not need to be part of the audit because, as we suspected at the time, many of those women did not have a smear test or had not had one for a very long period.

Mrs. Teap was twice given incorrect cervical cancer screening results, in 2010 and again in 2013.  Two years later she was diagnosed with stage 2 cervical cancer.  Irene Teap died in July last year.  She was 35 years old with her whole life in front of her.  She has left behind a heartbroken husband, Stephen, and two young children.  Irene died not knowing that she had received two incorrect smear test results.  She died not knowing that she could have benefitted from earlier medical intervention.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that Mr. Teap has spoken with the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, who conveyed his feelings and listened to what Mr. Teap thinks should happen.<\/p><p>He is quoted in today's <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>as saying:<\/p><blockquote>I want Tony O&rsquo;Brien gone and to help get rid of the panic that&rsquo;s out there.

The fact that the Taoiseach continues to back Mr. O'Brien sends a very negative message to the victims of this scandal and the public more generally.  People look on and see the old boys' club that runs this State protected at all costs.  The old boys' club is protected even when the lives of women have been placed in the gravest of jeopardy by its members' catastrophic failures.  Now, despite Mr. O'Brien's gross incompetence and his failures, the political establishment is seen to circle the wagons around him.  Earlier the Taoiseach spoke of the feelings of hard-working staff within the HSE.  The Taoiseach's refusal to hold Mr. O'Brien to account does them the gravest disservice of all.  Telling the women of Ireland not to worry because Mr. O'Brien will soon take his annual leave simply does not cut it.  In fact it is downright insulting.

It is very important that we get a good person to take that job and lead the health service forward.  The Minister for Health indicated again that it is our intention to re-establish a HSE board, one that can hold the organisation to account.  I certainly would welcome the involvement of the Opposition parties in talking to us about how we might structure that board.  I do not believe it should be established in the normal way, whereby we go to the Public Appointments Service and get applicants.

Reports indicated that the scoping inquiry will look at the outsourcing of services and the background to non-disclosure.  However, the grave concern and public alarm about CervicalCheck and the audit testing remains, and we are no closer to the truth.<\/p>  <p>  This day last week, I raised with the Taoiseach a number of serious concerns about the responses then under way, and little has improved on that front since then.  As of yesterday, as the Taoiseach has indicated, there were 11,000 calls, 8,000 people had requested a callback and only 2,686 have received it.  That left 5,000 people still waiting for a callback.  Many people have been referred to their general practitioners, GPs, but GPs are contacting us to tell us that they have not been properly informed as to what to tell them.  What has the Minister told GPs, and what additional resources have they been given?<\/p>  <p>  The key question from a patient safety perspective, however, is whether the cervical cancer screening programme was and is currently within acceptable parameters, both in administering the tests and, as importantly, interpreting the results.  Vicky Phelan's case was that her 2011 screening test was wrongly interpreted.  On proper reading interpretation, she should have been referred for further treatment.  As we understand it, the HSE set out a CervicalCheck clinical audit to examine the screening history of all cases of cervical cancer, including Vicky Phelan's case.  Of the 1,482 cases notified, 442 cases - 29% - were flagged for review of one or more elements.  The most common review was of the smear test due to its known inherent limitations.<\/p>  <p>  Tony O'Brien confirmed last week that in 208 cases the review team's interpretation of the smear result was different from the original reading of it.  Further, he said that the difference in interpretation in those cases would have led to a different clinical escalation in 175 cases or a recommendation for an earlier repeat smear in 33 cases.  The figure of 208 cases out of 1,482 is 14% of the total, or approximately one in seven.  To be clear, that is 14% mistakenly read, not 14% mistakes, due to the inherent limitations of the screening system itself.  <\/p>  <p>  The key question for those women that the Taoiseach is telling to go back and have repeat smear tests if they are concerned and who are due to have normal clinical smears this week is whether this 14% reader error falls within acceptable or normal test standards.  That is the question I am asking the Taoiseach to clarify now for the thousands of women and their families who are fearful about smear tests they have had and concerned about having it repeated.  Is a 14% misreading level an acceptable international standard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800010#H00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525787100,"counter":40,"content":"<p>First, in regard to CervicalCheck, a daily report and update is being provided by CervicalCheck on its website.  That comes out at about 5 p.m. every day.  If the Deputy goes to the CervicalCheck website, he will see it gives detailed guidance for GPs and smear takers as to what is happening and it gives them advice and guidance as to how they should communicate with patients who come to see them.  That has been on the CervicalCheck website now for a number of days.<\/p>  <p>  One of the aspects the inquiry will look into is absolutely that question to ensure and give us assurance that our cervical screening programme is up to international standard in terms of the accuracy, false positives and false negatives, and also to look at the issue of the different laboratories, labs, and whether there is a statistically significant difference in the number of false negatives identified in one lab versus the other labs.  As the Deputy knows, three labs are used, two in Ireland and one in the United States.  It is important once again to put on the record of the House the inherent limitations that exist in cancer screening.  Screening tests are not diagnostic, nor are they designed to be; they are screening tests.<\/p><p>The whole idea or concept behind screening is that a patient is invited to come in long before they have any symptoms of cancer.  By screening, one can pick up many cancers early before they become symptomatic, but one does not pick all of them up.  Even the best test done by the best people will have a proportion of false negatives but those who are picked up early can get treatment earlier, which, of course, improves their outcomes and life expectancy immeasurably.  We know from the Cochrane review, which was the highest level of clinical audit or study across the world, that roughly for every 1,000 women who go for a smear test, 980 can be given the all clear and assured that there are no abnormalities whatsoever, roughly 12 women will have abnormalities detected and can then go for colposcopy, which will prevent them from developing cancer or being diagnosed with cancer at that point, and eight will be false negatives.  It is understood, therefore, that for every 1,000 smear tests, for every 1,000 women who goes through the door of their GP's surgery for a smear test, there will be a false negative in roughly eight out of 1,000 cases.<\/p> <p> False negatives do not necessarily equal incompetence, negligence or failure on the part of the pathologist looking at the slides.  It is understood that this is a limitation of cancer screening.  We must bear in mind that in the clinical audit that was done, what is called retrospection bias would have been understood from day one.  Essentially, when one looks at these slides under a microscope, one is looking at cells dyed with a coloured dye.  One tries to see whether or not there are abnormal cells in the pattern.  When the audit was done and they looked back at the 1,400 or so individual slides, they looked back with a different set of eyes.  They looked back knowing that these women had already been diagnosed with cervical cancer.  When one already knows the outcome and what one is looking for, one is more likely to find it.  All of these things must be teased out in the period ahead both by the scoping inquiry, which started today, and the clinical review, which is being carried by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800010#H00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525787400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach did not really answer the question so I will put it again.

An error that reflects known limitations is a normal error.  The question I am asking relates to missed positives where the actual smear was misread.  We are told the rate is 14%.  For the women who are going to have smear tests today, tomorrow and next day before the scoping exercise is complete, I am asking the Taoiseach whether a 14% misreading is within international norms and, if not, can we do something now to improve it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800011#J00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525787400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I again want to put on the record that we have no evidence that our cervical screening programme is below international standards in any way.  We do not have any reason to believe that our cervical screening programme is any less accurate or is poorer that any cervical screening programme, but it does have limitations.  Let us not forget that in the past ten years, 50,000 women have had lesions identified and because we had a cervical screening programme, those 50,000 women were treated early and many did not go on to develop cancer as a result.  We should not forget that because this is a programme that works and saves lives.  The biggest tragedy that could come out of this would be a significant fall off in the number of women going for smear tests because that will certainly cost lives and in some cases, cost women their fertility if they manage to survive.<\/p>  <p>  It is a fine line.  Discovering the difference between normal error and negligent error will be a fine line.  We are talking about something that was within the limitations of screening compared to something that should not have been missed under any circumstances.  It will not be as simple as just saying black and white.  There will be areas of grey in between and that is part of what the scoping inquiry and the clinical review will have to work out.  I explained earlier what I meant by retrospection bias.

She had two smear tests, one in 2011 and one in 2015.  Both came back as negative from Quest Diagnostics.  A year later in April 2016, Anna was diagnosed with an 8 cm tumour.  Thankfully today she is in remission, but the treatment means she cannot have children, which is a huge blow to her, a woman in her 30s, and her husband.  We cannot adjudicate here as to whether it was excusable not to detect her cervical cancer.  However, why is there an aura of such confidence in smear tests when they are, in fact, so fallible?  Why were women with symptoms like Anna's dismissed by their own GPs when the clear smear test was cited to refute their concerns?<\/p>  <p>  Last week Anna listened as the head of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, told the Joint Committee on Health that every slide is examined by two pairs of eyes.  He was categorical about that.  Last week, at the same committee I asked doctors from CervicalCheck if there is any difference in the results between the three labs, the public lab here in Ireland and the two private outsourced labs, one of which is in the US.  They said \"No\".  Strangely, they did not have the figures to back that up, but those figures have since become available when one went looking on the website.  They reveal that over three years the outsourced labs have consistently lower detection rates, in particular Quest.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the year 2013-14.  I believe the Taoiseach took over as Minister for Health during that year.  In the Coombe, the detection rate for abnormalities logged was 14.1%; for MedLab, it was 12.4%; and for Quest, it was 5.8%.  The following year, the Coombe was 13.07%, MedLab was 11.2% and Quest was 7.8%.  In 2015-16, the Coombe was 11.7%, MedLab was 9.3% and Quest was 8.46%.  I know differences in demographics have been cited, but there would want to be massive differences in demographics to bring about those differences in results.  The detection rate at Quest was nearly half of that of the Coombe, for example.<\/p>  <p>  Why was Quest repeatedly given the contract when it has consistently shown these lower detection rates over these years?  This is particularly true for lower grade abnormalities.  Do Quest and the outsource labs meet the standard in the CervicalCheck quality assurance document of screeners not screening for more than five hours a day?  Do its technicians screen not more than the 12,000 per annum or 50 a day?  Why, based on the tendering document I have seen, are we not meant to give contracts to companies whose directors have been convicted of conspiracy, corruption and bribery and yet everybody knows the history of Quest from the 1990s, making settlements of $40 million in one decade, paying $11 million to the US Government in respect of lies over testing; and paying doctors kickbacks?  Does the truth lie elsewhere in the tendering document that the most economically advantageous tender is the one that has to be accepted?  Would the Taoiseach agree that it is serious cause for concern that for-profit private companies have been handed such a vital part of our women's healthcare?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800012#K00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I am very sorry to hear about Anna and very sorry to hear of her case, which the Deputy has shared with the D&aacute;il.

That is exactly why we have established this inquiry - a scoping inquiry which starts today to be followed by a commission of investigation.<\/p><p>When it comes to any contract such as this, laboratories must be up to standard before getting a contract.<\/p><p>The issue as to which one comes in with the best price or the most economically advantageous price or bid only arises provided those labs are up to standard in terms of the quality of service they can provide, their accuracy and their ISO accreditation.  Therefore, the cost only comes into it after standards are upheld.  Cost is not a factor and if standards are not up to scratch, the laboratory would not even be permitted to make it to the final stage of the tender.<\/p> <p> I am speaking on this as somebody who knows a little about how these things work but it certainly was never the case that any contract was ever run by a Government Minister for approval.  That is not how contracts work and it is not how public procurement works, as the Deputy will be aware.  It is also important to say that detection rates are not the same as error rates and it may well be the case that the batches sent to different labs are not all the same.<\/p> <p> The whole point of establishing this inquiry is to get to the facts.  We want to get to the bottom of this, we want to get to the facts, we want to put things right and we want to restore confidence in our cancer screening.  Therefore, it is a specific term of reference of the scoping inquiry established today to, \"examine the tendering, contracting, operation, conflict of interest arrangements, performance information and performance management, accreditation and quality assurance of contracted cytology laboratory services by CervicalCheck from initiation of the programme\".  That is exactly one of the terms of reference the scoping inquiry will examine not just for recent years, but going all the way back to 2008, to establish whether the suggestions the Deputy has made in the Chamber today stand up to scrutiny and are in line with the facts.<\/p> <p> Again, I would encourage people to give their support to Professor Scally and Dr. Denton in the work they are going to do in the weeks ahead to try to answer those questions for all of us as soon as possible.

The plan is to consult with the Opposition parties on the questions.  I imagine it will be much more straightforward than people expect.  It will be questions about public satisfaction with different Government bodies, for example, and public knowledge and awareness of Government policies and the different programmes run by the Government, to see if there are information deficits in that regard.  I have not been consulted on it so I have not seen a list of questions yet.  As Deputies will appreciate, I have many things on my plate and many other priorities at present, and going through a list of questions for a citizen survey has not been one of them in the past couple of weeks given everything else that is happening.  However, once I have been consulted, it is intended to consult the Opposition parties.<\/p>  <p>  The SCU title still exists and will exist until July.  We are in the transition period at present and the title is still being used.  It is intended that the &euro;2.5 million will be remitted back to the Exchequer, but obviously there is the possibility that there may be overruns in my Department and they would have first call on it.  For example, a number of commissions of investigation are run through my Department and there is a possibility that the money might have to be veered from that budget line to commissions of investigation.  As things stand, however, we expect it will be remitted to the Exchequer.  That means my Department's budget will have fallen significantly this year.  As I mentioned previously, I have fewer advisers than the last two or three taoisigh and spend less in terms of the Department's overall spend.  Obviously, spending in other areas is increasing but not in the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to policy decisions, I take responsibility for all policy decisions I make.  Administrative decisions or decisions made by third parties may be different, but I take absolute responsibility for any policy decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding public input and how public input can guide the work of the communications section of the Department, the intention of the citizen survey is not only to do the things I mentioned already but also to identify where there are information gaps where people are not aware of services the Government provides for them or of Government policies and plans for reform.  However, it is not always necessary to survey citizens in advance.  With Project Ireland 2040, for example, it would have been a waste of money to have carried out a survey before it had been published asking people if they knew about it.  Of course, they would not know about it.  How could one know about something that has not yet been published?  There will be information campaigns, therefore, where we wish to inform people about what is happening, and it is not necessary to survey them to find out that they do not know about something that has not been published.  Obviously, they would not know it.  That is where information campaigns could be Government directed.<\/p>  <p>  Another obvious area is pension reform.  We have produced a detailed action plan for pension reform.  It maps out how we are going to reform the pension system in a number of ways over the coming years.  The centre piece of that is auto enrolment, moving towards a system whereby everybody is enrolled in a pension scheme.  That is very important, particularly for people who work in the private sector.  Two thirds of them have no pension provision other than the State pension.  That is an area where we will have to inform people about what is happening and what is coming down the tracks in terms of pension reform.  It might well make sense at the outset, as part of the citizen survey, to assess to what extent people know about the Government's plans for pension reform, whether they have heard of auto enrolment and so forth.  I would wager that few people have heard of it.  I do not know whether it is necessary to do that as part of the survey, but it is something that could be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800019#R00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1525791600,"counter":140,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800019#R00400"},{"type":"question","time":1525791600,"counter":141,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[18947\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800019#R00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent engagement at the University of Leuven in Belgium on 26 April 2018.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1525791600,"counter":142,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[20060\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800019#R00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his visit to Leuven, Belgium.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1525791600,"counter":143,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[20128\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800019#R00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent visit to the University of Leuven.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I delivered an address on the future of Europe at the Catholic University of Leuven as part of its Wilfried Martens series of lectures.  This is an annual event, with previous speakers including Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, and former German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble.<\/p>  <p>  The event was live-streamed and the text of my speech is available online.  My speech covered the many achievements of the European Union, the benefits for Ireland of EU membership and my thoughts about the future direction of the Union, including the importance of completing the Single Market and digital Single Market and working together to deliver concrete benefits for our citizens. <\/p>  <p>  I also spoke about developments in the negotiations on Brexit.  In my address, I emphasised the need for an ambitious and positive approach to our discussions about the future of Europe, and the importance of maintaining our core EU values and principles, such as respect for human dignity, personal and economic freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights.  I noted that many of the challenges we face - climate change, cyber security, illegal migration, international trade and the regulation of major corporations - cannot be resolved by 28 states coming up with 20 different solutions, and that we need to work together to respond to these challenges effectively.  I also emphasised the importance of our relations with the rest of the world, including Africa and the western Balkans, and noted my intention to participate in the western Balkans summit in Sofia next week.<\/p>  <p>  I stressed the importance of communicating and engaging with our citizens on key issues relating to the future of Europe.  From Ireland's perspective, I outlined our citizens' dialogue, which I launched last November and is being led by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and explained that the intention of this has been to facilitate an open and wide-ranging debate with our citizens, which will help to inform our approach into the future.<\/p>  <p>  On Brexit, I noted the particular issues arising for Ireland and the need to preserve the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including power sharing in Northern Ireland and North-South co-operation.  I noted the commitment to translate into the legal text of the withdrawal agreement the principles and commitments agreed between the EU and the UK last December, including in respect of the Border, and stressed the need to make real and solid progress on this before the June European Council.<\/p>  <p>  After the speech, I attended a reception in the university where I had the opportunity to meet a range of academics and students, including Irish students studying there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800019#R00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I noted a section of the Taoiseach's speech at Leuven.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>The Europe of the future must do four things:1. Continue to do well what it currently does well.<br \/><br \/>2. Focus on the big new challenges facing Europe and its citizens.<br \/><br \/>3. Consider its competencies - not everything has to be done at European level; where appropriate, some things should be left to member states, regions and municipalities.<br \/><br \/>4. Engage citizens more. <\/blockquote><p>Whereas we have a very different analysis of many aspects of the European Union, I believe approaching EU reform and the debate on that reform and change on those four grounds is a sound approach.<\/p><p>As currently framed, however, the debate does not focus on many of the main issues of contention for citizens.  In this time of political flux following Brexit and the other issues of concern with the outlooks of certain states, there is a danger that a very simplistic narrative might be peddled by some that a federal Europe can ameliorate the ills of the European Union.  The first flaw in this argument is that so many recent studies show a consistent majority of citizens in Europe who support not the transfer of further powers to Brussels but, rather, the contrary.  For our part, Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see an EU that is guided by democratic principles and based on the premise that it is by states working together as equals on matters of mutual interest that we can best serve all citizens of the EU.  As witnessed by our extensive efforts on Brexit, we believe that Ireland's place is at the heart of Europe.  However, this does not mean we will ignore failures of the European institutions as they relate to Ireland.  What is required going forward, in line with the sentiment of the Taoiseach's third point, which I read out, is for powers to be left with member states, but not only that: we should interrogate whether some powers might be transferred back to member states.  The European Union needs to begin listening to citizens in a genuine way and to uphold their interests.  We need to move away from a very bureaucratic, centralised model which benefits the few towards a social Europe which reflects the interests of ordinary workers and families.  This is the only way we will address the imbalance of power and the democratic deficit at the heart of the European project.<\/p> <p> In the spirit of the four principles he enunciated, what does the Taoiseach have to say, for example, on the issue of protecting Ireland's position of military neutrality and an independent, progressive foreign policy?  What does he have to say, or what is his starting point, on advancing a debate in respect of social solidarity and equality?  What is his big idea - or the big idea of the Government - in a Brexit scenario and then a post-Brexit scenario, of bridging that very deep democratic deficit that some might argue - and convincingly - was a major trigger and contributing factor to the success of the Tory Brexit campaign?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800019#R00900","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525792200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>It is always fascinating to read the Taoiseach's or anyone else's views.  Having had the chance to look at his speech in Leuven on the future of Europe, I believe there are many questions one could ask.  In general terms - we have had references to this previously during Taoiseach's questions - all of us need the opportunity to talk about the future of Europe.  There is an ongoing debate on the future of Europe.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, is involved in dialogue throughout the country regarding the matter but we do not have any real discussion on it in this House.  The number of significant issues the Taoiseach has tabled merit detailed responses and interactions that would be very useful, including to our own people.  Quite often, we have internal debate on matters of very fundamental importance to people and then end up with a treaty that the people know nothing about.  We ask them to come up to speed in a matter of weeks on issues that may have been discussed over many months and, in some cases, years.  We need that debate.<\/p><p>I wish to ask the Taoiseach specifically about one aspect of his speech on which I would be interested in hearing his views.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>I support calls for the establishment of a common asylum policy and system, to replace the current one which is clearly not working.  A small number of countries are shouldering the responsibility of providing refugees with a fresh start in Europe.<br \/><br \/>All of us can and must do more.<\/blockquote><p>Ireland, along with the UK, opted out of the reception conditions directive, as the Taoiseach knows, and we are semi-detached members of the common European asylum system in many ways.

What role does the Taoiseach see Ireland playing in the new common European asylum system to which he referred?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800020#S00200","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525792200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>The Leuven speech was interesting in that its advance billing to the media as setting out some sort of vision about the future of the European Union was classic hype.  It was a standard recitation of broad generalities and it is disappointing that the Taoiseach did not go into specifics about the major structural discussions currently under way within the Union.  For example, it is disappointing that he failed to endorse President Macron's very specific call for an expanded European Union budget, which has the resources it needs to tackle the issues in respect of which countries are seeking leadership.  A budget of roughly 1% of overall income will remain economically marginal and the importance to reduce important schemes to allow new activity will continue to rise.  The Common Agricultural Policy is under threat because of both the British exit and the pressures on other areas, which will increase.  One of the most effective ways of ensuring the retention of the Common Agricultural Policy funds at current levels is to support an increase in the overall EU contribution.  Given the current concerns about future growth and incomplete euro area reform, countries should speak up for more comprehensive measures.<\/p>  <p>  Tomorrow is Europe Day.

More substantive briefings on major EU matters for pro-EU parties might be warranted, as was the case before.

Something of the order of 90% of people support Irish membership of the European Union and see its benefits for citizens.  That is very encouraging.  One of the silver linings to Brexit has been that more and more Europeans across member states seeing the reality of what leaving the European Union entails perhaps have a better understanding of the benefits of European Union membership, which is to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  I never like to think about these issues in terms of a simple transfer of powers from national capitals to Brussels.  That is a very binary analysis.  Talk about national powers and Brussels is the kind of Eurosceptic language one tends to hear from anti-European British Conservatives and so on.  I do not really think this describes the world in which we live any more.  The truth is that there are many problems and challenges that are beyond any nation state to manage, whether mass migration, climate change or security threats such as cyberattacks.  It is not as if member states could manage these problems effectively on their own.  The only sensible option is for us to do things on a multilateral level, whether through the European Union or, in some cases, through the United Nations.  I never like to see things as a transfer from the nation state to the Union; I see it rather as a question of how we can best solve and manage these problems.  That is how one decides where the competence should lie.  I put the idea in the speech, which is largely my own work - not all speeches are, but many are - and I very much like the idea of competencies being repatriated from member states back to regions and municipalities.  I often remark that one sees in the United States that cities and counties can sometimes do things that member states of the European Union cannot do.<\/p><p>That is because there is a lot of local democracy in the United States.  However, when I try to think of examples of things I would like to see removed from European law and transferred to local authorities or national Government, it is difficult to come up with them.  It makes sense that there are things that are now done at European level that do not need to be and that could be done at a national or administrative level, but if I was asked to name three or five of them, for instance, I would struggle to do so.  Sometimes things such as labelling are suggested, but the whole point of the Single Market is to have consistency across that market.  They are difficult to think of but if Deputies have suggestions for European competencies that could be transferred to member states, I would be interested to hear them.<\/p> <p> On Ireland's position on military neutrality, Ireland is a neutral country.  We will not join NATO or sign up to a mutual defence pact.  The Government fully supports the triple lock so that any military operation in which Ireland takes part will require Government approval, approval of the D&aacute;il and a UN mandate, notwithstanding the restraint that puts on us with China, Russia or perhaps the United States vetoing certain things.  However, there are new global security threats including terrorism, mass migration, cyber crime, human trafficking and modern slavery.  They cannot be dealt with by member states alone.  There must be co-operation, which is one of the reasons we signed up to PESCO.  Ireland is a founding member of PESCO, which will allow us to co-operate more on security where we choose to do so.  I do not think that Ireland will ever be a military power.  We will never buy aircraft carriers or invest taxpayers' money in expensive missile systems.  We have very little to offer by way of military prowess and can offer more to European security through other things we do such as peacekeeping, the participation of our Naval Service in the Mediterranean rescuing migrants and co-operation in other areas, such as cyber attacks.  That is where we see ourselves, rather than in trying to do what France and Germany do and becoming a military power or replicating them in some way, even if it is 2% or 5% of what they do.  We want to do something different and contribute to European security through other mechanisms, some of which I have mentioned.<\/p> <p> I am a very strong supporter of a common foreign policy for the European Union.  We can be much stronger in the world if the EU acts together.  Sometimes it is not possible for us to agree on a common policy.  In those circumstances, each country's policy is independent and remains so.  It is better if we can agree.  We have spent much time discussing this at European Council meetings.  We should not forget that in the world in which we live, Europe is increasingly a union of small states.  Germany, which is the biggest country in the EU, has a population of about 80 million.  I do not think that it is even in the top 20 most populated countries globally and if it is, it is so only barely.  It is far behind the populations of countries such as the Philippines, Pakistan and Vietnam, countries one would not think of which have populations bigger than any country in Europe.  Europe's position, whether in population or the size of its economy relative to the rest of the world, is falling.  Some suggest that by 2050 Europe might make up less than 10% of the world's population or economy.  We should bear in mind that it is a very different world from when these institutions were established in the 1950s and 1960s when the European population and its economies was much greater relative to the rest of the world.  <\/p> <p> On social solidarity and social Europe, my speech in Leuven referred to the Gothenburg proclamation which the Government was involved in drawing up.  I attended Gothenburg with the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, to sign up to that proclamation.  That is about putting fire back into the engine of the idea of a social Europe.  Europe has never just been about economics, but also about raising social standards, employment standards, and having a common labour market.  Due to the crisis of the past ten years, the fire has gone out of the engine of social Europe.  The opportunity exists, now that European economies are strong again, to put fire back into the engine of social Europe, which is something the Government wants to do.  The Gothenburg proclamation gives us a good agenda.  There are issues we can pursue as Europeans, from auto enrolment to ending the pension apartheid that exists between public and private sector workers to things such as family leave.  I wanted to speak about that in Leuven because the social market economy is very much a Christian democratic concept.  Wilfried Martens was one of the great Christian democrats of his time.  The social market economy has often been a part of the centre-right's agenda and it is very different from socialism, which is about state control of the economy and society.  The social market economy, which is a Christian democrat concept, accepts that the market is the best way to produce wealth but that the Government's role must be to contain and manage the market economy so that it delivers social goods -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800020#S00800","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525792800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>We will move to question No. 7.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800021#T00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1525792800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>What about migration?

That is largely their own business, except that it affects us in Ireland in a very real way and it is of increasing concern.

A disorderly British exit may not happen because we have previously seen British governments in all sorts of situations coming close in negotiations and some fudge tends to happen or the can gets kicked down the road.  However, Britain leaving the customs union and the Single Market will damage the Irish economy as well as Britain's own economy.  We have to make the point relentlessly and consistently to the British Prime Minister and British Ministers that what they are doing will have a significant negative impact on the entire island of Ireland, not just the North of Ireland, in terms of our exporters, manufacturers and those who provide services to the British economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800022#U00400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1525793400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I was uncharacteristically pessimistic in my own few comments during the dialogue in Dundalk because I am now becoming quite fearful that the British Government's strategy is to fudge the issue in June and again in October and to hope somehow to fold it into the transition period and that even that will not work.  It is now abundantly clear that the so-called bulletproof, unalterable safety net that is the backstop is undeliverable.  I do not believe that the British Government as currently constructed can actually deliver it.  We have seen it again this week when Boris Johnson basically derided the contents of the Mansion House speech, which was supported by the entirety of the British Cabinet.  How does one negotiate with people who change position so fundamentally?  This was a speech made by Theresa May as Prime Minister with the endorsement of her entire Cabinet which set out that she was looking for a customs partnership arrangement.  That proposal is now being described as crazy by her Foreign Secretary.  These are extremely worrying times for us and we need to be clear about where we are heading.  There are enterprises across the State, including Dublin Port for example, that are currently preparing for the worst option.  That is probably a sound strategy now.<\/p>  <p>  I previously asked the Taoiseach about planning for the worst case.  I understand that significant planning has happened across Departments.  I asked that the Taoiseach brief Opposition parties in that regard.  He might arrange for that briefing to take place, even in confidence.  It is now crystal clear that we need to have these matters resolved by the meeting of the European Council in June in order that we will at least know where we are going to land by October and in order that we will have some sense of confidence that a bilateral deal between the European Union on one side and the United Kingdom on the other will be deliverable and that the understandings we had thrashed out with some difficulty last December will be upheld.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800022#U00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1525793400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>On the proposed customs union partnership, as the Deputies will know that proposal first appeared in documents produced by the British Government last June.  The Prime Minister, Ms May, has continued to put forward that proposal in recent times.  The view of the European Union is that it is not workable in its current form, but that it is perhaps something we could make workable.  The suggestion she is putting forward that a customs union partnership could be developed between the EU and the UK after it leaves is welcome.  I do not think it will be sufficient to avoid a hard border on its own, but it would certainly be much easier to avoid if the United Kingdom continued to have a very close relationship with the European Union when it comes to customs and the goods and merchandise element of the Single Market.  It would certainly make the job a lot easier.<\/p>  <p>  It is no secret that there are different views within the British Government and Cabinet.  Those views have been well aired.  There is also now a divergence between the position of the UK Parliament and the UK Government, given that it has now suffered quite a number of defeats in the House of Lords and that it is now impossible to predict whether there will also be defeats in the House of Commons.  That makes negotiations very difficult but it is our responsibility to work through those difficulties and to ensure a good outcome for Irish people, workers and business.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the backstop or the protocol on Ireland, as I said before we want to see real and meaningful progress by the meeting of the European Council in June.  If we do not have real and meaningful progress on the text of the backstop agreement by that time it is difficult to see how we will be able to come to an agreement by October at all.  As Deputies will know and as has been said before, not only by me but by all of the EU 27, if there is no backstop there will be no agreement and there will be no transition period for the United Kingdom.  Notwithstanding the negative effects a hard Brexit without a transition period would have on the Irish economy, when I said that we would not leave the people of Northern Ireland behind again I meant it.  That is why we are insisting that there cannot be a withdrawal agreement or transition period for the United Kingdom if the backstop does not form part of that agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Indeed, everyone accepts that there must be a backstop in the withdrawal agreement.  The Prime Minister accepts that and Mr. Barnier's task force holds that view, as do all of the EU 27, so we are in a very strong position in that regard.  The negotiating guidelines say that by the June meeting of the European Council progress will be reviewed and obviously decisions will be made at that meeting on the extent to which the progress being made is satisfactory.<\/p><p>The deadline for the withdrawal agreement is and has always been October, with the ratification in the European Parliament and British Parliament happening thereafter to allow it to come into effect before the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in March 2019.<\/p> <p> I agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin that the absence of devolved government and institutions in Northern Ireland is a real problem.  It would make sense to devolve the power for the making of some regulations with regard to goods and services and perhaps regulations concerning agriculture and phytosanitary matters.  Ireland is very much the one island when it comes to agriculture and related issues.  Checks already happen at the ports because of this.  Certainly, if the regulations could be devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive, it would help to resolve some of our problems.  The absence of the institutions does make the situation that little bit harder.<\/p> <p> When it comes to east&ndash;west relations, I want the House to know that, on individual and personal levels, relations are very good between me and the Prime Minister, between the T&aacute;naiste and Mr. David Lidington and between the Minister for Finance and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and of course they are also good at official level.  While relations may be good and while we may be in contact very regularly, the context is a bad one.  That context is formed by the decision of the British people to leave the European Union, creating enormous problems for themselves, us and everyone else.  There is also an impasse in Northern Ireland.  While relations are close and while there is regular contact, the context in which we are operating is perhaps as bad is it has been for many decades.<\/p> <p> With regard to further plans for Northern Ireland to try to get the Executive and Assembly back up and running, the Irish Government has proposed a joint initiative by the two Governments &mdash; our Government and the UK Government &mdash; to work together and perhaps produce a joint paper and use it as the basis to encourage the two main parties, namely the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, to come together to form an executive.  As things stand, we do not have agreement from the British Government to do that.  We are not giving up, however.  We will continue to persist until we have the Assembly meeting and the institutions operating as they should be.<\/p> <p> With regard to briefings on EU affairs and Brexit, there is an open invitation.  If any party leader wants a briefing on Brexit preparations or the EU negotiations on a confidential basis, the offer exists.  All he or she has to do is get his or her office to contact mine and we will arrange for him or her to be briefed at the highest level on Brexit plans and the negotiations.  Obviously, the briefing would be in confidence.  People understand that there are things we can say in confidential briefings that we cannot say in a public forum such as this.  Certainly, however, the offer exists.  Should any party leader want to contact my office, we could set up a meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800022#U00600","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issues Matters","time":1525794000,"counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800023#V00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1525794000,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputies Michael Harty, Joan Collins, Mary Butler and Frank O'Rourke &ndash;

I have approved 30 infrastructure projects under the fund at a cost of around &euro;195 million, with an associated housing delivery of 20,000 units by 2021, and more will follow as the sites are fully built out.<\/p>  <p>  The total LIHAF funds drawn down in 2017 amounted to &euro;1.6 million.  My Department is currently examining draw-down requests for the first quarter of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The low level of draw-down reflects the stages that the infrastructure projects were at.  Most were in the design, planning and tendering phases, where costs are lower than at construction stage.  I therefore expect a major increase in draw-down as local authorities move projects to construction.<\/p>  <p>  While there was under-expenditure in 2017, funding for LIHAF is ring-fenced within the overall multi-annual housing budget.  The LIHAF under-expenditure in 2017 was diverted to other housing activities, ensuring that the funding available was fully applied to housing priorities.  The under-expenditure will be made good as projects are advanced in 2018 and 2019.<\/p>  <p>  LIHAF-associated housing will start coming on stream as we progress the infrastructure.  Some sites will deliver housing in tandem with the infrastructure but other sites will require the infrastructure to be in place to allow proper access.<\/p>  <p>  While I am anxious for the infrastructure and the housing to be delivered as fast as possible, I recognise that local authorities must observe proper design, planning and tendering procedures.

The objective of LIHAF was to unblock key pieces of land for housing delivery.  The majority of the projects, if not all, were approved only in quarters 3 and 4 of last year.  The intention is for the infrastructure to be delivered between now and 2019 and for 20,000 houses to be delivered between now and 2021.  At certain sites, however, the houses will be delivered in tandem with the infrastructure.  We are already seeing progress on some key sites in Dublin where there will be housing delivery.<\/p>  <p>  When we talk about what will be delivered under the 30 projects and about the target of 20,000 homes by 2021, we should note that 5,600 homes, or over 28%, will be social or affordable housing.  That means 3,274 social homes and 2,350 affordable homes.  Five thousand six hundred, or 28%, will have a LIHAF-related cost reduction, which was part of the scheme when it was originally set up.  Eight thousand eight hundred homes, or 44%, will be sold at normal market rates.  Therefore, 70% of the projects approved to date are likely to have housing available at &euro;320,000 or less, subject to market inflation.  Bearing in mind the number of first-time buyers and the homes that were bought last year, the figure of &euro;320,000 is important.  In the greater Dublin area, Cork and Galway, 69% of houses bought by first-time buyers in 2017 were priced lower than &euro;320,000.  Outside those areas, the figure was lower than &euro;250,000.  While LIHAF was not specifically an affordability measure in the first instance, it will deliver affordable homes.  More important, it will deliver affordable purchase scheme homes.

My Department currently publishes data on a monthly basis on the number of homeless persons accommodated in emergency accommodation funded and overseen by housing authorities.  These reports are based on data provided by housing authorities, produced through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System, or PASS as it is more commonly known.  The reports are collated on a regional basis. <\/p>  <p>  During the compilation of the March homeless report, in the course of examining data from local authorities, my Department established that a number of local authorities had miscategorised individuals accommodated in houses and apartments, owned or leased by the local authorities, including in some instances people renting in the private rented sector but in receipt of social housing supports, as being in emergency accommodation.  As these issues have not yet been fully addressed, I am not in a position to provide a complete account of the extent of such practices.  My Department is writing to local authorities as part of its continuing examination of the matter.<\/p>  <p>  However, I can say that a total of 247 adults and 331 associated dependants, residing in houses and apartments, were categorised as being in emergency accommodation in the Dublin, south-west, mid-west, north-east and south-east regions.  These categorisations were corrected prior to the publication of the March report.  I flagged the issue that had arisen very clearly when publishing the March figures and was also clear that the figures would have been higher had the corrections I referred to not been made.  We do not yet know the trend month on month, beyond certain indicators such as the rate of presentations of families in Dublin being down almost 50%.  We also know that there are further miscategorisations in the system still to be worked out.<\/p>  <p>  My priority as Minister is to ensure that families and individuals are moved from emergency accommodation, such as hostels, hotels and family hubs, into housing.  I am satisfied that individuals and families who are being accommodated in publicly funded houses or apartments, whether it be social housing or homes leased from the private rented sector, should not be considered as living in emergency accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The issues which have emerged indicate clearly to me that we need improved reporting in this area in order to reflect accurately the numbers of households in emergency accommodation so that we can measure our progress and target our further policies and actions.

What we are seeing, as this is emerging, is a mixed practice in each local authority as to both what they are counting but also some of the provisions they are putting in place to prevent people from going into emergency accommodation.  At the Second Housing Summit at the beginning of year I told the local authorities to be creative in preventing families and individuals from having to access emergency accommodation.  We know the tenuous nature of that with individuals going from day to day, night to night, not knowing where they will be living, and staying in hostels, hubs, hotels and emergency accommodation.  I asked that they keep families and individuals out of emergency accommodation but to be creative with the solutions they put in place.  What we have seen is that some families and individuals have been accommodated in local authority housing, some have been housed in the private rental sector with HAP support, and some have stayed in private rented accommodation which they were renting themselves but they were at risk of homelessness.  The local authority provided supports and therefore they never entered into emergency accommodation and yet because it was section 10 funding, they were counted as being in emergency accommodation but they should not have been.<\/p>  <p>  I was glad to hear Deputy &Oacute; Broin recognise the fact that there has been a miscategorisation error here.  We are trying to get to the bottom of the scale of this.  We do not know exactly when it occurred.  That is why we cannot measure, with any accuracy at the moment, the kind of increase we might have seen from February to March because we do not know exactly when those miscategorisations occurred.  However, we will get that information and when I have it, I will publish it.  We are talking about 247 adults and 331 dependants who have already been taken out of the figures, but I am aware there may be as many as 200 more.  The Deputy might have heard me say in the region of 600 to 800.  We are trying to work through that currently.<\/p>  <p>  By the way, no one was removed by me from these figures.  This was an agreement between my officials and the local authorities once we discovered that people were in homes with their own keys and front door, some for as long as two years.  They were being counted as being in the same situation as someone who is in a hostel who has to go out and walk the streets every day.  That is not case here.  If we want to help people who are in emergency accommodation or people experiencing this crisis, we need to understand exactly who is there and the reason they are there.  We are counting some people, including people from Tallaght Cross who have not been taken out of the numbers, but if some people are in a situation where they might have been in their own home with their own key and front door for two years, that is not emergency accommodation.  If they are not at risk of going into emergency accommodation, they are not in emergency accommodation.  They are in a home, and it may not be their forever home.  In some instances, the home did become their HAP tenancy but they will not be going into emergency accommodation.  They will be going into a home from a home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800024#W01000","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1525794600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The Minister is changing the definition of emergency accommodation.

The idea that because somebody is left languishing in emergency accommodation for two years the Minister is now saying that they are no longer in emergency accommodation is truly astounding.<\/p>  <p>  All of this stands in marked contrast to the refusal of both the Minister and his predecessor to add into the homeless figures families and individuals who are in emergency accommodation but are not funded by the Minister's Department.  There are two hostels in Dublin, for example, the Morning Star and the Regina Coeli, neither of which is funded by Government and both of which house people in hostel type accommodation.  There are 66 people in the Morning Star Hostel and there are 40 rooms for women and children in Regina Coeli Hostel.<\/p><p>They are not counted in the Minister's figures.

When the Minister finally publishes the data which I seem to have but which he, for some unknown reason, he does not, I think he will be forced into a climb-down..

It is not fair on people in emergency accommodation who are experiencing that crisis in their lives to be described as being in the same situation as those who might be in the private rental sector, who have never gone into emergency accommodation and who are not at risk of having to do so.  If we are to have the right supports and targets to achieve sustainable exits from emergency accommodation, we have to understand exactly who is there and why.  I am not responsible for direct provision or women's refuges.  These are different difficulties that are being experienced depending on where the person has come from in Irish life.

Therefore, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I am happy to outline the actual comparison between social housing delivery in 2017 and the corresponding targets for 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, local authorities will deliver 2,319 new-build homes, approved housing bodies will deliver 1,500 and 590 will be delivered through the Part V mechanism.  This will bring to 4,409 the number of new-build social housing homes to be delivered this year.  That is a 92% increase on the comparable 2,297 new-build homes delivered in 2017, of which 1,014 were by local authorities, 761 by approved housing bodies and 522 through Part V.  This increase reflects the changing composition of the overall social housing programme as we increasingly deliver more and more new builds while acquisitions and the voids programme become less significant delivery streams.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, it appears that the Deputy's analysis excludes homes delivered through long-term leasing in secure tenancies for up to 25 years.  Such homes are very much a real home for the individuals and families that they accommodate and 2,000 such properties are targeted for delivery this year, well over twice the level achieved in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the 4,409 new-build homes and the 2,000 leased homes, 560 void homes will be brought back into stock and 900 new homes will be acquired bringing to 7,869 the number of new social housing homes that will be delivered in 2018.  This is more than 50% higher than the target for 2017 and more than 11% up on the 2017 output.  This is before any account is taken of the housing assistance payment or rental accommodation schemes.

The reason I use the phrase \"real social housing\" is because it was used in the unanimously endorsed report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  The Minister claims to be meeting the committee's recommendation when the figures very clearly show that this is not the case.  My concern is the dramatic increase in the Department's long-term leasing targets from approximately 798 in 2017 to in the region of 2,000 this year.  This is the detriment of the provision of real social houses, namely, units owned, built or bought by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  This means that an over-reliance on the private rental sector, be it via leasing or involving the housing assistance payment or the rental accommodation scheme, will jump from 75% of total so-called social housing delivery last year to 78% this year.  Every time we say that the Government is over-reliant on the private sector, the Minister says this is not true.  However, this year, which is the first full year in which he will be Minister, the actual number of real social houses owned by local authorities or approved housing bodies will be fewer than last year.

He is not comparing like with like.  He includes things such as voids when he wants to and then excludes them when he wants.  This gives a very unfair impression of what is actually happening.  Of course, we are building more units this year.  We spent everything in our capital and current budgets last year.  We were doing so much that I had to get additional money from the Minister for Finance to build more homes and that is what happened.  This year, we again have a dramatic increase in our capital budget that will build more homes - real homes coming into the social housing stock.  These are homes built by local authorities and approved housing bodies and homes delivered through the Part V arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  We will also acquire homes.  That figure is down.  Again, the Deputy looked for it last year and I agreed that we should be acquiring less and building more so we are doing that.  When we do that, the Deputy says our acquisitions target is down.  Of course it is down.  That is the case because we are building more.  The number of voids is also down because we have managed to achieve a huge amount in terms of taking vacant, sometimes derelict, social housing units and bringing them back into use.  As we do more of that, fewer voids will be brought back into use.  However, even when one takes the total sum of what we hope to achieve this year, it is up on last year in terms of real social housing units for people to live in.<\/p>  <p>  We still rely on the housing assistance payment and the rental accommodation scheme because we have not yet built enough social housing units for people on the housing list but as we move to 2020 and 2021 under Rebuilding Ireland, more people will be accommodated in new homes coming into the social housing stock than will be accommodated in the private rental sector.  Our ambition does not end at the end of Rebuilding Ireland.  It follows through into Project Ireland 2040 out to 2027.  Between now and that date, at least 112,000 homes will be built.

It is the credit committee's job to judge the different types of overtime.  The overtime is very clear from someone's employment record.  Applicants are asked to give a lot of information on the form as well.  The credit committee analyses the data and makes the decision, as they do in banks, credit unions and everywhere else.  People are asked to give as much information as they possibly can, make their case and back it up with their employment record and their payslips and so on.  It can be quite clear to judge someone's overtime record from that as well.  Different industries, different jobs and different employment backgrounds can mean different things when it comes to overtime.  That is assessed and judged.  In his meetings with the various agencies, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, made it very clear, when using the scheme, to be clear as possible about this while allowing for the different categories because they can work both ways.  One person might want the overtime included to qualify in the first place and others do not want it included because it puts them over the limit.  It is a question of making the right judgment call here.  The criteria are set down and are implemented as standard across the country.  The credit committee needs to make the judgment based on sound data, which is what they do once the evidence is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800026#Y01000","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Other Questions","time":1525795800,"counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800026#Y01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Regeneration","time":1525795800,"counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800026#Y01200"},{"type":"question","time":1525795800,"counter":223,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[19794\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800026#Y01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to support a regeneration team (details supplied) to utilise public lands at a location for 300 social and public housing units; and if this model will be used as a pilot scheme with a view to extending it to all public lands.","asker":"1306","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","time":1525795800,"counter":224,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[19871\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800026#Y01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the assessment he has made of an estate (details supplied) as a suitable site for the provision of the cost-rental model of public housing; if he has met or will meet the regeneration team for the estate; and if he has studied its proposal for the provision of housing in the area.","asker":"1294","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1525795800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>On 26 April St. Michael's regeneration team in Inchicore launched \"Our Community: A Better Way\".

St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate is one of three significant sites being brought forward by Dublin City Council under its housing land initiative, HLI, the aim of which is to ensure the delivery of mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council functional area.  All three sites under the HLI are identified as strategic development and regeneration areas within the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022.<\/p>  <p>  Mixed-tenure developments are an important policy objective in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness and uphold the principle of sustainable mixed communities where housing needs are not subject to rigid segregation based on income levels.  They also provide an opportunity to see major sites developed more quickly, and integrated into existing communities and areas. <\/p>  <p>  While I have not seen the details of the proposal referred to by the Deputy, I expect to meet those involved next week.  However, I am very familiar with the approach which the city council is taking to the St. Michael&rsquo;s project.  This envisages the potential to yield a minimum of 420 mixed-tenure homes and the elected members of the city council have determined that the homes will be provided on the basis of a 30% social, 20% affordable, and 50% private tenure mix.  The council also agreed the methodology for community consultation, as set out in the feasibility study presented to it via a community consultative forum. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018050800026#Y01600","speaker":"1295"}]
