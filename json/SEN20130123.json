It is important, at a time when we hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, to be given a view of the work being done by our MEPs in the European Parliament.  Such addresses would be appropriate business to schedule in the future on an annual or biannual basis.  People may complain that they do not have much knowledge of what happens in the Houses but the general public surely has very little knowledge of the work MEPs do in Europe.  The Seanad could facilitate greater understanding of that work.<\/p> <p>I welcome that departure.<\/p><p>On the final day here before we rose for Christmas we debated the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012, which was passed, with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  I and several of my colleagues spoke for our party.  It was a detailed debate during which the Minister answered numerous questions and I commend him on the way in which he conducted himself, although I did not agree with many of his points.  I have a major concern, however, because during that debate we discussed at length the self-assessment element of the Bill and how people would assess their own homes.  The Minister said clearly that it would be up to individuals to strike a valuation and if it was reasonable there would be no difficulties.  It was all very helpful.  However, over the course of the recess the Government obviously instructed the Revenue Commissioners to announce to the newspapers that they would strike valuations for the 1.65 million dwellings in the State.  The Government did not announce this to the House and neither did the Minister when the Bill was before the House.  The Revenue Commissioners will write to the Leader, to me and to other colleagues here stating the worth of our houses.  This will be done by the end of March.  I said to the media over Christmas that I could not understand this and would have no faith in the carrying out of detailed valuations of properties of all shapes and sizes across the country between December and March.  More worrying was the fact that the Revenue Commissioners stated it would challenge someone who disagreed - for example, if it valued a house at \u20ac200,000 and the owner said it was worth \u20ac150,000.  Should the Revenue Commissioners find against that valuation, the householder would be subject to fines and penalties.  Not once did the Minister mention that in his address here.  We went through the Bill in detail.  I asked numerous questions of the Minister specifically about valuations, as did my colleagues, yet this was announced in the newspapers.  Obviously the Department of Finance instructed the Revenue Commissioners to get this out over the Christmas period.<\/p><p>Every household in the country will receive a valuation from the Revenue Commissioners by the end of March.  Unless there have been 10,000 new staff appointed about whom I do not know, I ask the Leader what confidence he and the Government have that the Revenue Commissioners will be able to make full and detailed valuations of the 1.65 million dwellings in the State between now and the end of March.  Why did the Minister not mention that point, which is very important, as well as the fact that people could be penalised and extra charges levied on them, during the course of the debate on the property tax?  I am well aware that the Minister for Finance is extremely busy at the moment, and we wish him well in his endeavours.  However, over the next week or two perhaps he or the Minister for State at his Department, Deputy Hayes, could find a half an hour or an hour to clarify why this was not mentioned while the Bill was before this House or the other House, and whether it is correct that if someone submits a valuation that is not identical to that of the Revenue Commissioners he or she will be subject to a challenge by the Revenue Commissioners as well as additional charges and penalties, because that is not what we were told in the week leading up to Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300002#A00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358937000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>As I did not have an opportunity to do so yesterday, I would like to extend my condolences to the family of the late Shane McEntee and to our colleague, Senator Clune, on the sad loss of her mother.<\/p><p>On another note, I compliment the Leader and the staff of the Seanad on the excellent hearings held in this Chamber in the first week of January by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, which were well attended by Members of the Oireachtas and members of the public and were well reported.  It was a really good use of the Seanad Chamber, as I am sure my colleagues will agree.<\/p><p>Yesterday, many of my colleagues spoke of the need for a sentencing policy in light of the largely suspended sentence handed down in the case of Patrick O'Brien from Bray two days ago.  I join in the call for that debate and ask that it be broadened to include the general treatment of sex offence cases within the criminal justice system.  Over the past year there have been several worrying cases in which sentences appeared to be somewhat inconsistent and out of line with the normal practice, which is that offenders in serious sex offence cases receive substantial custodial sentences.  It is most worrying if there are disputes between individual sentencing judges and the Court of Criminal Appeal which appear to change the nature of a sentence or to render it somewhat different to the normal run of substantial custodial sentences.  It is important that victims of sexual abuse are not put off reporting abuse because of sentences or because of cases such as this one.  It is important to remember that since 1993 the Director of Public Prosecutions has had the power to appeal unduly lenient sentences, and there have been several high-profile instances in which sentences have been increased on appeal.  That is a very important power.  We need to debate sentencing policy and we need a codifying Act that brings together all the different piecemeal changes that have been made to the law on, and sentences for, sex offences over the years.  The previous Government promised such a Bill and it is in this Government's legislative programme.  We see now an urgency to codify the law on sex offences.<\/p><p>We need also to review our criminal appeal system.  Anyone with any knowledge of the working of the Court of Criminal Appeal knows how unsatisfactory it is that the court is not placed on a permanent footing.  There are frequent changes to judicial personnel on the court and there are long waiting lists before the court hears appeals, particularly appeals against conviction and sentences.  This case highlights several issues and I join with others in expressing my concern about it and in calling for a debate on the broader issue of the trial of sex offences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300003#B00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1358937000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Several times in the past I have expressed my concern about wasting paper and the fact that we should be moving towards a paperless society.  I draw the attention of the House to Jeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for health in Britain, who today will announce an NHS development for making patients' records accessible to the patients.  He reckons that this will save in the region of \u00a35 billion in one year.  Even better, it will save billions of hours of nurses' time because, instead of having to handle all the paperwork, they can retrieve something by touching a few buttons.  Every citizen will be able to access his or her own records.  Apparently in Europe only 4% of citizens can access their own records.  The fact that Britain is moving in this direction is a reminder to us of what we could do if we were able to save even a fraction of that sort of money here.  We are having great difficulty, for example, in deciding whether we can pay for new pharmaceutical techniques and inventions that will save lives, including for people with cystic fibrosis, because we do not have enough money.  We can save that money if we move in this direction, but it needs enthusiasm and a Department of Health that will move in this direction.  It also means that the Government as a whole could do the same.  I have been critical of how slow we have been here to do away with paper and still it comes in.<\/p><p>I was concerned when I read in the newspaper today that there are only three people on the Food Safety Board.  It advertised last March, almost 12 months ago, for other members and received applications but the jobs have not been filled.  Food safety hit the headlines last week.  Apparently, for the board to meet there must be a quorum of four people, yet there have been only three for the past year.  I do not know how the system works but it seems to me there is a real need for the Minister in charge of that body, who I assume is the Minister for Health, to do something about filling the gaps and making sure that happens.<\/p> <p>It seems to take so long.  There is frustration for others looking at what happens in government when they see how long it takes to get things happening, and that is only one example.  I have had my own frustrations with the Construction Contracts Bill, which we passed through the House two years ago and which, hopefully, will become law before Easter this year.  However, it has taken so long and I do not understand why.  I believe there should be two movements: one, to get rid of paper, to move to a paperless society and move into technology and, two, to recognise the importance of time when getting things done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300003#B00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358937600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the matter of the new report published by a cross-Border forum on young men and suicide.

We have among the highest rates of suicide in Europe of which we are aware.  When I was younger we did not know this because it was concealed and it was, socially, a stigma.  It is important that this be brought out in the open and the stigma removed.  I suggest that it would be useful if some Government agency, or perhaps His Excellency, the President, who has had very useful consultations with young people, called together all these groups.  I have discovered in recent years that there are a number of groups dealing with the issue of suicide, including Save Our Sons and Daughters, SOSAD, and Pieta House.<\/p><p>It is possible to detect the early symptoms and indicators of suicidal intentions, many of which I would not have thought of before I consulted with these groups.  They include actions such as giving away a souvenir football, a jumper or a pair of ballet shoes or telephoning friends far away and so on.  At that stage we must intervene or, as a friend, parent or relative, go in and say &quot;Are you troubled?&quot;  If the person is not, then all one gets is a rebuff but one is unlikely to get a rebuff and it would show concern.

I remind the House and the Leader that this year is the centenary of the 1913 Lockout, which was a seminal moment in the struggle for workers' rights in this State and throughout the island.  It is unfortunate and a scandal that in 21st-century Ireland there are still situations in which workers are engaging in sit-in protests to demand basic rights.  Much of the responsibility falls back on the employers, some of whom are unscrupulous and some of whom are walking away from their responsibilities and not paying staff wages or money due.  We have seen this with HMV workers and those at Vita Cortex, Lagan Brick and, in the Leader's constituency, Waterford Crystal as well.  We could all give many examples from recent years and a further example has been given this morning by Senator Gilroy.<\/p><p>We should examine the employment rights legislation.  Part of the problem relates to the issues of redundancy payments, minimum notice pay, unpaid leave and unpaid wages.  All of these are entitlements workers have under the insolvency fund.  The problem is that it takes months for workers to get their wages.  In most cases or in normal circumstances employers would pay the workers and claim the money back, but many employers are walking away from that responsibility and workers are left high and dry and must wait months for their payments.  There is also an anomaly whereby if the company does not officially go into receivership, workers cannot even apply under the insolvency fund.<\/p><p>The are two issues.  First, we should have a debate on employment law because there is also the issue of how the State is treating junior nurses.  There will be a presentation in the audiovisual room today on that issue.  Second, we should find some way to mark the centenary of the Lockout and perhaps invite one of the trade union leaders to address the House this year.

In Denmark the saving made was \u20ac1.8 billion in the management of the health care system.  This measure must be fast-tracked in our health system, in which regard I fully support Senator Feargal Quinn.<\/p><p>The Irish Cancer Society recently published a study indicating that in disadvantaged areas and areas of high unemployment women were 49% more at risk of developing head or neck cancer, while men were 32% more likely to develop lung cancer.  The study highlighted the need for a structured education programme on health care in these areas.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to come to the House to discuss how we can work with the Irish Cancer Society in dealing with this issue.  The Department of Health and the HSE must be proactive in dealing with it.  It is very much an education issue and a question of highlighting the risks people are taking with their lifestyles.   It is worth repeating that the risk for women in these areas of developing certain cancers is 49% higher, while for men, it is 32% higher, a huge difference.  This is an issue that must be tackled immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300005#D00500","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1358938200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I ask the Leader for a debate, as soon as possible, on the report being launched today on suicide, which highlights the fact that the incidence among young people here and in Northern Ireland is directly related to austerity measures and the recession.  The two nations with the biggest increase in the incidence of suicide are Greece and Ireland, where the increase has been very substantial.  While no one doubts that the Government is trying to do its best in the context of national recovery from the recession, it is incumbent on us to remind ourselves regularly in these Houses that things like the promissory note and the payment of \u20ac3.1 billion to the IBRC are on-the-moon stuff for people on the street who are struggling to eat and pay bills.<\/p> <p>I am conscious of the level of coverage of the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 which puts the banks in complete control, but it will be practically useless in delivering for people on the ground.

I have serious concerns about the failure to fill vacancies on the board of the authority.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Health to explain to the House why the vacancies continue.  We are all aware of the need for good scrutiny and standards in food production and food processing.  The food chain has become ever longer and more complex because of the use of technology and, as shown by the recent burger difficulties, the need for scrutiny was never greater.  However, the board to which the Food Safety Authority is answerable does not exist.  This is not a fair or reasonable way for the authority to conduct its business.  I am puzzled by the comments made by Mr. Goodman on testing.  He was reported as stating: &quot;We are talking about DNA testing and DNA will pick up molecules and something in the air,&quot; which suggests there is something wrong with the testing process.  I applaud the work of the Food Safety Authority in this area, but a major problem has arisen at a time when it does not have a board.  Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a function in this regard, but I call for a discussion with the Minister for Health in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300006#E00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1358938800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I support Senator Michael Comiskey in his comments on rural pubs.

Apart from speaking about the issue, as a Government, we have not done anything to address the issue.  In regard to drink driving and the issue of rural isolation, I have witnessed cases of single men who cannot go to the pub and whose best friend is a bottle of brandy or Jameson.

It was filmed on an iPhone and posted on YouTube for the sole purpose of demeaning her.  The fellows abused the girl in this instance.  She was obviously intoxicated.  I am disappointed that I even have to raise the matter because I am giving fuel to the story.

I would like to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport whether the authority has the capacity to carry out this work.  Will this be another case of work of this nature being subcontracted?  Has this system been proof-tested?  Does the authority have all the resources it needs to issue these licences throughout the country, as it will be required to do, in effect, from September of this year?

I have to take issue with what is being done because it is another example of responsibility for a local government function being given to a centralised body even though the existing system was working very well.  When the Minister is brought to the House, I would like him to clarify whether the new system will affect the small amount of additional business that the current system generates for rural pharmacists across the country when local people go into such businesses to have photographs taken for driving licences.  If this is the case, I would like a change to be made to the new system.  Rural pharmacies, like all small businesses in rural Ireland, are doing everything they can to ensure they survive.  My office in Carrick-on-Suir is two doors down from a pharmacy.  Those who go into that pharmacy to get photographs for passports and driving licences provide a major part of its business.

The business will be charged between 25 cent and 35 cent per transaction, with an additional 2 cent per authorisation.  There will be a minimum monthly charge of \u20ac30.  The business has to sign up to a 48-month contract.  That is where there is a big problem.  If the machine is not working in a certain business and is removed, the business has to continue paying for it until the 48-month period has elapsed.  Further fees of 50 cent per cheque and \u20ac4.50 per \u20ac1,000 lodged also have to be paid.  This is having an adverse effect on businesses, especially small businesses.  As the charges mount up, they become quite substantial by the end of the month.  The banks are no longer private entities.  They are owned by the people.  I once said to the Minister for Finance that he is the gaffer with regard to the banks, given that the State owns up to 95% of some of them, but he did not agree with me.  Something should be done about this problem in the interests of job creation.  This issue is of relevance to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in that context.  This is an important issue because now is the best time for those who have business ideas to start up in business.  They have to jump a high wall at the outset.

One of its key findings is that there can be no quick-fix solutions in tackling the extensive and complex causes and risk factors underpinning the statistics for young men because the causes and risk factors are so diverse and intersecting.  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm is a priority for the Government which is taking action, despite what some Members said.  Reach Out, the national strategy for action on the issue of suicide prevention, recognises the youth as a high risk group and outlines a number of specific actions to be taken.  Consequently, the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention has developed a wide range of initiatives aimed specifically at supporting young people who are suicidal and also at supporting their peers in recognising and responding appropriately to signs of emotional distress and suicidal thoughts.  A wide range of awareness and training programmes are available to deal with issues to do with mental health and suicide prevention.  These include SafeTALK to train participants to become more alert to the possibility of suicide in their community and other training programmes such as Reach Out, ASIST, Taking Control, MindOut and STOP Suicide.  The Government is working on a number of aspects, while the Departments of Health and Education and Skills have been working closely with the HSE and the National Office for Suicide Prevention to develop guidelines for mental health promotion and suicide prevention in post-primary schools.  These guidelines which have recently been finalised are based on national and international evidence and best practice and adopt a comprehensive and whole-school approach to mental health and well-being.  It is proposed that they will be launched in the very near future.  When they are introduced, we can perhaps arrange a debate to coincide with their introduction.

I will certainly invite him to the House to discuss the rights of employees and employment law.<\/p><p>Senator Michael Comiskey and several other Senators mentioned the plight of elderly people living in rural areas, the need for further rural transport services and communities to come together to assist the people concerned.  While I cannot condone drink driving under any circumstance, I certainly agree that communities and many publicans throughout the country have provided transport for pub customers.  However, there is a further need for communities to get together to help those who do not have the means of getting to other community activities, given that the pub is not the only outlet for community activities in such areas.<\/p><p>Senator Lorraine Higgins referred to the issue of HMV vouchers.  I am glad that she has acted on behalf of the many people who have such vouchers, including me.  If there is a breach of the criminal code, I am sure it will be highlighted by the Senator.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of savings with specific reference to the waste of paper.  The Senator also mentioned the need for a public education programme though the Irish Cancer Society and the HSE to highlight cancer figures, particularly in disadvantaged areas.<\/p><p>Senator Marc MacSharry called for a debate on the issues of suicide and debt forgiveness.  Senator John Kelly raised the question of the cost of the new cystic fibrosis drug which is one that could be tabled for discussion on the Adjournment in order to obtain the details from the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy spoke about the very serious problem of bullying, particularly cyber bullying.  I am aware of the specific case mentioned by him, which was appalling.  There is definitely a need for proper regulation in this area.<\/p> <p>I will invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to come to the House to address that problem.  We had a previous debate on cyber-abuse but we should have a further debate on it.<\/p><p>Senator Landy raised the issue of road safety.  Other Members mentioned the new licence.  I suggest Senator Landy write to the Minister and I am sure he will get answers to the detailed questions he raised.  If that is not successful, he could table a matter on the Adjournment.<\/p><p>Senator Sheahan raised the issue of bank charges and the fact that they are hindering the setting up of small businesses at a time when we should be incentivising small and medium-sized enterprises to expand.  I will certainly bring the matter and the Senator's comments to the attention of the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300008#G00400","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358940600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>The

recently enacted Transport (C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann and Subsidiary Companies Borrowings) Act 2012, and I thank the House for its co-operation on that.  I must hold some sort of record as this is the second Bill I have introduced as a Minister of State that has begun in this House in the space of about two months.  On this occasion, I am introducing the Taxi Regulation Bill 2012, which deals with the requirement to strengthen enforcement of the taxi regulations and, in order to ensure a robust legislative framework for these new enforcement provisions, to replace the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.  We are coming from an era in which there was a <i>laissez-faire<\/i> approach to taxi regulation, which must be ended.  This Bill, along with other measures, will make 2013 a defining year for the taxi sector, which has finally been placed at the top of the political agenda.  As well as the measures I will outline, a series of radical changes will take place in the taxi sector.  There will be an online register of drivers so the State knows what driver is in each car, and consumers will be able to verify this.  The rental sector will be cleaned up and we will have new vehicle standards and increased enforcement.  This Bill is part of a package of measures designed to improve the taxi sector for consumers and drivers alike.<\/p><p>  The programme for Government sets out a commitment to review and update the regulation of taxis to ensure that taxi services are recognised as a key component of the public transport system and to provide for a forum for discussion between the regulatory authorities and taxi providers.  The publication of the Bill is a key step in honouring that commitment.  The genesis of the Bill lies in the recommendations of the taxi regulation review report from 2011, which was endorsed by the Government in January 2012.  The taxi regulation review group, which I chaired, was established following a Government decision in June 2011.  The aim of the review was to allow consumers to have confidence in the taxi system while also ensuring that legitimate and competent operators and drivers can be rewarded fairly by operating under a regulatory framework that is adequately enforced.<\/p><p>  The review group brought together representatives of all of the key stakeholders - dispatch operators, taxi drivers and consumer representative groups, as well as relevant Departments and regulatory and enforcement agencies.  It carried out a wide-ranging review of the sector which included a public consultation process involving an opportunity for written submissions on the review and for oral presentations from key stakeholder groups.  A parallel public consultation was carried out by the National Transport Authority, NTA, on vehicle standards.<\/p><p>  In drawing up its recommended measures, the review group was also assisted by an independent economic analysis carried out by Indecon economic consultants.  The Indecon analysis concluded that there is an oversupply of small public service vehicles, in the range of 13% to 22% of the current fleet.  In Indecon's view, the level of oversupply is influenced by the impact of non-compliant operators in the sector and by the low level of exit from the industry.  The review report indicated that a number of legislative changes would be required to strengthen enforcement and ensure compliance with the taxi regulations.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the measures set out in the Bill strike an appropriate balance between consumer interests and those of the operators in the industry and the need for regulatory bodies to be able to undertake proportionate and effective oversight.  I am confident that the new enforcement provisions of this Bill will be broadly welcomed by the industry and consumers alike.  The Bill represents the most comprehensive review of taxi regulation ever carried out in this State and one that I am proud to champion as Minister of State.  Drivers are suffering from unfair competition from unscrupulous operators while consumers have not felt safe or had confidence in the standards of professionalism in the taxi sector.  This Bill will help to bring about change.<\/p><p>  The new legislation will provide for a much more sophisticated enforcement toolkit.<\/p> <p>The enforcement regime to be adopted in future will be based on a graduated approach to tackling non-compliance, depending on the gravity of the criminal offence or compliance failure.  It will also be designed to speed up the prosecution of offenders and the administration of justice.  The Bill ensures that enforcement and compliance start at the point of entry to the industry.  Under Part 4 the mandatory disqualification of drivers from holding an SPSV licence will ensure that those with convictions or indictment for the most serious violent crimes will be excluded from the industry.  A key recommendation arising from the taxi regulation review was the commencement of the legislative provision for mandatory disqualification.  The provision has been on the Statute Book since 2003, in the Taxi Regulation Act, but has not yet been commenced due to concerns over its proportionality and administration.<\/p><p>The underlying policy principles for the mandatory disqualification provisions are, first, to ensure the welfare and the safety of passengers of small public service vehicle, SPSV, transport services, particularly in situations where a passenger is travelling alone in a taxi and, second, the proportionate application of the mandatory disqualification provision, to avoid any risk of legal challenge, on the basis of the constitutional right to earn a living, with regard to excluding persons from operating in the taxi industry.<\/p><p>The proportionality issue is addressed in the Bill through specifying the most serious of offences in the Schedule, for which conviction on indictment constitutes a demonstration, through their previous criminal actions, of the propensity of the person to harm another person; allowing for a tiered system of disqualification.  This is based on consideration of the seriousness of the offences in the Schedule.  The most serious offences are shown in Part 1 of the Schedule, namely, those which result in disqualification for life from the date of conviction.  With regard to disqualification in the case of the offences listed in Part 2 of the Schedule, there is a tiered system of disqualification periods in the Bill based on the severity of the length of the sentence imposed upon conviction, to which additional years of disqualification are applied.  In less grave cases where a fine only or a suspended prison sentence is imposed, there is a 12 month disqualification period.  In the more serious cases the disqualification period can range from an additional two years where the term of imprisonment imposed is between three and five years, up to the top end of the scale where an additional five years disqualification period applies where the term of imprisonment imposed is more than seven years.<\/p><p>There is an appeal provision under the mandatory disqualification provision which is open to all, allowing the courts to assess, on a case-by-case basis, the suitability of individuals to hold a licence.  In order to be proportionate, the mandatory disqualification provision is applied retrospectively.  A 12 month stay is provided for with regard to licence holders who have convictions prior to enactment of the Bill to allow for those persons to appeal their disqualification to the courts.  In the case of these licence holders, if the appeal is not made within the 12 month period, or if such an appeal fails, the person is disqualified and their licence stands revoked.<\/p><p>Section 27 of the Bill makes it an obligation for licence holders and applicants to notify the licensing authority of their conviction of any offence that falls under the mandatory disqualification provision.  A licence applicant must supply this notification at the time of application.  In the case of a licence holder the notification must be supplied no later than one month from the date of conviction, or in the case of convictions prior to enactment, within one month of enactment of the Bill.  I believe that the provision for mandatory disqualification in the Bill will be a vast improvement in strengthening the existing vetting system carried out by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in its administration of SPSV driver licensing system.<\/p><p>The licensing authority for SPSV licences is the National Transport Authority, NTA, in the case of vehicle licences and An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in the case of driver licences.  The Bill provides for the possibility that the administration role now undertaken by the Garda will pass to the NTA at some point in the future.  However it is envisaged that vetting of applicants and licence holders will remain a Garda function.<\/p><p>More robust licensing and assessment provisions found in Part 2 on SPSV licensing, will give powers to the licensing authority, both the NTA and the Garda, to refuse to grant a licence application or to revoke or suspend a licence, based on an assessment of the suitability of the person to hold a licence, as found in section 10 in the Bill.  This includes consideration of convictions for any offence, in addition to the offences in the Schedule, that have relevance to the assessment of suitability with regard to providing a service to passengers and use of SPSV vehicles.<\/p><p>The licensing authority may also, under section 11 which concerns the revocation or suspension of a licence, decide to revoke or suspend a licence where it is satisfied that the person is no longer a suitable person to hold a licence based on its consideration of whether the person has contravened the taxi regulations or code of practice established or adopted by the NTA under section 18.<\/p><p>Section 13 provides for a system of appeals and representations with regard to decisions of the licensing authority to refuse to grant a licence application or to suspend or revoke a licence, with a final appeal made available through the District Court.<\/p><p>For licence holders, the new demerit scheme under Part 5 of the Bill will deal with recurrent breaches of the taxi regulations.  This scheme is based on the penalty points system for driving licences but there will be no overlap between the operation of the two systems.  Under the SPSV demerit scheme, demerit offences, which constitute breaches of the taxi regulations, are specified in section 30.  The table in section 31, which shows endorsement of demerits, sets out the number of demerits applicable upon payment of a fixed charge or upon conviction for each demerit offence.  The period of endorsement of demerits on an SPSV licence is three years.  Disqualification by reason of demerits is automatic upon obtaining a total number of demerits equal to or exceeding eight, and the disqualification is for a period of three months.  The appropriate date for commencement of a period of disqualification arising under the demerit scheme will be 28 days after notice is given for disqualification, or some further date to be determined in the courts in the case of an appeal against a conviction for a demerit offence that is relevant to the disqualification.<\/p><p>Section 44 provides for fixed payment offences for contravention of the regulations on a range of regulatory matters that can be enforced by the NTA enforcement officers and, in the case of specified offences, also by members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  The level of fee payable for a fixed payment offence will be established by regulations made by the NTA.  In addition, the fixed payment offences are also demerit offences under Part 5 of the Bill.  Therefore, upon a fixed payment or conviction for a fixed payment offence, the specified number of demerits will be endorsed on an SPSV licence.<\/p><p>The on-street enforcement resources of the NTA will in the future be supported by resources obtained under service agreements as provided for under section 46.  Changes made to the provision for authorised persons under the Bill in section 36 will allow for persons under service agreements to carry out all or any of the functions of authorized officers as specified under warrant of appointment from the NTA.<\/p><p>Conduct and compliance at taxi ranks is also dealt with in the Bill.  Section 22 provides for specific offences relating to a breach of the parameters for use of taxi stands that are specified in by-laws made by the local authorities.  For example, there is the offence of standing with a taxi on a part of a public road adjoining a taxi stand when the taxi rank is full.  Section 40, on closed circuit television at taxi ranks, will allow the NTA to use cameras, CCTV or other apparatus to build its evidence base with regard to breaches of the regulations and offences involving SPSVs at taxi stands.<\/p><p>The Bill represents a balance between concern for the quality of service and safety for the passengers in SPSVs, while also setting out the obligations on passengers with regard to SPSV services, under section 25, on the regulation of passengers in SPSVs.  Furthermore, the coherence of the overall regulatory and enforcement framework which is contained in the Bill is simplified and streamlined into three core areas where the NTA has powers to make regulations, SPSV licensing, assessment of licence applications and SPSV operations and standards.  This represents a refinement and streamlining of the previous regulatory powers under sections 34 and 39 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, and provides greater clarity for all those involved in the taxi industry.<\/p><p>The Taxi Regulation Bill is a major improvement on the existing legislative framework.  It is a more precise statement of the powers of the regulator, the principles and process for licensing and assessment, and the operational standards required by licence holders.  This will give clarity to potential new market entrants and to licence holders in the industry, as well as to SPSV passengers in regard to the quality and standard of service they should expect.  The Bill sets out clearly the consequences for applicants and licence holders who fail to meet suitability standards or for contravention of the regulations.  The provisions of the Bill facilitate the development of a greater physical enforcement presence and capability to effectively enforce the taxi regulations.  It will improve the speed of dealing with regulatory breaches through fixed payment offences and the new demerit scheme even before these issues reach the courts.  The new enforcement measures and refinement of the regulatory framework contained in the provisions of this Bill are essential to support the future regulatory regime where only suitable and compliant drivers and operators can benefit within the SPSV industry and in order that passengers can be confident that SPSV services are of a high quality and are safe for travel.<\/p> <p> Following the publication of the Bill and in the light of representations made and further analysis undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and the Garda, I expect to bring forward a small number of amendments on Committee Stage.  These mainly relate to technical and drafting matters.  However, I am considering the possible need to provide for business continuity in the event of the death of a licence holder given that licences will no longer be transferable.  I am also considering an amendment to the Bill to give the necessary powers to the garda\u00ed under the Road Traffic Acts to enforce 11 fixed payment offences which were specified by the Taxi Review Group under Action 21 of the Taxi Regulation Review Report.  This will greatly ameliorate the effective on-street enforcement of the regulations, following on from enactment of the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300009#H01600","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358941800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House and commend him on being, as he said, the first Minister to initiate two items of legislation in the Seanad within as many months.  That is a way of identifying the positive uses of the Seanad.  We can be an important vehicle, if the Minister will pardon the pun, for legislation and if other Ministers took a leaf out of the Minister's book it would help us in a major way.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il supports this Bill which is in line with our party policy.  It is based to a great extent on the progress made under the two previous Fianna F\u00e1il-led Administrations, with support from all sides of the House.  We have the right to introduce amendments on Committee Stage which we may well do.<\/p><p>The Bill is quite detailed.  Its purpose is to put into effect elements of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 which were never commenced or put into operation.  One has to wonder about the reason for the delay in putting those elements into the initial Bill which are only being acted upon now.  I might be leaving myself open to a sucker punch in that regard as Fianna F\u00e1il was in government for most of that time but the Minister might outline if there were any particular difficulties or legal problems or was it the case that the Government simply did not get around to doing it?  It appears that the main elements of this Bill would be universally acceptable to the public and for that reason I would have thought their implementation would have been expedited but that did not happen.<\/p><p>I welcome the strengthening of the commitment to impose a regime that excludes persons convicted of certain categories of offences from being taxi drivers, as would every right-thinking person.  The famous &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme, which accelerated activity on this front to a certain extent, highlighted that up to 6,000 taxi drivers, or one in every seven, had committed a criminal offence.  Some of those offences were significant while others may have been minor but once again we are thankful to the media for a positive exposition of that situation which is very worrying.  <\/p><p>The safety of the general public must be paramount in all our deliberations.  It is very important that a person getting into the back of a taxi would feel they are in safe hands, especially elderly people and, without being sexist, women who are quite vulnerable to attack from rogue taxi drivers, and we have seen a good deal of evidence about that.  I commend the Minister on every attempt he makes to ensure the public can have more confidence in taking taxis and that they would feel safer in them.<\/p><p>The regime of offences will have to be examined in more detail on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I refer to two types of taxi drivers I have encountered and about which the public will be aware.  Taxi driver A is a decent individual who is working hard to provide for his wife and family.  Since the deregulation of taxis in 2000 he has found himself up against much more competition.  He has to work harder and for longer, often unsocial hours in areas and conditions that he would not normally have wished to find himself in but because of the competition he no longer has a choice in the matter.  As a result of those pressures he will be very vulnerable, especially late at night, in terms of people emerging from clubs and other areas under the influence of alcohol or drugs or both.  Anybody who has been listening to Joe Duffy's radio programme in recent days will have heard harrowing experiences from taxi drivers who were being robbed of their fares, beaten up and virtually kidnapped and instructed to drive to out of the way locations where they are beaten again and left in terror of their lives.  We heard from taxi drivers whose vehicles were urinated in or vandalised in many different ways.  Those people are finding it very difficult to get through their shifts.  That taxi driver has nothing to fear from this Bill.  It is unfortunate that the Bill cannot legislate in some way for his protection to allow him ply his trade in safety.<\/p><p>I am aware the review group, under the Minister's chairmanship, did not agree to reintroduce capping.  That is something that will have to be examined again, especially in the economic downturn, because there are so many taxis operating it is virtually a rat race and people are being forced to work in conditions that are not safe.<\/p><p>Taxi driver B is a different individual.  He is the fellow who invariably has a dirty taxi with the radio playing at full blast who is impolite to and shows no respect for his customer.  He often does not know his way around the city.  One of the taxi drivers' own spokespersons stated that one third of the taxi drivers in Dublin do not have a clue where they are going, and every one of us has anecdotal evidence of that.  I related a story in the previous Seanad that on a wet night I wanted to travel from the House to my apartment in Lower Liffey Street, which is just over the Ha'penny Bridge, but the taxi driver had never heard of it.  I told him I would get off at Bachelor's Walk but he had never heard of that either.  Finally, I told him to let me off at O'Connell Bridge and when I saw him going for his satellite navigation system I knew I was in trouble.  He ended up driving up Grafton Street, which is one-way, and was apprehended by the garda\u00ed.  He then tried to charge me \u20ac15 for my troubles.  That particular individual was a foreign national.  There is not a racist bone in my body but there is a perception among the public that there are people driving taxis in Dublin who do not have a word of English and no clue about the city in which they are working.  We all know that the taxi drivers in London must pass rigorous knowledge tests.  Is there such a testing regime in this country?  Is it being operated or is it a scam in that they are getting other people to do it for them?<\/p><p>There are taxi drivers in every city who take advantage of customers, especially foreigners.  We all know the inventive ways they can find to bring one from the airport along circuitous routes and so on.  That is very difficult to legislate for, and I note the Taxi Drivers Association has stated it would be 100% in favour of such individuals being outed and they would not get any support from that association.<\/p><p>The Bill refers to taxi ranks which have been a bugbear of mine for many years.  Taxi stand regulation is long overdue.  In this city alone the first one that comes to my mind is the taxi rank at Upper O'Connell Street opposite the Gresham Hotel.  I have often witnessed potential customers being abused by taxi drivers for approaching what they thought was the head of a queue only to find that the head of the queue is virtually across the street and they have to cross O'Connell Street to get to it.  We have all seen unseemly situations where taxi drivers are shouting at each other using colourful language, especially at that location.  It occurs in Dame Street also which at night is virtually a sea of taxis.  The taxi situation on Dawson Street is also very unsatisfactory.  The Minister's idea of curtailing people joining the queue in an unauthorised fashion is something that I welcome to an extent.  I can sympathise with a taxi driver who is trying to join that queue and where the traffic flow is reasonable one would excuse it but it must be tightened up in general.  I welcome the use of CCTV cameras also.<\/p><p>I want to put an issue to the Minister which he might consider, namely, the introduction of some form of taxi marshal such as those used in airports, railway stations and so on in some of the major cities.  It might help, and they could be funded partly by the taxi drivers themselves because it would be for their benefit and partly by the Taxi Regulator.<\/p> <p>To my mind, a taxi marshal is required at Heuston Station.  At Heuston there is an ideal sheltered waiting area for customers but the taxi drivers park 50 or 100 yards further down from it and expect the customer with suitcases to walk down to them in the rain.  A taxi marshal could use his whistle to bring that to an abrupt end.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that suggestion.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has probably examined the age rule for taxi vehicles which states no taxi should be over ten years old, but it is hard to legislate in respect of certain cars.  I went to the airport in a state-of-the-art ten year old Jaguar.  It was absolutely beautiful, with an all-leather interior.  The driver's story was that he was being forced to trade that car in for a more up-to-date vehicle but as he could not afford to trade up financially, he will buy a five year old car, which will not be as customer friendly as the Jaguar.  I wonder if more flexibility could be exercised in ruling on branded cars, as no matter how old they are, it is a pleasure to travel in them.<\/p><p>In the past the taxi service was confined to the city, whereas in country towns, a service was provided by the hackney driver, whom people would phone at his home and he would come and collect them.  He could not hover around chip shops, pubs and the like.  In most towns, taxi stands are being introduced and the town council in my own town recently introduced a stand in Listowel.  It is probably one of the last towns to get a taxi stand.  What impact will this have on hackney drivers?  Is the hackney car on the way out?  Is it possible to incorporate them in a different type of regime that would compensate them for their years of service and allow them to compete in a fair way?  Traditionally in towns such as Listowel, the hackney driver got the business during the quiet times but during the Listowel Races, the taxis will travel from Tralee, Killarney and other places and take the business from them.  Will the Minister of State comment on the future opportunities for hackney drivers?<\/p><p>Members of the Fianna Fail Party have a quibble on the transfer of the single plate licence within a family.  We will table amendments on Committee Stage.  The review body has not agreed to family transfers and this places the single plate owner at a disadvantage compared to the multiple, who operates on a company basis and the licence can become an asset of the company and therefore it has a transferable value in that respect.  If a person who has a plate were to die suddenly - I welcome the reference to this problem at the tail end of the Minister of State's speech - his wife and family, sons and daughters cannot take over the licence and that is what provided their bread and butter.  I would like the Minister of State to give that scenario some more consideration.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State well and we will return to these points on Committee Stage<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300011#K00200","speaker":"1142","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358942400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his contribution.

This is the second Bill that the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, has brought to the Seanad.  As he stated, he learned about politics in this Chamber and he likes to introduce legislation in this House.<\/p><p>This Bill in entitled Taxi Regulation Bill 2012 and people might question the purpose of such a Bill.  It is not concerned about regulating taxis driving around the streets of any major urban centre but there are too many taxis in Dublin at the weekend.  The taxis are ignoring the taxi ranks and are a danger to the public.  I welcome some parts of the Bill in relation to CCTV.  The Bill will ensure the public will have confidence in the person driving their taxi.  The need for reform is pressing and it has been obvious for some time that the decision by the former Government to deregulate the taxi industry put the industry into mayhem, as did so many of the other reforms it had introduced.  It was a job half done.  It failed to meet the needs of both taxi drivers and the public.<\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan mentioned that he was taking a taxi but the driver did not know the location of O'Connell Bridge.  I think that resulted from the deregulation of the taxi industry, because there was a two-year window in which people were granted a taxi licence without having done the knowledge test.  I believe the knowledge test that is now in place is very severe and there is a 85% failure rate.  That is a good thing.  <\/p><p>Some years ago, a pub or a taxi licence commanded a good price on the market.  It was a trend some years ago to borrow money to buy a taxi plate as a means of generating an income.  In 2000, with the deregulation of the taxi industry, anybody could have a licence and many people who had invested in a taxi plate lost money.  There was a compensation scheme but as Indecon indicated, there is a 13% to 22% over-supply of taxis in the country.  That does not apply to rural Ireland.<\/p><p>In the course of his address, the Minister of State summed up what the Bill is about.  He stated, &quot;Drivers are suffering from unfair competition from unscrupulous operators while consumers have not felt safe or had confidence in the standards of professionalism in the taxi sector.  This Bill will help to bring about change.&quot;  I think that sums up the Bill.<\/p><p>I commend Deputy Kelly for dealing with this important area.  Public safety must be the first priority.  In this regard I welcome the Bill's provisions regarding mandatory disqualification from holding a licence on conviction for certain offences.  The offences are listed in the Bill and I presume they will be debated on Committee Stage.  There is a provision for the refusal of a licence, having regard to the suitability of a person to hold a licence following convictions for relevant offences or breaches of taxi regulations, and specifically the regulatory offences in the Bill that qualify as a demerit offences, and the specification of the conditions of demerit scheme leading to disqualification for holding a licence.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State clarify when the demerits apply in relation to the taxi licence?  A taxi driver may have a private vehicle.  Do the penalty points awarded to a taxi driver in his or her private vehicle form part of the penalty points of the taxi? <\/p><p>I wish to elaborate on the point made by Senator O'Sullivan on the control of taxi ranks.  The authorised officers will have the ability to inspect and examine the roadworthiness of SPV vehicles.  That is a very welcome move.  We all recall the &quot;Prime Time&quot; investigation into the taxi sector in Ireland which showed very disturbing evidence of inferior vehicles being used as taxis and the alleged abuse of the licensing system.  I can give an example.  I had a four year old car in the 1990s which was rear-ended and was written off by the insurance company.  Within six months it was back on the road as a taxi in Kilkenny.  It is very important that the regulations are implemented.<\/p><p>This is very necessary legislation.  It has been necessary for some time and this area was sorely neglected by the previous Government.  I believe that people are entitled to feel safe and secure in the knowledge that checks and balances are in place to protect their safety when they travel by taxi.  This is crucial for the Government and I welcome the Minister of State's initiative in these areas.<\/p><p>The major stakeholders in the taxi review group would have been the taxi drivers.  In general, taxi drivers have been positive on some of the proposed changes, especially in regard to tighter enforcement to deal with non-compliant operators.  They have concerns regarding the new demerits systems and a worry that the enforcement procedures for non-compliant operators will be too lax.  <\/p><p>Indecon found that in 2008 people took over 100 million trips in taxis.  That has decreased to between 60 million to 70 million trips, in other words there is an over-supply.  There will be a problem if people do not leave the industry because of the lack of employment prospects.  Some people had acquired multiple licence plates and hired them out at the weekends to other operators.  The regulation in relation to this is very hard to enforce.<\/p> <p>Have these people a right to drive with this licence?  I refer to Senator O'Sullivan's point about the authorised officers.  The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has enough to do at the weekends in major urban centres in dealing with breaches of the peace.  I do not mean they should not stop taxis.  I suggest that extra powers be devolved to the NTA and its authorised officers to allow them to stop taxis to ensure the licence is in order and that those driving taxis have the correct documentation.  I suggest the authorised officers be given the power to seize vehicles if the details are not correct.  I question whether some of those driving taxis are tax-compliant and are in possession of a C2 certificate.  For example, what is to stop me hiring a taxi from Senator Ned O'Sullivan by using another name?  <\/p><p>A taxi plate which has not been used for one year will be rendered defunct.  This proposal is welcome because the period of time was previously five years.  The review group stated that the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na increased its enforcement of the Taxi Regulator rules.  However, the garda\u00ed have enough work at the weekends, in my view.<\/p><p>One matter I wish to bring to the Minister of State's attention is taxi services in rural areas.  Dublin and the major urban centres are a very different matter because they have plenty of taxis.  However, the need for taxi services in rural areas was highlighted this week, albeit in a ludicrous suggestion.  I am not making a Kerry joke or having a go at Senator O'Sullivan.  We cannot condone the fact that the county council passed a motion to break the law.  The Minister of State is well acquainted with the issue of rural transport, the provision of Ring a Link buses and services in country areas.  I have highlighted this matter in the House on many occasions.  I ask the Minister of State to consider a scheme for subsidising rural taxis or some form of tax incentive for the operation of such a service.  Isolation is a significant problem in rural areas.  I am not advising that people go out on drinking binges but for many people in rural Ireland the local pub is the only social outlet.  The population may not be sufficient to support a full-time taxi service so I suggest a tax incentive for taxi operators in rural areas.  This is a role for the Government.  The local bus services such as Ring a Link can help rural dwellers to access the local town.  This is particularly the case for older people.  There is also scope for a night service.  While abuse of alcohol is not to be condoned, many people in rural Ireland are moderate drinkers who use the pub as a social hub to meet their neighbours.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The Minister of State lives in a rural part of Ireland, as do I.  I ask the Government to explore the capacity of a rural transport network operating in the evenings.  I ask that such a scheme be begun on a pilot basis.  I acknowledge the important work being done by the Minister of State in consolidating the various strands of transport funded by the Government.  I ask him to consider this proposal in this context.  I welcome this legislation and I wish the Minister of State well in steering the Bill through the Oireachtas.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300012#L00300","speaker":"1125","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358943000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance.  He is championing this legislation which we all support.  It is good to see a significant injection of enthusiasm and energy into that work.  The taxi industry review group, chaired by the Minister of State, should also be thanked for its hard work in this matter.  It could be said that everybody is an expert on the taxi industry because we all use taxis.  We all have both good experiences and some silly or bad experiences of journeys in taxis.  Considering the millions of trips and the thousands of drivers and cars involved, it is a pretty safe industry.  The number of accidents involving taxis is rare although there are cases where passengers have been in danger or have perceived themselves to be in danger.<\/p><p>I wish to pay tribute to the many taxi drivers who have helped me over the years.  I refer to the decent drivers who have gone out of their way to help me.  I remember a taxi driver in Antrim when I got lost in the middle of the night.  He was sitting waiting for business.  I drove up and said that I was completely lost.  He went out of his way to drive for ten minutes to show me the road.  This was quite late at night and I am sure he did not need the hassle of it but he helped me.  That is the kind of attitude we would like this legislation to encourage, that those decent taxi drivers are recognised for the work they do and the often unpaid effort they make, particularly for elderly people in rural areas.  They become more than taxi drivers in that they are of great assistance to elderly people and to young women who are travelling at night.  My own daughter and her friends tell me that when young girls do not have enough money for the fare home they are often helped by taxi drivers.  We do not hear those stories, hearing instead the stories about dangerous situations.  I thank those taxi drivers because some of them have come to the rescue when it was not expected of them. <\/p><p>However, because of the nature of the job there are dangers to taxi drivers - as mentioned by Senator O'Sullivan - as well as to passengers.  The provisions in this Bill ensure the safety of passengers, both personally and in terms of the vehicle's roadworthiness.  Improving standards, administration and enforcement is always a good aim.  This legislation will support and drive these changes.  The mandatory disqualification of drivers with serious criminal offences is a welcome and necessary step.  Retrospective legislation of this kind is not the norm, meaning that people with a serious criminal conviction will be disqualified from driving a taxi.  The Bill will give them the opportunity to go to court to make their case.  The result will be disqualification with licence revoked if the case is lost.  This may reduce the number of taxis in operation.  However the Indecon research indicates an over-supply of taxis.  This Bill is designed to clear out those people who bring taxi drivers into disrepute.  Tighter control of licences is welcome.  I understand that it is proposed to introduce an on-line register of licence-holders complete with driver registration number.  This is a necessary and logical part of tighter regulation.  It means that a passenger in a taxi will be able to check the register on a smart phone.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate when that register will be available.  I ask him to explain whether the register will include the car and car registration number.  This is the most efficient way to clock that something is wrong.  A passenger may not be able to confront the driver but if the car does not match the register this information would be very helpful.  Many local authorities in the UK have this on-line register.  It gives customers direct input into the regulation.<\/p><p>The Bill empowers the National Transport Authority to improve the regulations for the standards and operation of taxis and to set up a code of practice which will give practical guidance and standards for the general behaviour appropriate for drivers and vehicles.  I am particularly pleased to note the new demerit system which will encourage drivers to behave better in many different ways.  Eight demerits will result in a three-month ban.  A ban on driving will concentrate the mind more than will a fine.  A driver cannot earn if he or she is banned.  Three complaints from members of the public about a driver taking the long route home or, as Senator O'Sullivan said, the wrong route home, will result in the driver having to re-sit the knowledge test.  As Senator O'Neill said, the failure rate is quite high.  If members of the public are confident that they can complain about the service, hopefully on line, this will be a way of improving the service.  We have all encountered taxi drivers who are taking a chance, who do not know where they are going.  It can be very annoying when they will not take directions and it costs the customer money.<\/p><p>I am curious to know how rigorous is the knowledge test.<\/p> <p>Clearly, that there are drivers who do not know where they are going indicates that the test may need to be tightened up.  I am aware of the famous test of \"the Knowledge\" for London cab drivers.  It sometimes takes 34 attempts to pass it.  That demonstrates quite a high failure rate, bearing in mind that London is obviously an enormous city.  I am not suggesting Clonmel, Sligo and Mullingar require a knowledge test that might take 34 attempts to pass but that our test may need to be a little more rigorous.<\/p><p>The level of competence for the skills development certificate should be kept under review at all times so that drivers will not be under-tested.  There is a danger of putting a regime in place and then believing it will always be fit for purpose, but traffic trends change all the time and new roads are opened.  Therefore, the competence requirements should be kept under scrutiny.  I understand the MOT in the United Kingdom is ten times more strict for taxis than other vehicles.  I do not know how much more rigorous our testing regime is for taxis.  Perhaps we could consider this.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Minister of State will further our understanding of the service agreements that will be used by the National Transport Authority to make up for the lack of enforcement powers.  I understand from the Bill that this will be allowed; I am just not clear as to what it might mean.<\/p><p>Are the assets that were transferred to the National Transport Authority with the commission available to improve enforcement work?  Enforcement at the time legislation comes into being sends out a signal that we mean what we say.  Legislation should not just be the fine effort of a Minister; it should mean something on the ground.<\/p><p>Like Senator O'Neill, I do not want to pass up the opportunity to mention rural taxis.  We discussed this during Private Members' time last year.  The Minister of State is concerned about this subject but I appreciate that it is difficult to find funding in these times.  He should keep thinking about whether there is a way in which rural taxis could be used to the benefit of those who feel isolated, perhaps twice a week or at a lower cost.<\/p><p>I have a number of queries to which I would be grateful for a response.  This is good legislation and much thought and effort have been put into it.  Can this Bill achieve anything to protect drivers?  Should taxi drivers be subject to a tachograph system of the kind that applies to lorry drivers?  I am sure this was raised by the group.  Would strong branding of taxis encourage or discourage counterfeit taxis?  Could our branding be made stronger?  Are there moves to encourage low-emission or electric taxis, since taxis contribute to pollution?<\/p><p>Is it mandatory for taxi drivers to accept without charge assist dogs accompanying the blind or deaf?  Are there regulations pertaining to the advertising of taxi services?  Under what category do rickshaws fall?  We see them in Dublin, in particular.  Do they need to be regulated given that they clearly use the road?  Unlike bicycles used by couriers, rickshaws seat passengers.  Do they fall under the regulation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300013#M00200","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358943600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I welcome to the Gallery a group of 20 transport economics students from Trinity College, Dublin.

I thank the Minister of State for the manner in which he always receives representations made in the Seanad.  He sets the record, certainly in my time, in that he has commenced in this House two Bills in very rapid succession.<\/p><p>  In the regulation of the sector, quantity licensing must be avoided at all costs.  The Minister of State is trying to achieve quality licensing.  The two must never overlap.  The quantity licensing system led to a vast shortage of taxis, particularly in Dublin.  At least four court judges said taxi licences should not command a scarcity value.  The value of a taxi plate was over &#8364;100,000 in Dublin, and values were also very high in Ennis and Killarney.  People were earning super-normal profits based on a piece of paper whose sole value was based on the fact that the Government would not issue any more pieces of paper.<\/p><p>  There is a mixture of systems in the United Kingdom.  Some do not ban new entrants as a point of principle while others do.  The British Government is strongly encouraging all local authorities that still maintain quantity restrictions to remove them as soon as possible.  Quantity restrictions represent the wrong way to run the industry and the courts overturned the decision thereon.  The authors of the Goodbody report considered the system of restricting licences pertaining to quotas that were 20 years out of date and found that, in the country as a whole, the value of time savings, accounting for the value of time savings the Department of Transport uses to evaluate investments, was &#8364;780 million.  Some &#8364;300 million of this pertained to Dublin.<\/p><p>  Research was also conducted on the public.  Some 96% believed the increase in numbers was good, while approximately 3% disagreed.  Under 1% strongly disagreed.  In a sense, I am echoing the words of Senator Labhr\u00e1s \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, a fellow Tipperaryman, who said yesterday in the House that there should be more optimism.  The review group is far too pessimistic and I will deal with some of the criticism.  What occurred was a great success.  An industry worth &#8364;1.5 billion was built up in a short time and it employed 36,000 people, three quarters of whom would not have been employed in the industry had the sector not been deregulated.  If the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, had 25,000 extra jobs, his PR department would be in ecstasy and float off into the stratosphere.  What occurred was a success and provided a service that consumers wanted and valued.  An industry worth &#8364;1.5 billion is much more important than certain others.  The receipts of Dublin Bus in 2008 amounted to &#8364;200 million and those from the railways amounted to &#8364;190 million.  The receipts of Bus \u00c9ireann were worth &#8364;67 million.  There was growth of 82% in Dublin when the taxi market was opened up.<\/p><p>  I am not sure about the Minister of State's statement that we moved from a <i>laissez-faire<\/i> position.  I heard a speech by Kathleen Doyle, the taxi regulator, at a transport conference in Lisbon in 2010.  She was regulating the sector between 2003 and the present time, and she gave examples to illustrate her points.  On the next Stage, I will bring forward some of the evidence.<\/p><p>  It is too pessimistic to neglect the Goodbody report and all the success to which it pointed.  Has the Department of Transport forgotten the report?  It seems to have amnesia in regard to good news.  I support Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa in trying to get some good news into the House on this issue.  Deregulation was a success in that 4,000 taxis became 21,000.  This provided jobs and services, and &#8364;750 million in time savings.<\/p><p>  There were faults, however.  I looked up the Garda report but could not find any information on faults, as it has no special section on taxis.  I looked up the documentation of the Department of Social Protection, which has investigated the sector.  In its report on achieving compliance, the section on taxis states that one taxi vehicle out of 36,000 was impounded as it was driven by an individual with fake taxi driver documentation and two fake driving licences.  This is according to the Department of Social Protection's fraud initiative.  Let us not get carried away, however, with what the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme indicated while ignoring the positive evidence in the Goodbody report and the findings of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  There are no other quantified statements of crimes or social welfare fraud committed by taxi drivers other than what I have indicated.  The industry has an image that would suggest there is such fraud, but it is not evident in the reports.<\/p><p>  Sometimes the incumbents in an industry that has traditionally been protected try to bad-mouth the new entrants.  That is what has been happening in this State.  They wanted to keep the industry shut so they could sell a licence for &#8364;130,000, or more.  In New York, a medallion sells for $1 million.  This indicates the amount of super-normal profits taxi drivers earn from keeping new entrants out.  Thus, the incumbents will bad-mouth new entrants, although I do not know if there is any evidence as to what they do to the new entrants.  What I have described is a tradition in heavily regulated industries and we must avoid it here.<\/p> <p> There were 377 complaints in the year to December 2012.  I looked up the Ombudsman's report and there were 3,700 complaints about public servants.  Our constituents are ten times more likely to complain to the Ombudsman about abuse by a public servant than they are about a taxi person, so let us get that into perspective.  There were 377 complaints for 75 million journeys.  It is not that great.  A good service is being provided which is appreciated and used by the public.  I wonder if some of the decline in the business is as a result of uninformed comment that this business is unsatisfactory, merits a high level of consumer dissatisfaction, which is not shown in the figures of only 377 complaints, and is carried on by fraudsters, which was not shown up in the Minister for Social Protection's analysis of the industry.  <\/p><p>The courts opened this up from the traditional licensing system for very good reasons but I worry about the attempts to shut it down again in SI 250 of 2010 in which new entrants are forbidden unless they operate wheelchair accessible vehicles.  We have had a recession, and we all regret that.  Taxi numbers are falling, and that is documented.  We cannot say that Aldi and Lidl cannot open here or that we do not want any new industries to open up here because there has been a recession in the economy.  People who are self-employed will experience recessions, and taxi drivers are self-employed.  The assumption that the Parliament and the Minister of State have some duty to protect them unfairly against new entrants and against competition underpins some of this legislation, and I will table amendments to it on Committee Stage.  The quantity aspects should not have been reintroduced by that statutory instrument.  I note the Minister of State is repealing the 2003 Act, and I agree with him and will support the amendment in the Bill.  I think he is having second thoughts on section 13, and I agree with him on that.  However, we cannot have the wish of the House to improve quality become a backdoor method to reintroduce quantity licences which gave us an appalling industry in the past.  It might be better for the regulator and for everybody connected to this to point out that the numbers illustrate a very small level of abuse, complaint and social welfare fraud.  <\/p><p>Another point arises and it would be interesting if constitutional lawyers, like Senator Bacik, had a view.  The Minister of State mentioned on radio this morning that there were 6,000 criminals in the industry.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300014#N00300","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358944200,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I did not say that.

Are we going to turn people into convicts?  Are we going to give them all back to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter?  It is double jeopardy to convict somebody of one offence and say he or she cannot run a taxi either.  If every Minister said there were too many people convicted of criminal offences in an industry, it would result in a huge change to criminal justice in this country.  People who have served their time and paid their fines have rights as well.  I am not so sure where the number comes from but if every Minister carried on like that, we would have a permanent criminal underclass.  That is a danger of some of the reporting of what goes on in this sector.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for initiating the Bill in this House.  I mention the review group which, despite the Minister of State being the chair and Pat Byrne being the deputy chair, was heavily bureaucratic and heavily representative of the incumbents.  In this area of economics, the incumbents will always oppose new entrants.  Aer Lingus did so for years and CIE does it to independent bus companies.  It is well known.

In terms of wheelchair accessible taxis and the comparison with Lidl or Aldi, if Lidl or Aldi open a new store, it must be wheelchair accessible and disability-friendly.  While I concur that new entrants into the taxi business should have accessible cars, it should not be cost punitive.  There should be some sort of a tax rebate scheme for taxi drivers entering the taxi business where they are required to have accessible vehicles.<\/p><p>The taxi industry was deregulated in 2000 when one could not get a taxi for love or money on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night.  I was living in Donnybrook at the time and I remember if one went into the city centre at night and if there was rain or snow, one had to walk home because there were no taxis.  The taxi industry was to blame for Bobby Molloy's decision to deregulate because no agreement proposed by the Government at the time was acceptable to the leaders of the taxi unions.  At one stage, it proposed that it would give a free plate to everyone with a taxi plate in Dublin but that was not agreed to.  The Government made the right decision to deregulate the taxi industry.<\/p><p>That said, deregulation has probably gone too far.  Approximately, six months ago I was out in Dublin on a Saturday night and Dawson Street was littered with taxis at 1 a.m.  We have the other extreme now where taxi drivers are finding it hard to make a living.  What the Minister of State proposes in this legislation is what we assumed was already in existence in the taxi business.  What is he is doing is effectively bringing in a set of common sense proposals to ensure that the business is tidied up.  It is quite shocking that 6,000 PSV licence holders have some form of criminal conviction, granted many of those convictions are for minor offences, such as road traffic offences.  However, a proportion of convictions are possibly for more serious offences.  <\/p><p>When people get into taxis to go home at night, they must have confidence that the person driving them is fit to be behind the wheel of a public service vehicle.  It is reasonable for the public to assume the Government has regulations in place to ensure, where possible, the person behind the wheel of a taxi driving somebody home, who is perhaps in a vulnerable state, is fit to be in that position and it is a disgrace if we cannot stand over that.  However, this legislation will ensure we will be in a position to stand over the people driving taxis.<\/p><p>Probably more than anybody else in this House, I use taxis on a regular basis.  I was in a taxi coming to Leinster House from Heuston Station on Monday evening and the taxi driver said the largest fine for somebody who produces false identification when inspected is \u20ac250.  Thankfully, this legislation will deal comprehensively with that type of scenario.<\/p><p>The taxi business has a very bright future.  We must ensure that the travelling public not only travels in safety but in comfort.  I applaud the Minister of State's initiatives in terms of ensuring vehicles are up to standard and the penalty point-type system proposed in that after a number of offences, a person will lose his or her PSV licence.<\/p> <p>That is a great incentive to ensure that PSV licence holders do the right thing.  It will ensure that they provide the best possible service and in the best possible vehicle.  In this day and age nobody expects to be driven around in new 131 or 132 registered cars all of the time.  A person who is paying to be driven from A to B has a legitimate expectation that the vehicle is comfortable and safe.<\/p><p>The Minister of State does not have an easy job.  I have no doubt that the taxi unions are not the easiest people in the world to deal with and they have an inflated sense of expectation.  However, there are thousands of genuine and hardworking taxi drivers who want to do the right thing and go out every day with the best intention to provide a good service in a safe vehicle and earn an honest day's pay for an honest day's work.  I want to see the industry protected for the sake of those people.  I have no doubt that we will have to introduce further legislation for the sector.  I will wait and see how the current legislation transcends into reality.  Obviously its enforcement element is extremely important.  I am delighted to note that the Minister of State has made provisions to ensure that the legislation is enforced because, as we all know, legislation is no use unless it is enforced.  I wish him well and applaud the legislation.       <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300015#O00400","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358944800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I call on Senator Paschal Mooney and he has six minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300016#P00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1358944800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>My colleague, Senator O'Sullivan, has already outlined the Fianna F\u00e1il position on the Bill.  My party welcomes it in general and in principle apart from some aspects which he has pointed out regarding the transfer of licences, etc.  I am sure that the Minister of State will deal with the matter.<\/p><p>  I agree with the objective behind the new legislation and regulations.  The excellent Bills Digest compiled by the Oireachtas Library &amp; Research Service states: <ul>The objective of the new legislation and regulations is to improve the quality of taxi services and the safety of passengers.  Combined these will have a significant impact on the taxi industry.  Standards should improve.  Individuals with criminal convictions who should not have taxi licences will be prevented from receiving or holding one.<\/ul>I shall focus on something that Senator O'Sullivan also raised and perhaps the Minister of State has already responded.  There is more than anecdotal evidence that people are driving taxis around the city who do not know one street from the other.  I have experienced it myself.  I am not being discriminatory when I say that it has nearly always been non-nationals who do this.  It has got to the point, and I make no apologies for it, that I prefer to go to a local taxi driver rather than somebody who is obviously a non-national.  My decision has nothing to do with the colour of his or her skin but is a response to my personal experience of taking taxis from Connolly Station only to discover that the taxi drivers did not know how to get to Merrion Square.  I have been in a taxi where the driver had to use the satnav.  I have asked long-serving taxi drivers about the matter and they told me that they wonder how the taxi licence authority can determine whether a driver has acquired sufficient knowledge.  I know that Senator O'Sullivan referred to the London experience.  I remember a famous television programme broadcast a few decades ago which was based on a test called &quot;the knowledge&quot; that all licensed London taxi drivers must pass.  It was an extraordinary documentary on the hoops that aspiring taxi drivers in London must go through and I am not sure that such stringent testing is carried out here.  The Bills Digest states:<ul>The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na issue SPSV Driver licences.  To qualify for a SPSV Driver's licence a person must hold an Irish driving licence or a driving licence from another EU, EEA or other recognised state, produce a current tax clearance certificate, and pass the SPSV Entry Test to obtain the SPSV Skills Development Certificate.  This test is in two parts: the Area Knowledge Test verifies that the driver has a good knowledge of the county in which they intend to operate; the Industry Knowledge Test verifies that they understand the taxi industry and the SPSV Regulations.<\/ul>I have a quibble with the first part and I would be grateful if the Minister of State could outline his thinking on the matter.  Obviously there is something wrong with the system, and taxi drivers will say the same, when it comes to certain conditions.  I understand that existing taxi drivers were not obliged to undergo the test but I am not sure if that is true.  It is a real concern.  There seems to be a higher proportion of non-nationals operating in the taxi industry than I see in any other industry.  Perhaps that is just my perception and it may not be true.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the branding that has been introduced which went under the radar here.  Many of us would love the establishment of a similar test to the London black cabs here.  Other countries have introduced a designated colour or model of taxi.  The taxi industry has resisted the introduction of a change of colour or model of taxi on the grounds of cost.  The Minister of State was right to initiate the branding and I hope that he will go further.  The capital city should have a distinctive taxi brand that visitors can relate to.  There is no difficulty in recognising a taxi here but from an optics, tourism and image point of view, branding should not be left to one side.  He should continue to push out the boat when it comes to branding.  I am not sure that he will succeed in getting taxi drivers to agree on a particular type of car model.  If he were, then it would have to be introduced over the long term.  I am not sure whether discussions had taken place with stakeholders when he reached the conclusion that branding would be the minimum that would be accepted by the taxi industry.  Overall my party welcomes the main thrust of the Bill and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's comments.       <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300016#P00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1358944800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I compliment him on the good work that he has done in the Department.

As the Minister of State has said, the legislation is an attempt to clean up some problems and difficulties that occurred in the taxi business.  <\/p><p>I share Senator Barrett's concern that there might be a suggestion that we are attempting to exclude new entrants or new operators.  A real concern for people who operate in the business at present is that there are many unregistered or illegal operators who make life very difficult and jeopardise the livelihood of legitimate and properly regulated licensed operators.  <\/p><p>We all agree that the public is entitled to a safe, affordable and reliable transport system.  It is vital - and the legislation will provide for it - that people who have not been convicted of serious crimes or people who have a reputable character are the holders of taxi licences.  We have seen a limited number of incidents of people who were convicted of serious crimes here being in possession of a taxi licence and it is a concern.  People must feel safe when they are at their most vulnerable and they expect to be safe at all times in a public transport vehicle.  <\/p><p>There has been a lot of talk about the quality of vehicles and Senator O'Neill referred to it. <\/p> <p>It is frightening to think that a vehicle that had been written off by an insurance company could end up being used as a taxi.  We must tighten the regulation to ensure that does not happen.<\/p><p>I agree with many of my colleagues that the majority of taxi drivers are decent, honourable people who go about their business in a professional manner.  In many instances they go above and beyond the call of duty to assist and facilitate people who might be in difficult circumstances late at night or those who find themselves short of resources.  They are amenable and accommodating to such people.<\/p><p>Many Members spoke about the demerit system, and I welcome what is contained in this legislation regarding that.  It goes without saying that driver knowledge should be a prerequisite for obtaining and possessing a taxi licence.  If taxi drivers are not in possession of the knowledge of the area in which they are operating they are not suitable people to be providing a service.  There is no way the shortest available route will be traversed if a taxi driver is not in possession of the local knowledge.<\/p><p>A key part to this legislation, and it is an area many people are concerned about, is enforcement of the regulation.  I have anecdotal evidence that on a night when somebody from the regulator's office is present in the city of Galway, all the illegal operators leave town and the legitimate taxi operators have a decent night's takings.  However, as soon as the regulator is out of the area the illegal operators are back in business again.  Putting in place a regulation system that can control that properly, and I understand the Minister of State might outsource this particular facility, will be the key to the success of the legislation before the House.  <\/p><p>I ask the Minister to take on board the appeal made by previous speakers that in the event of the death of the licence holder, particularly where it is a family business, there will be some facility to allow the transfer of a licence to another family member.<\/p><p>An issue was brought to my attention which the Minister might address.  I refer to a public service vehicle person who is a sole operator with two vehicles and depending on the number of passengers he may have to switch that vehicle's use several times during the day.  This person recently attempted to register the two vehicles but he was told he could register only one of them and that every time he used the second vehicle he must take the other vehicle off registration and register that vehicle.  Is there any way a situation like that can be accommodated where the person would not have to switch registrations several times a day?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300016#P00600","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358945400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300017#Q00200","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1358945400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to discuss the Bill which is important legislation.  Many of the points I had hoped to make have been covered already, especially the positive aspects of the legislation, and therefore I will not labour on them too much.<\/p><p>We all know that for many people the taxi industry is in crisis and that across the State taxi drivers and their families increasingly are facing a bleak future.  The over-supply of licences per application of existing regulations and the dramatic loss of trade have pushed hundreds of taxi drivers out of business and thousands more into real financial difficulty.  <\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan said that he did not want to leave himself open to a sucker punch but as mentioned earlier, we cannot deny that the previous Administration left the industry in bad shape and that many of the problems facing the taxi industry arose under those Administrations.  This Government has not been quick enough to act but I welcome this legislation.  The Minister has brought other legislation to the House and therefore I welcome that it is forthcoming.<\/p><p>While elements of the Bill are clearly positive - other Members have mentioned them and I will not labour them - the full extent of the crisis in the industry or the weaknesses in the existing regulatory regime have been adequately dealt with.  That in part comes back to the lack of a real engagement with the industry as a whole, whether it be with the representative bodies or individual drivers.  As Senators mentioned earlier, many individual drivers want to make a living.  They may not be part of the representative groups but they have a good deal of input to make.  There is greater scope for dialogue with them on this issue.<\/p><p>In terms of the feedback I have been getting from some of those representatives and taxi drivers, they expressed some dissatisfaction with the Bill we are debating today.  <\/p><p>I welcome many aspects of the Bill but I want to deal with some specific aspects about which I am concerned.  In that respect we will be looking at amendments which will be dealt with further in the D\u00e1il.<\/p><p>The issue of additional fixed charges and taxi penalty points must be looked at again.  Mandatory disqualification for criminal convictions needs further scrutiny, particularly in the absence of spent convictions legislation.  We mentioned previously at other opportunities that there is a need to ensure that political prisoners released under the Good Friday Agreement are not disqualified from working in the industry.  The Minister might want to comment on that.<\/p><p>The section of the Bill dealing with declaring other work is too weak.  Not only is a requirement voluntary but, crucially, there is no restriction on people having full-time jobs while working as part-time drivers.  <\/p><p>Other important issues are not covered by the Bill, the most significant of which is the over-supply of licences and the inadequacies of the vetting system.  Since regulation the number of licences has increased seven fold and in many areas there are too many taxis on the roads, too many multi-licence holders and too many part-time drivers.  That was compounded by the inadequate vetting system.<\/p><p>If we are to have a quality taxi industry that provides a quality service to people and a stable income for drivers and their families those key issues must be addressed.  We have argued previously that the taxi regulation directorate must be held to account through the D\u00e1il committee and biannual reviews.  As I said, there is a need for improved vetting, a minimum hours requirement for drivers, and greater regulation of the rental market to ensure best service and safety for taxis as well as allowing full-time drivers to make a decent living.<\/p><p>We want the taxi industry to recover; nobody here would refute that.  We want to make sure that the best quality service is provided to customers and that the industry provides well-paid, stable employment to drivers.  The Bill goes a great way towards some of that but much more needs to be done.  I thank the Minister of State for all the work he has done in the area and for bringing so much legislation before the Seanad recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300017#Q00300","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1358945400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Senator Feargal Quinn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300017#Q00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1358945400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The Minister of State in his opening remarks described it as a defining year for the taxi industry.  It may be; it is certainly about time.  It has been a complete and absolute mess and a large part of that mess comes from the Government and regulators.<\/p><p>I remember speaking in this House on the question of the nine-year rule where taxi drivers were forced to get rid of their cars after nine years which made a farce of the national car test.  The test applied to the interior and the condition of the vehicles.  What is the point of having these things when one can certify the car is perfectly roadworthy and wonderfully maintained and yet simply because of the year one must get rid of it?  It was a nonsense.  Taxi drivers were badly caught and I know for a fact that some of them got rid of them, bought new cars at huge disadvantage and, due to pressure from this House among other sources, that was rescinded.  That is very unfair and shows a lack of consultation.  <\/p> <p>To a very large extent I am on the side of taxi drivers, the vast majority of whom are decent, hardworking people who have been dealt with in an incoherent way.<\/p><p>I refer to the &quot;scenic route&quot; observation which, although it is a kind of urban myth, also occurs in every jurisdiction.  I have experienced it in India and the United States but not, so far, in this country, rather the reverse, where I have taken the opportunity to advise the taxi driver about the shortest way.  On a map I was right but the journey took twice as long because I had not taken into account the existence of taxi lanes.  However, the driver did what I asked him.  I am aware also of the very unreasonable attitude taken by a small proportion of the public towards taxi drivers whereby they take a taxi for a journey of less than half a mile and cause the driver to lose position in the rank.  A number of us spoke about suicide this morning.  I have had to draw the attention of the House to the very high proportion of suicides among taxi people.  It is a crucifying situation at present in terms of costs and the downturn.  We must keep this human aspect in our perspective.  <\/p><p>I refer to the question of demerits and the removal of certain categories of person from the taxi service.  Certainly this should apply in cases of convictions of a serious criminal nature and I applaud the Minister of State 100% on this measure.  I consider it outrageous that people who are guilty of armed robbery, murder, serious drug offences and rape should be allowed to drive a taxi.  I do not give a damn about double jeopardy or anything else.  It is absolutely essential to protect people.  There was a horrible rape case recently.  If we are serious about it we must address this matter and hit the nail completely.<\/p><p>I hope there will be a universally applicable knowledge test.  Like my colleagues I have had some experiences, and will end with one.  I took a taxi from Leinster House, wishing to go to North Great Georges Street.  The driver did not know where it was and began to drive me to South Great Georges Street, near Aungier Street.  I told him the street was on the other side of the river.  He said, &quot;What river?&quot;  I said, &quot;What planet?  I am legging it out of this car&quot;, and did so.  Many of these people, judging by their accent or skin tone, appear to be new Irish.  I have also had very good experiences with people who fall into that category.  It is a disservice to the new Irish not to have a universally applicable requirement.  That would register with people, especially those who say they would not get into a taxi driven by an eastern European or a Nigerian.  That is wrong but it is our responsibility to ensure drivers are qualified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300017#Q00600","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358946000,"counter":111,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome and so is this Bill.  I would like to see some changes in it, particularly in regard to quantitative control, as referred to by Senator Barrett, as opposed to quality control.  Twenty years ago I brought a group of some 1,500 visitors to Ireland for a big conference, everyone staying in five-star bedrooms.  Those who came to plan it some months ahead of time could not get a taxi from their restaurant to where they were staying.  They were told it would take three or four hours because the queues were so long.  We nearly lost that conference that day.  It is very important that whatever controls we implement concentrate on quality rather than quantity.<\/p><p>There is a necessity to have a knowledge test.  The city of Hull has a population of 250,000.  From April its taxi drivers must pass a six week course before they can get a taxi licence.  The course will entail them knowing that city back to front.  Dublin is much bigger but I am sure that a six-week course that insisted every taxi driver should know the city would solve of the problems Senator Norris has mentioned.<\/p><p>Can the Minister of State tell me what the rules are about having to have a first aid kit and fluorescent jackets in every taxi in order to ensure that if there is an accident passengers will be safe?  If we do not have such rules we should have because these are the sort of measures that would be of benefit.  This Bill is most welcome but let us see if we can improve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300018#R00200","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1358946000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their contributions and will endeavour to respond to points in as much detail as I can.<\/p><p>I really enjoy coming to this House where it is good form to tease out and debate issues.  I have attended on the subject of taxis in general as some months ago there were statements on the issue.  Much of the commentary has been on the regulatory side, as were many of the points today.  I will not go into as much detail now as before but will hit on a few points.  This debate is more about the legislation.  Having been in this role for the past 22 months I know that if there is one industry we could stay talking about it is the taxi industry and its regulations.  One could not put two taxi drivers into a room and expect them to agree about any form of regulation so when one widens the subject one will certainly not get agreement.  <\/p><p>The Taxi Regulation Bill is the single most important piece of legislation in this regard and is a milestone for the industry.  Let us remember this legislation was prepared in conjunction with a complete overhaul of all the regulations in the industry.  A serious volume of regulations is being introduced this month.  Senators will have seen all the new signage and changes in signage which is the first phase and intended to make the industry more professional.  There are changes in regard to information provision, licensing and control of the rental industry - the latter of which is paramount to the success of the industry because it had gone far out of control.  The legislation is in parallel with the new regulations.<\/p><p>There is a great amount of qualitative, rather than quantitative, changes that will clean up the industry in a positive way.  Speaking as a former tourism executive I note that a course is being run by F\u00e1ilte Ireland for taxi drivers who operate from the airports, in regard to customer servicing and dealing with tourists coming into the country.  It is a small thing but will make another contribution.  Taxi drivers who do this course will get an acknowledgement for doing so.  There are many changes taking place in an incremental way that have been needed for a long time.<\/p><p>This is a very open and transparent process.  I have had many meetings with industry representatives.  I have chaired the taxi review committee; there is also a taxi committee and a standards steering group.  I have taken in both oral and written submissions and have met many of the groups.  The NTA had a consultative phase in regard to standards.  I ask Senators to trust me when I say we get ongoing representations to my office on a daily basis - there are hundreds of such representations.  If I do not get to look at some of them I will hear them on Joe Duffy's &quot;Liveline&quot; from week to week.  There is a great deal of commentary.  I was left to digest all of this during the past year or so before introducing this legislation, which I believe is fair.  I worked with the NTA to bring about the regulatory changes that will work in tandem with the legislation.<\/p><p>I will refer now to Senators' comments.  Senator O'Sullivan asked why the legislation was not introduced before now.  I could throw the question back at Members.  The Bill should have been introduced before now.  To be fair, some of the legislation was introduced, albeit in a different version, in the Bill of 2003 but there are questions as to why that Bill was not enacted.  There were issues about the types of drivers and the mandatory disqualifications.  Perhaps the previous Administration did not believe the legislation was rigorous enough.  I have improved it making it much more vigorous in a court of law and have given the necessary powers to garda\u00ed that they requested.<\/p> <p>I have met on numerous occasions with the Commissioner and other garda\u00ed, in particular the Garda representatives on the review committee.  I am not personally in favour of capping the volume of licences.  Such a policy is legally questionable and has never, as such, been on the agenda.<\/p><p> I wish to debunk an idea about the knowledge test and entry to the industry.  We have a problem.  The tests required to become a taxi driver are rigorous and I would be surprised if any Senator could pass such a test were I to impose one in relation to the area which he or she is from.  He or she would have to know where each bank and sports centre was located in a county and how to get there within a prescribed period of time.  The pass rate is low.  The problem is that many drivers obtained licences in the period before the test was put in place.  Those drivers have not been subject to the rigorous evaluation that is now required.  It is very difficult as a matter of law to withdraw a licence from a person who obtained it under a pre-existing procedure.  There are measures in place, however, to deal with circumstances in which licence holders are subject to demerits or convictions.  It is an historical situation which I inherited.  I wanted to ensure that the tests are rigorous, which they are, but there was a lacuna previously which it is not easy to address.<\/p><p> Taxi plates should not have a monetary value.  A driving licence should not have a monetary value or be transferable.  It was a mistake to allow a situation develop where there was a resale value for taxi plates.  Where a plate has a monetary value it causes a range of difficulties.  The issue is whether a person is a suitable, qualified person who meets the regulatory requirements to drive a taxi.  It may be that an exceptional circumstance exists where a licence holder passes away whereby provision would be made to allow a once-off transfer to a family member.<\/p><p> I agree with the speaker who referred to taxi stands in respect of which there is scope for improvement.  We are working with local authorities on off-peak loading bays and other measures.  It is an issue, particularly in large urban areas.  I agree with all Senators who referred to rural areas.  As with all rural areas, there are too few taxi licence holders in Portroe where I am from.  We are considering a rural hackney licence in respect of which the key issue of insurance falls to be resolved.  I thank Senators O'Sullivan and Mooney for their support for the Bill, which is very much appreciated.  I thank them for their encouragement on branding and other changes we have made in the industry recently.<\/p><p> To respond to Senator Pat O'Neill, there will not be any overlap between the penalty points applicable to a driving licence and a taxi licence.  It would not be appropriate.  He asked about the rental market.  While the renting out of licences is one of the most significant regulatory issues which requires to be dealt with, the problem can be overstated.  While I share some of Senator Barrett's sentiments in that regard and disagree fundamentally with others, it is a fact that the process under which licences could be rented out was too loose.  Now we have to rent out the package.  There is a need for a rental market where cars have been crashed or on foot of certain other reasons.  Where a car is rented out, there is a responsibility not just for the vehicle but for the equipment, signage and insurance and for notifying the NTA that the person driving the car is qualified.  It is a huge step in the right direction.<\/p><p> I thank my colleague, Senator Susan O'Keeffe, for her positive contributions.  I am very supportive of full and part-time taxi drivers.  I have a particular empathy for those trying to make a full-time living from taxi driving and they need to be supported.  The Senator spoke about the information being provided by drivers and how that system will operate to allow us to ensure that a driver is who he or she says he or she is.  The implementation of the system is imminent.  I expect there to be mobile phone applications whereby a customer can check the number of a taxi online to ensure that the driver is the person authorised to drive the taxi.  If the picture displayed by the application does not match the person behind the wheel, you will not stay in the car.  It is for this reason that those working in the industry will have to update their information in real time so that we can ensure that those driving vehicles are the right people.<\/p><p> It is proposed that licence holders who are the subject of a number of complaints on their area knowledge shall resit the test.  I have had the experience referred to by many Members of having to approach a number of taxis before a driver knew the destination I wished to travel to.  Senator Barrett spoke about the low number of complaints and I have worked with the NTA to ensure that the procedure for making complaints is improved and made more accessible.  Many people do not bother to complain because it is not easy.  The complaints procedure should be moved online and made available,<i>inter alia<\/i>, by way of mobile technology.  There will be substantial improvements in enforcement.  The Bill will allow the NTA to deploy more enforcement officers to ensure that the legislative provisions and regulations are enforced to the required level.<\/p><p> Senator Susan O'Keeffe referred to drivers working long hours.  We have considered everything in this area.  While it is not practical to place tachometers on taxis, there is a provision whereby an SPSV licence applicant must notify his or her employers of such application.  It is an important step.  It is a difficult area to manage.  The Organisation of Working Time Act applies where an employer knows a person who is working 39 hours a week is also working weekends as a taxi driver.  This is a qualitative measure which will deal with some of those who should not be working in the industry given the nature of their other work.<\/p><p> Senator Barrett raised a number of regulatory issues.  The Goodbody report has not been forgotten.  I agree with the Senator on some of the comments on new entrants.  We cannot paint everyone with the same brush.  I disagree fundamentally with the Senator on the issue of double jeopardy and agree with Senator Norris.  I do not know how many people would agree with a convicted rapist driving a taxi.  I abhor the idea that a member of my family could get into a taxi with such a person.  It is not acceptable and we must introduce legislation to ensure it does not happen.  Such legislation must be rigorous enough to stand up in court.  Fundamental to the Bill is the need to ensure that people convicted of very serious crimes of murder, manslaughter, rape, terrorism, torture, trafficking and various other sexual offences cannot drive taxis.  Whether the effect is retrospective or prospective, they should not be allowed to drive taxis.  Those who have committed serious burglary, firearms, assault, threat, coercion, harassment, violent disorder or criminal damage offences may have their licences suspended, refused or revoked depending on the length of any sentence imposed.<\/p> <p>Those who have been sentenced to seven years in prison will lose their licences for five years; those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of between five and seven years can lose their licences for up to three years; those whose sentences were two to three years in prison can lose their licences for two years, and where their sentence was two years in prison, they will lose their licences for 18 months.  This measure has to be proportionate, as, legally, it must be rigorous.  That is why it is being done in this manner.  <\/p><p>Unfortunately, there have been cases in which the Garda declared it did not consider a person was a fit and proper person to a drive, yet that person received his or her licence back because he or she had to earn a living.  If unsavoury characters pose a clear and present danger, the Garda will apply to ensure they will not get their licences back.  Those with driving convictions, for example, persons caught for drink driving or dangerous driving offences, will be put off the road for an extra three to five years, which is appropriate, given that it is a motoring offence.  <\/p><p>As regards proportionality, it is also important to ensure there is a 12 month period during which people can appeal.  The powers of the Garda have been strengthened in order that in court it it will now be in a more powerful position to identify the individuals who should not be behind the wheel of a taxi and can be more confident that it will be on a sound legal footing to ensure the individuals concerned will not receive a licence.<\/p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett has said there has not been much fraud activity.  That was an initial outlay.  I have spoken to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and it will be done in a more rigorous way in the future.  I have seen data to justify the argument that there is a much higher rate of fraud.  I expect that through this qualitative process we will be able to deal with many of those who are behaving fraudulently.  It is outrageous to ask where we are going to stop in preventing people from entering the industry.  It is crazy to compare preventing somebody from working in agriculture with preventing a person from being behind the wheel of taxi driving members of the public.  They are not similar and I ask the Senator to reflect on this.  We are discussing people who will be prevented from receiving a licence to drive a taxi with individuals in the back who could my loved ones or those of the Senator or anyone else.  If the people concerned have serious convictions, they should look for work in other industries.  They should not be behind the wheel of a taxi offering a public service.<\/p><p>I applaud Senator Martin Conway's common-sense comments.  I have addressed Senator Paschal Mooney's comments too.  <\/p><p>On the question of branding, I know that Senator Mooney is very strong on the issue of tourism and there will be other issues I will consider to try to improve the connectivity between the industry and the tourism sector.<\/p><p>The issue raised by Senator R\u00f3n\u00e1n Mullen in respect of an individual taxi driver relates to the updating of information.  If he gives me the name of the individual, I will look into the matter.  In the future a taxi owner will have to update the information available on who is behind the wheel of a car.<\/p><p>I disagree with Senator Kathryn Reilly that the Bill has not been introduced quickly enough.  It has literally been a whirlwind trip to ensure the regulations have been changed and the legislation brought forward.  We have worked very closely with the Attorney General in bringing it forward.  Anybody who fits the definitions included in the Bill and has the criminal convictions I outlined will be dealt with in the same manner.  It is not illegal to have two jobs.  I respect the spirit of what has been said about somebody who is a public servant also working in the taxi industry.  The enforcement of qualitative measures and regulatory changes to ensure people adhere to the regulations and the question of whether it will be worth people's while to do so if they have other jobs are important.  It is not, nor should it be, illegal to have two jobs.<\/p><p>I thank Senators David Norris and Feargal Quinn for their contributions.  I think I have dealt with the issues they raised.  As far as I am aware, it is necessary to have a first aid kit in the vehicle.  I have to admit, however, that I need to find out the exact specifics in that regard.<\/p><p>I again thank Senators for their contributions and look forward to taking the Bill on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300018#R00300","speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358947200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1358947200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300020#T00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1358947200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>On Wednesday, 30 January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300020#T00400","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358947200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 30 January 2013.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358947200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 2.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Water Services Bill 2013: Order for Second Stage","time":1358947800,"counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300021#U00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358947800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Bill entitled an Act to make provision in relation to the installation and maintenance of water meters in dwellings; for that purpose to provide for the formation of a subsidiary company by Bord G\u00e1is \u00c9ireann and the performance of certain functions under the Water Services Act 2007 by Bord G\u00e1is \u00c9ireann and that subsidiary company; to amend the Gas Act 1976 and the Water Services Act 2007; to provide for the collection of certain information by Bord G\u00e1is \u00c9ireann and that subsidiary company; and to provide for matters connected therewith.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1358947800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I move: \"That Second Stage be taken today.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300021#U00300","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358947800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Water Services Bill 2013: Second Stage","time":1358947800,"counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300021#U00500"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1358947800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1358947800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Is m\u00f3r an on\u00f3ir dom a bheith anseo ar\u00eds don d\u00edosp\u00f3ireacht ar an \u00e1bhar t\u00e1bhachtach seo - uisce agus sol\u00e1thar uisce don t\u00edr go l\u00e9ir.

It is the first legislative milestone in the Government's strategy for the reform of water services provision in Ireland.  It provides for the establishment of Irish Water or Uisce \u00c9ireann as a subsidiary of Bord G\u00e1is under the Companies Acts.  The two organisation names will be interchangeable.<\/p><p>The programme for Government provides for progressive and considerable structural reforms of the water services sector.  There are three interrelated components to the Government's proposed reforms for the water services sector and to date the following key decisions have been taken by Government: to establish Irish Water as an independent State-owned company within the Bord G\u00e1is group, based on a public utility model; to introduce a sustainable funding model to support much needed investment in this sector, to include the introduction of water charges for domestic users; and to establish an independent economic regulator for water services, a function being assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.<\/p><p>Our water resources are a significant national asset and there have been significant improvements in the quality and capacity of our water and wastewater infrastructure during the past decade.  This has been achieved on foot of substantial Exchequer investment through successive water services investment programmes.  The Environmental Protection Agency noted in its publication, Ireland's Environment 2012: An Assessment, that our water quality is good relative to other EU countries.  A decade earlier the EPA Environment in Focus 2002 report noted that the quality of our rivers was &quot;unacceptably poor&quot; while our groundwater had &quot;unacceptably high levels of contamination&quot;.  Maintaining these improvements in quality and standards will be a considerable challenge in the coming years against the backdrop of severe restrictions on the public finances, which have seriously impacted on the Government's ability to maintain the previous levels of capital investment.  Our valuable water resources also serve to support the success of many water-dependent sectors of the economy, most notably the pharma-chemical, information and communications technology and food and drink sectors.<\/p><p>The key objective of the Government's water reform programme is to put in place structures and funding arrangements to ensure that we have a world-class water and wastewater infrastructure which meets all environmental and public health standards and which is well positioned to attract new foreign direct investment and to support job creation in indigenous companies as well.<\/p><p>The EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland includes commitments to introduce domestic water charges and to establish a national water utility.  While the Government is committed to introducing water charges, it considers that volumetric-based charging is the fairest approach to charging.  The annual cost of water services in Ireland is \u20ac1.2 billion.  Ireland is the only country in the OECD that does not charge for domestic water.  The OECD stated in its review of our environmental performance in 2010 that the absence of volumetric charging gives domestic users no incentive to save water and that it perpetuates a low awareness of the real cost of water services.<\/p><p>The Government has decided that Irish Water should be responsible for the installation of water meters for households connected to public water supplies and the Bill provides the company with the necessary powers to achieve this.  The metering programme will commence later this year and it will be accompanied by a comprehensive public information campaign.<\/p><p>There is considerable public dissatisfaction with the levels of unaccounted-for water, including leakage from water distribution mains.  Investment in recent years has been prioritised on mains rehabilitation and leakage reduction.  The metering programme will assist greatly in improving the management of water supply networks and will assist in targeting investment.  Experience internationally and in Ireland with the non-domestic sector and private group water schemes indicates that metering will promote water efficiency and conservation by users.  The Government is keen to ensure that the interests of consumers will be protected when domestic water charges commence.  We intend to provide the Commission for Energy Regulation with the necessary powers to regulate the water sector and to determine the appropriate level of charges.<\/p><p>The Bill provides the commission with the power to advise the Government on the development of policy regarding the regulation of water services.<\/p> <p>The intention is that the new policy will be given legislative effect later this year when the Commission will be given full regulatory powers, including the authority to set water tariffs.<\/p><p> I would also like to address the impact of the reforms on the local authority sector and, in particular, on local authority employees.  Given the scale and complexity of change involved in this reform process, engagement with staff and unions is critically important and a specific structure, the Irish Water consultative group, has been put in place to facilitate this.  Good progress is being made on clarifying issues for staff.  During the period to the end of 2017, other than situations where existing staff are recruited to new positions in Irish Water, existing staff will remain employees of local authorities working either under service-level agreements or working on a secondment basis to Irish Water.  Where employees are working under a service-level agreement they will carry out their existing role and this arrangement will continue until at least 2017 unless otherwise agreed at the Irish Water consultative group.<\/p><p> Some existing water functions are likely to transfer to Irish Water on establishment or on a phased basis in the period 2014 to 2017.  These largely relate to management roles and roles associated with the delivery of the capital programme.  It is envisaged that the staff currently carrying out these functions would move to Irish Water on secondment in the period to 2017 and would, therefore, remain as employees of the relevant local authority.  During this period, some staff could transfer to Irish Water by agreement.  The framework for such secondments or transfers would be considered at the Irish Water consultative group.<\/p><p> Before I set out the provisions of the Bill I would like to address some of the matters which are not specifically provided for in this Bill but which will, subject to Government approval, be comprehensively addressed in more detailed legislation which is under development and which will be brought forward in a separate Bill in the second half of this year.  As I said earlier, the Commission for Energy Regulation will be given full regulatory powers later this year.  These powers will include the power to examine all costs incurred by Irish Water in the delivery of water services and to determine what levels of tariffs are appropriate for Irish Water to charge for the services.  The regulator will be responsible for setting standards of performance for Irish Water and for ensuring that appropriate customer protection measures are in place.<\/p><p> The next Bill will confer powers on Irish Water for the provision of water services which are currently the responsibility of the county and city councils.  This would include, <i>inter alia<\/i>, power to provide water and wastewater services directly, responsibility for strategic planning and delivering investment programmes and powers of examination and survey.  It will also provide for the transfer of local authority water assets and associated liabilities to Irish Water.  The establishment of an asset base will be an important step in ensuring that Irish Water will, in the future, be able to access financial markets to secure funds for capital investment.  The accountability of the company to the Oireachtas will also be addressed in more detail, as well as its interaction with local government and the functions that local government discharges in respect of planning, economic development and emergency management.  I know from speaking to members from all sides of both Houses of the Oireachtas that these are critical issues which I assure members will be addressed in the next phase of the legislative programme.<\/p><p> I will now outline the purpose and operation of each section of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 set out the Title of the Bill and commencement provisions and definitions of terms used in the Bill.  Section 3 is a standard provision enabling the expenses incurred by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for the administration of this legislation to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 4 provides that Bord G\u00e1is shall establish a subsidiary company, Irish Water, under the Companies Acts, following consultation with the relevant Ministers.  Section 5 outlines that the subsidiary will be known as Uisce \u00c9ireann in Irish and Irish Water in English.  The shares in the company are to be distributed between Bord G\u00e1is, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  Bord G\u00e1is will be allocated the only voting share which it will not be allowed to alter without the consent of the two Ministers.  The two Ministers will share the remaining shares between them.  This share structure will ensure that Irish Water remains in full public State ownership.<\/p><p> Section 6 sets out conditions relating to the memorandum and articles of association of the company and provides that they must be approved by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, with the consent of the relevant Ministers.  Any amendment to the memorandum or articles of association can only be made with ministerial approval.  Section 7 is a standard provision and sets out the circumstances in which a director of Irish Water will no longer be qualified and must cease to be a director.  Section 8 outlines the standard prohibitions on directors or members of staff of Irish Water holding political office, either at national or European level.  Sections 9 and 10 are also standard provisions setting out the requirements for the disclosure of interests by directors or staff of Irish Water of any material interest, in the case of directors, in any arrangement or agreement for consideration of Irish Water and in the case of staff, in their capacity as employees.<\/p><p> Section 11 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by a director, member of staff, consultant or adviser to Irish Water, unless authorised to do so.  This prohibition will not apply to the disclosure of confidential information to Bord G\u00e1is however.  Confidential information for the purposes of this section includes information expressed by Irish Water to be confidential either as regards particular information or a particular class of information or description and proposals of a commercial nature or any tenders submitted to Irish Water.<\/p><p> Section 12 provides that Bord G\u00e1is and Irish Water may borrow money, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The aggregate borrowings of Bord G\u00e1is and Irish Water for the purpose of this legislation must not exceed &#8364;500 million.  The section specifies that the borrowing limit is additional to the limits for Bord G\u00e1is set out in section 23 of the Gas Act 1976.  Money borrowed in currencies other than the euro will be deemed equivalent subject to the rate of exchange at the time of the borrowing.  Money borrowed by Bord G\u00e1is under this section may subsequently be lent to Irish Water.<\/p><p> Section 13 provides that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government may, for the purposes of this legislation, make grants out of money provided by the Oireachtas to Irish Water, Bord G\u00e1is or the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Section 14 provides that subsections (1) and (2) of section 21 of the Gas Act shall apply to Bord G\u00e1is, such that the approval of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be required for capital expenditure by Irish Water above a level to be specified.<\/p><p> Section 15 relates to the accounts of Irish Water.  It contains standard provisions on the maintenance by and audit of the accounts of Irish Water and the submission of audited accounts and any other accounts to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The accounts must then be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The section also sets out the arrangements for the appointment by Irish Water of an auditor to audit the accounts and for the ministerial approval of the fees of the auditor.  Section 16 provides that by 30 June each year, Irish Water will prepare and submit to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, a report on the performance of its activities in the area of water services in the preceding year.  The report must then be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> Sections 17 to 21 deal with the water metering programme and confers powers on Bord G\u00e1is and the new company as metering authorities.  I referred earlier to the Government's position regarding the fairness of volumetric-based charging.  In addition to this, the domestic water metering programme will have significant economic and employment benefits.  The programme, which is the largest and most ambitious programme of its kind that we are aware of, will commence later this year.  It will be preceded by the surveying of domestic water connections at the external boundary of households connected to public water supplies.  This work will be undertaken by the local authorities.  This surveying work will commence across all local authorities shortly.  On the issue of the meter installation works, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Bord G\u00e1is have already commenced the procurement procedures for the sub-contractors, regional management contractors and equipment for the metering programme, which will be rolled out over a three-year period.  Section 17 provides that a reference to a metering authority in sections 17 to 21 means Bord G\u00e1is or Irish Water.<\/p><p> Section 18 provides that the functions of a water services authority with regard to the installation of water meters for dwellings may be carried out by a metering authority in addition to a water services authority.  It also provides that other functions of a water services authority may also be carried out by Bord G\u00e1is and Irish Water to the extent that their performance is necessary for the installation of water meters for dwellings.  These would include, for example, the power to lay pipes and the power to interrupt water supplies at sections 41 and 51 of the 2007 Act, respectively.<\/p> <p> Section 19 provides that the provisions in section 41 of the Water Services Act 2007 relating to the installation of pipes shall apply to a metering authority, subject to the removal of a requirement to obtain the consent of a road authority, which applies when the water services authority is not the road authority.  The water services authorities are the 34 city and county councils which are also road authorities.  The installation of pipes by Bord G\u00e1is and Irish Water will be exempt from the need to obtain planning permission.  This is necessary to avoid causing delays to the metering programme and, having regard to the level of excavation work required to install a meter, planning permission is unnecessary.  The Department and Bord G\u00e1is will agree a protocol with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the local authorities which will specify the standards for the installation works nationwide.  This protocol will ensure the highest standards will be applied and will address issues such as traffic management, the quality required for footpath and road reinstatement and health and safety requirements.  We all know from our local authority experiences the appalling mess occasionally made in footpath and road reinstatements and the disgraceful way in which some roads were left.  This is a key issue.<\/p><p>Section 20 specifies that water meters will remain in the ownership of Irish Water and that Irish Water may not dispose of any property vested in it without ministerial consent.  Section 21 states the provisions of section 29 of the Water Services Act of 2007 shall apply to Bord G\u00e1is and Irish Water in the same way as they apply to a water services authority.  This provides for the immunity of these bodies and their employees from prosecution arising from carrying out their functions.  Section 22 is a standard provision and provides that Bord G\u00e1is and Irish Water will have all the powers necessary or expedient for the performance of their functions.<\/p><p>In order to create an accurate database of the names and addresses of domestic customers, Irish Water will be given the power to request information from other public and commercial bodies which hold similar information.  Section 23, therefore, provides that Irish Water and Bord G\u00e1is may request a relevant person to provide them with such information that they may require to perform their functions or that they could be expected to require if additional functions, similar to those vested in a water services authority, were conferred on them.  A relevant person may be a local authority, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, the holder for the time being of a licence granted under section 14 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Local Government Management Agency, the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social Protection and any other person prescribed by order made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government after consulting the Data Protection Commissioner.  A relevant person must comply with a request under this section.  The section amends sections 6 and 7 of the Water Services Act 2007 such that Bord G\u00e1is and Irish Water will have the same powers to obtain information as a water services authority, as well as the same entitlement to obtain information on ownership as a water services authority.  This provision will not exempt Irish Water from the requirements of data protection legislation.  Irish Water will agree a protocol with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to address the exchange and treatment of any personal information.  Discussions have been entered into with that office during the drafting of the legislation and the section includes a provision that the Data Protection Commissioner must be consulted before any proposal is made to extend the list of relevant persons.<\/p><p>Section 24 provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation may do all things necessary or expedient for the purpose of preparing for the performance of water regulatory functions under any future enactment.  The functions include functions relating to the setting of charges for water services, the specification of minimum standards of service for the provision of water services and the protection of the interests of a person in receipt of water services.  The section also states the commission may advise the Government on the development of policy for regulating the provision of water services.  Under the section, the commission may consult Bord G\u00e1is, Irish Water, the water services authorities or any person prescribed by order by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p>Following enactment of the Bill, the commission will be commencing its work.  At the earliest opportunity it will undertake public consultations on a range of issues, including the development of tariff structures, and prepare guidelines on consumer protection measures.<\/p><p>Sections 25 and 26 remove the existing prohibition on charging households for water services as set out in section 105 of the Water Services Act 2007 and section 4 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983, as amended by section 12 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997.  Section 105 of the 2007 Act has not been commenced and will not be commenced prior to the introduction of charges, which will not be before 1 January 2014.  This amendment is only being made to enable Bord G\u00e1is and Irish Water to undertake functions relating to domestic water charges such as the development of a customer database, the establishment of a billing system and the commencement of consultations with the public and other stakeholders.  Section 25 transfers the functions of a water services authority relating to charging dwellings for water services from the water services authorities to Bord G\u00e1is and Irish Water, while section 26 provides for the removal of the statutory prohibition by amending the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Acts.<\/p><p>Section 27 provides for the amendment of section 15 of the Gas Act 1976 in order that Bord G\u00e1is shall keep accounts of moneys received or expended by it in the performance of its functions in relation to this legislation.  Section 28 provides that Bord G\u00e1is must submit a report on its activities in the area of water services to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The report shall be submitted no later than 30 June each year and arrangements will be made as soon as possible after receipt of the report for copies to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Section 29 relates to directions issued by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Directions may be issued, subject to the approval of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to Bord G\u00e1is or Irish Water in relation to the performance of their functions and they must comply with a direction issued to them.  It is not the intention that ministerial directions would be issued to the companies, or that such directions would be necessary.  However, as the Bill is effectively interim legislation pending the introduction of a more comprehensive Bill later this year, the section is considered prudent to ensure Government policy is implemented appropriately by the companies.<\/p><p>As I stated, this is the first legislative milestone in the Government's strategy for the reform of water services provision in Ireland.  It is the first step in what is undoubtedly one of the most fundamental reforms of public services provision.  I look forward to engaging with Members on the provisions of the Bill.  An important part of this initiative is the creation of 2,000 jobs in each of the next three years as water meters and attendant infrastructure are installed.  This will give a significant boost to local economies everywhere.  A call centre will also be established to offer customers a point of contact.  I understand the call centre will create between 300 and 400 jobs.  This investment will, therefore, offer significant benefits in terms of job creation, as well as improving water services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300021#U00700","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358949000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and acknowledge his comments that the Bill will not be rushed and that he is open to accepting amendments as it progresses.

For the past year we have witnessed considerable internal confusion in the Cabinet about the cost of this project.  There has been no detail on how much consumers will pay and no public tendering for the new body.  The relevant Oireachtas committee has been bypassed and the public consultation process has been limited and flawed.<\/p> <p>None of this augurs well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300023#W00400","speaker":"1164","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358949600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>There were three hours of debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300024#X00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1358949600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has been unable to give any detail or proper answers about his Government's proposals for introducing water charging and dismantling the current water service system.  In their haste to hand the multi-million euro contract for water and wastewater services to Bord G\u00e1is, the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Hogan, could not even wait for the Oireachtas committee to complete its report.  While many of us were alarmed by this haste, at least it suggested that the Government had a plan and was pursuing it with some vigour and energy.  Sadly, our faith was ill placed because the Taoiseach and his Ministers were unable to answer the most basic questions about this plan.  It became clear that the Bord G\u00e1is announcement had more to do with the need to redirect embarrassing questions away from the Government than creating a better system for citizens.<\/p><p>  Last April, the Taoiseach boldly announced that there will be no job losses.  I genuinely hope he is right, but all the commentary and analysis suggests otherwise.  According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report that was commissioned by the Government, when the new structure is complete, synergies mean that the number of people employed in providing local water and wastewater services &quot;will be significantly lower than the 4,278 deployed today&quot;.  Can the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, tell us if he agrees with the Taoiseach's claim that there will be no job losses?  I know he alluded to this issue in his contribution.  Perhaps he can clarify the matter further on the basis of the comments I have made.  Does he agree with the Government's consultants and the officials in his Department?  The experience of our nearest neighbour in the North is illuminating.  In 2005-06, some 2,100 people were employed in local water services in Northern Ireland.  Its equivalent of the Bord G\u00e1is experiment was launched in April 2007.  There are now just 1,306 people employed in water and wastewater services there.  If anything like the same level of synergies is applied here, we will be looking at between 1,600 and 1,700 job losses.  Can the Minister of State comment on the likely numbers?  I hope he can say something to quell the uncertainty being experienced by current employees.<\/p><p>  The Government regards the creation of Irish Water and the roll-out of metering as vital parts of its job stimulus package.  However, I am uneasy about its decision to press ahead with investments in this area without clarifying the cost.  Senators on this side of the House believe the Government is putting the cart before the horse by bringing this Bill before the House at this juncture.  It has not yet passed the legislation that will secure the right of subcontractors to ensure they fully benefit from the stimulus.  Can the Minister of State offer us some clarity on this matter?<\/p><p>  We are deeply concerned about how much families will be asked to pay.  Surely the ultimate cost to the customer should be one of the Government's first considerations.  We have yet to get any detail on the level of free allowances and the total cost to the consumer.  This continuing uncertainty about how much people will have to pay for water metering can be attributed to the contradictory statements which have been made by various Cabinet members.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, has announced that people will receive their first water bills by the end of 2014 and has estimated that the annual cost could reach &#8364;400 per household.  The same Minister originally stated that the Government would implement water charging by 2014.  Reports in September 2012 indicated that metering would not be completed until 2016.<\/p><p>  The Government has at least three firmly stated, yet mutually contradictory, positions on installation charges.  In April 2012, the Taoiseach said:<ul>There will not be an installation charge for the householder because that cost will be covered as a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to the Department.  There will be a cost for the meter itself.<\/ul>An official in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government said the cost of buying and installing water meters will be passed on to households and not paid for by the Exchequer.  He said it will be &quot;similar to how other regulated utilities are funded globally&quot; in so far as &quot;the cost of the meters and the delivery of service will be passed on to the consumers&quot;.  The third and most recently stated position was outlined by the T\u00e1naiste on RTE's &quot;This Week&quot; when he said &quot;No decision has yet been made on how water meters are to be paid for&quot;.  Could the Minister of State clarify the situation?  All of this demonstrates that the initial statements made by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, were clearly lacking any factual basis.  The general uncertainty about a range of matters casts a huge doubt over this entire policy.  The Government has decided to sell part of Bord G\u00e1is \u00c9ireann and, because of its expertise in metering and billing households, to give it responsibility for the new water utility.  Does the Minister of State accept that the public finds it hard not to see this as a key step on the road to privatisation?<\/p><p>  I would like to respond to Senator Landy and his Labour Party colleagues in this House.  I appreciate that they have difficulty with the Bill as it stands.  It requires them to endure yet another U-turn on their pre-election promises to the people of Ireland.  I am sure the Labour Party Senators, including Senator Landy, do not need to be reminded of their pre-election commitments and statements.  However, I would like to put some of them on the record of the House.  The 2011 Labour Party election manifesto stated that &quot;Labour does not favour water charges&quot;.  On 18 February of the same year, the current Minister, Deputy Howlin, said &quot;We are not in favour of water charges&quot;.  On 28 June 2010, the current T\u00e1naiste, Deputy Gilmore, told the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>:<ul>I&#8217;m against water charging.  Water is a necessity.  I&#8217;ve always believed essential services like water should be delivered as a public service.  A flat household charge would be unfair and does not discriminate between houses with five bathrooms or none, and metering is unworkable.<\/ul>Fianna F\u00e1il urges the Government to stop prevaricating and to set out the full cost and implications of its plan for water services.  As I have outlined, we have genuine concerns about the plans for water charges.  We have been told that apartments may be excluded from metering, but we have seen no details about how they will be charged.  We are deeply worried that there is no guarantee on conservation or water infrastructure.  The Government does not appear to have learned the lessons of the household charge fiasco and the septic tank fiasco.  It is rushing ahead with the creation of Irish Water and rolling out water meters without clearly considering the costs involved to consumers.<\/p><p>  I regret that Fianna F\u00e1il will not be in a position to support this Bill on Second Stage.  I note that section 8 of the Bill provides, as the Minister of State said, for the standard prohibitions on Irish Water directors or staff members holding political office at national or European levels.  I hope that does not prevent county councillors from holding directorships.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify whether they will be covered by the prohibition that will apply to national and European politicians.  I hope they will not be excluded.  I accept that my party provided for such a prohibition in the past and that it was wrong to do so.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, to the House once again.  I regret that his senior ministerial colleague has put him out here like a lamb to the slaughter.  He is very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300024#X00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1358949600,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State who is responsible for bringing this Bill through the House today.

It is not just about metering households.  It is about jobs and all of the other things mentioned by the previous speaker.  When the much-coveted foreign direct investors come here, they have an insatiable demand for water.  The Intel plant in County Kildare is an example of that.<\/p> <p>We have to ensure sustainable, high quality water.  As the Minister of State said, it is proposed to transfer from 34 local authorities to a new national water authority.  As I said yesterday when we were talking about functions, we do not need 34 local authorities looking after water that comes out of one tap.  The people want to be assured that the people delivering the water deliver high quality water.  They do not need to know there are 34 local authorities looking after the same thing in 34 different ways.  What they want is satisfaction and a good supply of water coming out of the tap.  If it is not there or there is bad quality, we will hear about it but we will never be asked which one of the 34 delivered it.  If it is delivered well, the consumer will be happy.<\/p><p>I will come to the issue of pricing later.  The efficient, clean, cost effective delivery of water services is the important policy.  There has been historic under-investment in water and ageing and poor quality infrastructure that should have been corrected years ago.  I ask the last speaker to listen to this point.  The leakage in this country is over 50%.  We have spent huge amounts of good money treating water, and it costs more to treat than to deliver the water, yet we then let it run willy-nilly around the place.  As an ex-member of South Dublin County Council, I  am glad to say it was the best performing county council in Ireland for non-leakage from pipes.  I will not mention the worst one, although it was down the country-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300024#X00400","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358950200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>We are up the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300025#Y00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1358950200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>It was not the Senator\u2019s county and I will not shame the county by mentioning it, but there is a league table.

I will deal later with the question of incentives for consumers and problems such as people letting the taps run.<\/p><p>The Minister of State spoke of the job creation element and the people who will be employed, whereas Senator Wilson took up the issue of those who will lose their jobs.  In fact, with regard to the provision of water, it is not the counting of the numbers of people but how the job is done.  We all talk about efficiency and local delivery of local public services.  Numbers are not the only game.  It is important that everybody gets a good job but also that everybody does a good job in the job they are in.

I do not care for introducing this kind of <i>force majeure<\/i> into it.  I have a few comments about the legislation.  In general, it is perfectly appropriate that we pay for what we use.  I hope that payment will be ring fenced and will go back into upgrading the provision of water services.  The management of water resources over many decades by a series of Governments has been completely inadequate.  As a resource, water is certainly one material of which we have an abundance.  One only has to look outside the window of this House almost any day of the week to see that we do not suffer from a lack of rainfall so there is plenty of water.  It just has not been managed appropriately.<\/p><p>  There are two kinds of leaks.  There are leaks on domestic property, which have been emphasised by the Minister of State and other speakers, but there is also the question of leaks on the property of the local authorities, particularly in Dublin.  The mains water supplies in Dublin run under the streets and in some areas, particularly the north inner city, many of these have been left for a considerable number of years without any upgrading.  I remember when they dug up wooden pipes from the 18th century, which is laughable in a capital city.  We need an integrated approach and to look at the problem.  We need to look not just at people in private property but at the responsibilities of the local authorities and whatever water management agency is involved.  <\/p><p>  I have considerable concerns about the fact that there was no proper tendering for this.  This is bad governance.  There is no other word for it because one must leave things over to tender.  It has been boldly stated that Bord G\u00e1is is the best and most expert group but I wonder.  Coincidentally, I received my gas bill today and I have hardly turned the gas on at all.  I got an estimated bill of &#8364;987 or thereabouts.  I do not think I used that amount of gas and would be very surprised if I did.  Grilling a few rashers does not usually come to that amount.  Bord G\u00e1is has difficulty accessing the meter.  It installed it so that is a wonderful and classic example of expertise.  I wonder at its expertise in this area.  <\/p><p>  Bord G\u00e1is will franchise out the installation of the meters.  This is fair enough but I hope there will be a bit of quality control because it is very important that the contractors involved in this process have the correct skills.  I am speaking from a slightly parochial point of view but this is particularly important in areas of classical Georgian Dublin.  For example, it is very important that the 18th century hand-turned granite pavings sets should be maintained.  This has almost never happened.  In particular, when it is franchised out, everybody denies any responsibility for it.  When one has entire streets listed in the public interest, very particular care should be taken to ensure that this part of our heritage is not destroyed.  It is not something that immediately strikes the average person as being an important part of our heritage.  It is not like a painting in the National Gallery but it is significant and part of the integrity of what remains of the 18th-century city.<\/p><p>  In respect of Bord G\u00e1is, metering and pavements, Bord G\u00e1is was appointed without tender because of its alleged expertise, of which I have yet to be convinced.  If it is going to do it, why in the name of God does it not take the opportunity to install proper gas meters at the same time?  Will there ever be joined-up metering?  It is in the same area as the ESB.  One of the things I like about these water meters is the fact that we are told they can be read electronically.  This is brilliant and superb as the owner does not have to be disturbed and one does not have to be in or get these idiotic notices where the date is never filled in and which have a box that does not tally with the number on one's box.  I am all in favour of that.  Instead of digging up the streets three times, why does it not dig them up once so there can be some kind of universal metering and the same machine can read electricity, gas and water meters?  I know this might be a slightly adventurous step but in the long run, it saves money, helps create jobs and shows an intelligent approach.  If we are moving in this direction and this is the future, why limp along one step at a time and do water today, gas tomorrow and electricity the day after and dig up the streets all over again half a dozen times?  I suggest that we look and see if it is not possible to do this.  <\/p><p>  I gather the installation of the meters is going to tender so at least one element is being tendered for appropriately.  Again, I hope we have some expertise in this area because I hate to think that some continental engineering company would unload a collection of dross on us and we would have a system like that which pertained to the e-voting machines and have to pay for the warehousing of a few million water meters.  I agree with the previous speaker who instanced situations where there were different kinds of charges all over the country for various kinds of meters.  If we are buying in bulk from a supplier, and I presume we will buy the same machines from one single supplier which may or may not subcontract, I hope that we use every ounce of our muscle to get a bargain price for those meters because it will be a significant contract for whatever company or group gets it.  We should ensure we use this lever of bulk buying to say we want meters of real quality at a good price.  <\/p><p>  What happens if the meters fail due to weather conditions, be they flooding which would be ironic but possible, or frost?  Who is responsible?  Are we going to hit the householder again?  I daresay I will be able to pay for it and am very happy to do so in the same way I would be happy to pay bin charges if we had any decent bin companies.  I greatly regret that some local authorities were permitted to privatise these services because it has been a 100% disaster.  I hope we can get some clarity with regard to who must pay for any repairs.  The point I was getting to was slightly different.  In the current economic situation, there may be people who are being hit repeatedly, including by the property tax and the second home tax, which will not affect the poorest people or me.  I wonder how on earth people in mortgage arrears who are hit by more and more bills are going to keep paying.  Every week, we come into this House and there is another &#8364;200 or &#8364;100 being put onto household bills.  We may be lucky because we have reasonable incomes although I am sure some Members are under pressure because they have made commitments before.  We should not exempt ourselves and say that we do not suffer anything.  There are Members in both Houses who are put to the pin of their collar because they gave commitments during the good days but what about the people out there? <\/p> <p>Can they afford it and what will happen if they cannot?  For example, will there be a proposal to cut them off? The Minister of State is shaking his head, which I hope can be translated into a \"No\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300026#Z00200","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358951400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>It is not the intention to cut anybody off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300027#AA00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1358951400,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his courtesy and for putting that on the record.

Today the Minister of State confirmed to us the retention of staff within the local authority system up to 2017.  I will ask for their retention beyond that date.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Wilson's party for its past ability to put EU Structural Funds to good use in upgrading water treatment plants throughout the country over many years.  In my town raw sewage used to flow into the river at five different points but in recent years we have had a full new water system that sends back crystal clear water to the River Suir.  This is a perfect example of what the country has achieved and strives to continue to achieve.  The availability of good quality water is a driver of job creation.  We saw that only yesterday with the agreement of an extension on the part of Intel.  We have seen it in the food and drinks sector and in the biopharmacy area.<\/p><p>Why are we where we are today?  We are there because under the EU-IMF financial support package this country was required to charge for water and a charging system had to be introduced.  Again, I must remind my learned colleague of this because he seems to have an amnesiac tendency in this area.  It is like saying that although one has signed up to buy a car when it is delivered, one will not pay for it because one does not like the smell of the air freshener inside.

It is good from the point of view of conservation and best use of water.  It will create a different mindset in this country towards the valuable asset of water.  For too long water has been wasted and there has been no regard for the cost of providing water.  In my town alone, which has an annual budget of \u20ac5 million, the cost per annum of water provision is \u20ac900,000, or 18% of the annual budget.  That cost must be realised and the money must be found.  We signed up to the troika and agreed to charge for water and must proceed with that.<\/p><p>I welcome the comments of the Minister of State.  I have had previous interaction with him and discussions at committee level on the staff in local authorities which is a matter of great concern to me.  I welcome that he has set up a consultative group, which is a very good approach to the issue.  I welcome that staff have job security until 2017.  What will happen after that date?<\/p><p>The Bill to transfer assets is separate and will follow this legislation.  Does this mean that all services, land rights access, use of bore holes, etc., for which local authorities have signed agreements in order that the new legislation can be implemented, will have to be negotiated with individual landowners?  That is a very important issue throughout rural Ireland because there are many kinds of individual arrangements, agreements and legal contracts in place.  That must be clarified.<\/p><p>Will the new water company, Uisce \u00c9ireann or Water Ireland, be accountable to the elected members of local authorities?  Will the company report annually to the local authorities and provide direct responses to representations made by local elected members?  Will company representatives be available to discuss the infrastructural needs of individual local authorities and their districts?

Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire.<\/p><p>  The Water Services Bill 2013 under discussion here today is to be commended as a first step in an attempt to deal with several key areas that have required urgent attention for a number of years.  It is in line with the EU Water Framework Directive 2000, which aims to promote sustainable water use based on the long-term protection of available water resources, and is a key driver of water legislation in Ireland and across the EU.  The main objectives of the directive are to achieve a good level of water quality by 2015.<\/p><p>  Ever since the abolition of water charges by a coalition Government in 1996 the OECD, the ESRI, the Commission on Taxation and other organisations, have urged their reinstatement in some form.  Indeed we are all aware of the need to engage with the search for a more efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable system of water conservation and treatment in our country.<\/p><p>  Most especially however, given the current economic climate, priority must be given to achieving these goals in a way that is socially just and equitable.  There are three areas of concern to which I would draw the Minister's attention.  First, the consequences for social justice which the creation of Irish Water by the Bill provides for, in particular how it proposes to determine and collect payment for services through the installation of a metering system.  The Minister is no doubt aware that several models of payment were proposed in the position paper of January last year from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The system of metering is to its credit a fair and sustainable method with significant advantages over the other models proposed.  That can only be the case if the necessary safeguards are in place such as those found in the UK, for example, where low income metered customers with a high essential use of water receive support from a special &quot;watersure&quot; tariff.  This caps the bills of metered households, particularly those in receipt of a qualifying means-tested benefit or tax credit at the level of the average bill for the company's operating area where the household either has three or more children living at home under the age of 19 or somebody in the household has a medical condition which necessitates a high essential use of water.<\/p><p>  Although the programme for Government proposes a similar safeguard where water charges are to be based on usage &quot;above a free allowance&quot;, no decision has yet been taken on the level of allowance to be provided and how it will be funded.  I would suggest that there is a certain urgency to this decision being made given the cost will be in the region of &#8364;1 billion, a cost that will now be transferred directly to Irish householders who are already struggling to meet day-to-day living costs, as other Members have stated.<\/p><p>  The Bill in its provision for the creation of Irish Water does so by eliminating the role of local authorities which have heretofore provided services relating to water charges and aims instead to centralise this process.  This has the potential to further erode confidence in local democratic institutions.  An excellent and cogent submission on this issue was made by Galway County Council to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In arguing its case Galway County Council stated: &quot;The council is of the view that the proposal will seriously undermine the local government system of which water services are a significant component and have a negative impact generally on local representation and accountability&quot;.  In its submission to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government the body makes the following points: locally-elected representatives will no longer have a role in water services provision, operation and management, further eroding the local government system and the principles of local representation; the role of Galway County Council in relation to planning and economic development will be seriously undermined unless it can retain a meaningful influence on decision making with regard to allocation of water service resources; and economic development will suffer if the infrastructural needs of local authorities are not only fully recognised but satisfactorily addressed.<\/p><p>  All of these points could be equally made by other local authorities around the country, especially if we keep in mind the recent chaos surrounding the attempt to centralise the student grant system under SUSI, which like this Water Services Bill was designed with the aim of &quot;supervising and accelerating&quot; the State's delivery of a service.<\/p><p>  The Bill is clearly the proposed legislative instrument which will give effect to the sense of urgency contained in the above mentioned 2012 position paper.  However, many of the predicates which underlie that paper and indeed the other significant document which has informed this discussion, the 2008 Forf\u00e1s document &quot;Assessment of Water and Waste Water Services for Enterprise&quot;, have either been superseded by economic realities or are now hypothetical at best.  For example, the 2008 Forf\u00e1s document envisioned continued and rapid expansion of enterprise and urban settlement that would be heavily reliant on water well in to the future.  Whatever else we may say it is highly unlikely this country will either need or require the amount of housing and thus water delivery services that was then predicted, and cited approvingly in the 2012 position paper.<\/p><p>  Indeed Forf\u00e1s itself in stating its methodological approach acknowledges that the model upon which the sense of urgency surrounding the delivery of water services is built is based on a number of key assumptions, such as the CSO's forecasts for population growth, the level of water demand <i>per capita <\/i>and current and future enterprise development, all of which must be scaled back given the new reality we find ourselves in.  This gives us a measure of breathing space.<\/p><p>  I welcome the Bill and share the Government's commitment to realise its key objectives to maximise value for money and to facilitate the scope for the participation of SMEs in the overall programme.  Even if I have reservations about the authority under which such metering will reside, I welcome and share in the commitment to an environmentally sustainable solution, which can only benefit everybody.<\/p><p>  I welcome and share the commitment to use one of our most plentiful natural resources to place us in a position of strategic importance in regard to industry and enterprise.  I hope we can keep in mind the broader concerns for our greatest resource of all, namely, the people.

One pays on the basis of the exact usage.  Those who use the most water will obviously pay more.<\/p> <p>Other Senators have mentioned that it will identify the locations of serious leaks in fields or farms and people will soon want to know why their water charges are so exorbitant.  Mary Jo down the road with a house and family of the same size will discover leaks.  I previously worked in the ESB and customers were given every opportunity to pay outstanding bills such as by means of deferred payments.  Disconnection was regarded as a last resort.  One can do without electricity by using a gas cooker or a Tilly lamp but one will not put up with this for too long.  However, what will happen when a householder fails to pay the metered charge for water?  I can envisage a house without an electricity supply, but I cannot envisage a household without a water supply for any length of time.  Is it a case of going back to having a well or a toilet at the bottom of the garden?  It costs \u20ac1 a day for the average household, which is great value for money.  This is great value for a commodity that takes an amount of money to produce.<\/p><p>The point about refusing access to the property to the person installing a water meter was referred to by Senator Denis Landy.  Is there wayleave to install a meter on private property?  I understand the fine for barring access could amount to \u20ac5,000.  I hope this will not arise too frequently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300028#BB00700","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358952600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Water charges are not something new as a subject for political discourse or debate.  It is not a subject that fell into the lap of the Government as part of the discussions between Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The previous Government signed up to the national recovery plan for the period 2011 to 2015 which envisaged the introduction of water charges.  The Government is adopting and implementing these policies with the support of the troika.  <\/p><p>The context is very important.  People in this state are now paying more taxes than ever before.  Over the course of the past five budgets they have been hit with pay cuts and more taxes, both direct and indirect.  They have seen their income cut through pay cuts, especially those in the public and private sectors.  The universal social charge has had a big impact on many families.  At the time the Minister of State's party said it was a bad idea, but the charge was not reversed.  In fact, a raft of new charges were placed on top of the universal social charge.  The property tax has now been introduced and people are being asked to pay, on average, between \u20ac300 and \u20ac500.  As if that is not enough, the Government is introducing water charges for householders.  I do not think it understands how difficult it is for many families to pay all of these bills.  <\/p><p>We are moving to a very cumbersome and bureaucratic system in how services are to be funded.  It is also a very right-wing way, an aspect I will deal with.  Everything is to be paid separately and ability to pay is not being considered, nor is social solidarity.  It is a case of pay as you go and pay as you use.  This is Margaret Thatcher's policy being delivered by the two Government parties.  On top of water charges, people will also pay separately for school books and school transport and for their waste to be collected.  They are being asked to pay a property tax.  If everything else is being paid for separately, what is this for?  They are paying more in income tax than ever before, but they are being told that the money raised is no longer to be used to pay for water or local government services which must be paid for separately.  The Government is under-estimating the strength of opposition to the family home tax and water charges.  This is a matter it will need to consider.<\/p><p>Senator Terry Brennan made the point that the fairest way to charge for water was on the basis of water usage.  Let us test that theory.  Is it fair that a big family on a low income must pay the same amount as a small family on a high income for using the same amount of water?  I do not believe it is.  Water is a precious commodity, the provision of which should be funded through general taxation.  People should not be asked to pay on the basis of what they use.  When one follows the logic of that argument, wealthy people will pay exactly the same amount as everybody else for all of these services.  A reduction in income tax for the wealthy means they will not pay what they should be paying and we all end up paying the same amount as wealthy individuals, even though the Government has not asked any of them to pay his or her fair share.  The Government parties will be back on the doorsteps at the next general election and I am sure these issues will ring very loudly in their ears when they knock on doors and have to explain why that is the case.

We will see an upsurge in vigilantism in some parts of the country with people believing they must take the law into their own hands to protect their communities.

Fianna F\u00e1il would argue strongly against the devastating blow to the security infrastructure of the State.  The underhanded reduction in the force to an abysmal low of 12,000 Garda members, combined with the jaw-dropping closure of over 100 Garda stations is nothing less than an attack on the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  At the same time, we have an increase in burglaries, drug smuggling and serious dissident activity.  The Government is going way beyond the EU-IMF agreement in slashing Garda numbers to their lowest level in over a decade and in dismantling the security infrastructure of the State by closing Garda stations across the country.  Fianna F\u00e1il has put forward a fully-costed alternative budget proposal that reopens Templemore to allow for Garda recruitment and keeps rural Garda stations open.  Instead, criminals will be toasting the Minister's decision to dismantle the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.<\/p><p>I wish to focus on the set up and the difficulties in rural Ireland, even though this is a motion that embraces communities in both rural and urban Ireland.  In the Mizen Head Peninsula, for example, where I live, Goleen Garda station, which is one of the most remote in Ireland, has been closed.  The Minister has forgotten that three or four years ago an attempt was made to land one of the biggest shipments of drugs near Goleen and it was the local garda\u00ed who apprehended the felons, who are now serving long sentences in Portlaoise Prison.  Ballydehob Garda station on the same peninsula has been disabled and two banks on the peninsula at Ballydehob and Schull have been closed down.  The peninsula is also on record as having the oldest population profile of any rural area, bar one community in Donegal which the Minister of State represents.  It is also regrettable that in the last 12 months we have lost the Cork to Swansea ferry, which is having a very negative impact on people in west Cork who want to travel to and from the UK and on tourism in the area.  Furthermore, Cork Airport has lost approximately one third of its flights in recent times, which is hugely damaging to the community.  <\/p><p>The proposal by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to transfer the responsibilities of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners to the Cork Port Authority is something which I vehemently opposed in this House.  I succeeded in deferring this when it was proposed by the former Fianna F\u00e1il Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when I spoke for approximately four and a half hours in this House on this matter.  <\/p><p>I have great respect for the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, and my remarks are not directed at him.  He has a great love, respect and, indeed, gr\u00e1 for rural Ireland.  The threatened closure of many rural schools is another difficulty, as is the slow roll-out of broadband in many of the schools in west Cork.  Another enormous problem is the mass emigration from our shores, which has probably never been as intense as it is at present.  If one combines all of these elements, one paints a very dismal picture of the fate of rural Ireland going forward.  I know of several GAA clubs in my own area where problems have arisen because of emigration.  Gabriel Rangers, which is based in the Schull area won the west Cork junior football final two years ago for the first time in its history but a shopkeeper told me recently that 18 of the panel of 33 have now left Ireland, a situation that is replicated in many other areas.  I am not saying that this is all the fault of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am simply giving the House an overview of where we stand in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>At an Oireachtas committee meeting recently, attended by the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, I focused in particular on the closure of rural Garda stations.  Senator Whelan made a comment to the effect that they are just buildings but if there are no garda\u00ed or buildings in places like Goleen, which is 40 miles away from the nearest large town, it indicates a lack of status for such places and provokes fear among locals that their local garda is gone for good and glory.  When I questioned the Commissioner at that meeting he told me that, in his view, the closure of rural Garda stations was not an economic issue and that little or no savings would be made in that regard.  That must be put on record.  The reduction in Garda numbers is an issue of major concern, particularly when one bears in mind that approximately 2,000 members of the force are engaged in administrative duties.  A total of six or seven Garda stations in my constituency have been closed.  The fact that these were the most rural of stations in the area, which were serving an active community, is a matter of grave concern.  <\/p><p>I mentioned the closure of the banks earlier.  When banks close in areas which have large numbers of elderly people, some of whom do not have cars or access to decent public transport, many of them are inclined to keep money at home.  The professional burglars out there who are staking out rural communities and individual houses are well aware of the fact that people are keeping money at home.  <\/p> <p>Will it be the case that whatever it costs to rectify all the leaking pipes and bad piping, people will have to pay for it?  When will we have an indication about the amount of money needed and what it will cost users?  It is important that people know that.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane said his piece and ran out the door.  To a degree there is something in what he said with regard to large families and low incomes and small families and large incomes.  Perhaps some mechanism could be put in place such as an allowance for larger families which they could use first and which would be free.  There may be scope for something similar to what is in place for farmers whereby farms receive X amount of water for domestic usage for free and after that they are charged.  Some of these things should be examined.<\/p><p>I will conclude by talking to my good friend, Senator Wilson.  He seems to have a remarkably short memory, as pointed out by Senator Landy, because Fianna F\u00e1il signed up for water charges with the troika.  I imagine the party's supporters have forgotten the damage that it has done by now.  I remind Senator Wilson of one debate we had on the budget-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300030#JJ00400","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358953200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I imagine Labour Party supporters have not forgotten what it promised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300030#DD00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1358953200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Senator Kelly, without interruption.

Instead, the operation is being given to a semi-State body, which will probably be a private entity in future, Bord G\u00e1is \u00c9ireann, without any real tendering process.  It was only a question of whether it would be Bord G\u00e1is or Bord na M\u00f3na.  I have grave concerns for the future and for how this will impact on people who work every day of the week in local authorities and who do a really good job.<\/p><p>I understand there have been three bursts of water pipes in Fingal and these problems are continuing as we speak.  We regularly receive e-mails with such news.  We know the infrastructure is poor in many places.  We have seen improvements in recent years, including up to this winter, whereby main trunk water mains are being replaced in conjunction with other works taking place and that is sensible.  I hope I will be proven wrong because water is a valuable resource for all of us and it is important that we get it right, but I do not have confidence in how we will manage the transition and ensure that we upgrade our fresh water system to the point where it should be.<\/p><p>There are issues with regard to the costs of the installation of the meters.  We were informed at the start that the consumer and the public would not be paying for the installation.  Then we learned that they would be paying by way of a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund in the region of \u20ac450 million, which would be charged at interest over 20 years at approximately \u20ac40 per annum.  Effectively this will amount to a cost of \u20ac340 to the consumer.  Consumers will be paying for water, which they did not have to pay for previously and now, as I understand it, they will also be paying for the installation of the meters with an interest rate charged as well.  That is not equitable or fair.  Before that is introduced the Government must provide absolute clarity on the degree of free water usage and this should be done on a per person per household basis.  It should take into account the demographics within each household as well.  If there are young children in a household it will use more water; this depends on age groups in certain households.<\/p><p>This needs to be worked out and it cannot be rushed and that is our problem with the Bill.  The Minister of State holds a different view and I respect that.  We need to consider whether we are rushing ahead with this.  If we start on the basis that we will not get metering right at the beginning then public confidence will be lost.  Those are some of the questions I have put to the Minister of State I know he will answer them and I appreciate that.<\/p><p>With the indulgence of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I call on the Minister of State to examine the tendering process for the installation of water meters.  There is a real concern that the small and medium-sized Irish business sector will be bounced out of this process.  I have already received complaints about the pre-tendering qualification stage because of the level of turnover required for a tendering business.  If we are serious about using this exercise to create 2,000 jobs, do we want to give those jobs to the large organisations?  Should we not give them to the local businesses that are well trained to do the work and that can do it?  I call on the Minister of State to examine the levels of turnover set down for businesses to tender for jobs that we all know they can do.  I would be far happier, as would Senator Landy, for a business in Carrick-on-Suir to get the job to carry out the work in that area or for a business in Swords which has the expertise to get it for the surrounding area there.  I do not want a large foreign conglomerate to come in and install all of these meters and I call on the Minister of State to examine that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300030#DD02900","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1358953200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I extend my welcome to the Minister of State.  This is very important and I support the setting up of the new water authority.  Many questions have been asked and we have dealt with them thus far.  Local people are working with local authorities at the moment and some of them are concerned about their jobs.  Will their jobs be maintained and will they be kept on by the local authority, or will they be working for the new board?  Clarity for these people is important.<\/p> <p> It is also very important to use local contractors and subcontractors - local people with local knowledge - to install meters, a matter touched on by my colleagues.  In many cases, such persons have already installed some of the systems and pipework to be used.  It is important to keep them in the loop.  If we are to create 2,000 jobs, it is important to keep as many of them as possible in local areas.  Problems arose in the past, particularly in Border areas, when people from outside the State came into local authorities and sublet some of the work to local people.  They skipped off before the job was finished without paying the local subcontractor.  I have raised a number of such cases in the House.  We must be careful not to allow this to happen in the future.<\/p><p>I understand the current free usage allowance is 50,000 gallons.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to examine the limit as it applies to families, particularly those on low incomes, for whom we should do something.<\/p><p>A point was made about the importance of not having to dig up the road a number of times when one is doing a job.  When works are being done on the roadway, the opportunity should be taken to inspect the water system and make sure it is being looked after.<\/p><p>Problems may be encountered by farmers who have several plots of land and are paying for several meters.  I suggest there be a single universal charge for farmers.  The north-south and east-west variations are unfair.

We accept the inevitable principle that it will happen.  I am surprised, however, especially in the light of yesterday's debate on local government reform, that there has been so little discussion on the Government side of the Government's concept of establishing a separate water authority.  I fail to understand why this and the previous Government seem to have engaged in a headlong rush to remove powers from politicians at local and national level.  They have chosen to establish quangos at arm's length from the Government, only to find that such bodies have very little accountability.  Like Senator Darragh O'Brien, I firmly believe it is inevitable that a future Government will decide to put the water authority up for sale.

This requirement has already been established on both sides of the House.  The Minister of State is operating in an environment in which people are totally unused to paying for water.  A massive cultural change will take place when the people are asked to pay water charges for the first time ever.  There is a large rural population outside the major cities.  For such people, paying for water used to be the last thing on their minds.  I cannot help reflecting on a comment made some time ago.  I used to follow the mantra that water was a finite resource until a scientist pointed out that this country's rainfall levels meant it was not a finite resource.  There is water in abundance at all times of the year.  I am not sure Senator Michael Comiskey will agree with my view that farmers will start to increase their use of rainwater.  The accumulation of rainwater, in order to cut down on paid usage, will be in vogue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300031#EE00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1358953800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>That makes sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300031#EE00500","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1358953800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>It is interesting that as technology develops, people will be able to harvest more and more rainwater in order to cut costs.  Perhaps the Minister of State has a view on this.  I am concerned about what will happen when charges are eventually imposed on the most vulnerable.  It is only right and proper that everybody - Government and Opposition alike - accept and acknowledge that the increased level of taxation being imposed will reach breaking point at some stage, to the extent that people will say \"enough is enough.\"  I hope the timeline the Government has outlined for reaching its budgetary and fiscal targets will be adhered to in the interests of the country and social cohesion.  My personal opinion which I have no evidence to support is that this will be a \"make or break\" year.  The general population will accept the taxation measures outlined in the budget last month, but if the Government provides for a similar level of austerity this time next year, we will reach an impasse and may experience serious social breakdown in certain key areas.  While I do not want to be a prophet of doom, I must emphasise that the effectiveness of the water authority will hinge on the level of trust between the Government and the people.  Will it be more effective than what the local authorities are offering?<\/p><p>Questions have been raised about the transfer of power.  I have spoken to people in local authorities who have said it is inevitable that the people currently operating the water regime in local authority areas will operate it under the new water authority.  That issue must be addressed.  While the installation of meters and the imposition of charges are of critical importance, the first priority will be the cultivation of the resource.  As the Minister of State has said repeatedly, leakages in the system have reached unacceptably high levels.  I would like to receive an assurance that this will be a major priority for the new authority.  There are concerns about whether the necessary investment will be provided for.  It is a matter of trust between the Government and the people.  Will sufficient resources be provided to address that issue?  It is going to be a problem.  When people receive their bills at the end of each month, having been told by the media that millions of gallons of water are being wasted, that will also have an impact on the level of trust.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300031#EE00600","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1358953800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.

As I have said for some time, the Water Services Bill 2013 is one of the most significant, strategic and substantial Bills that will be dealt with by this House and the D\u00e1il in the current term.  It is just as important as the financial legislation with which we will have to deal.<\/p><p>An Bord Plean\u00e1la saw fit yesterday to grant planning permission for the next phase of the expansion and development of Intel.  The safety, security and sustainability of a reliable water supply was one of the key factors the board considered in granting planning permission.  Intel and other similar institutions use thousands of litres of water in their factories and plants on a daily and weekly basis.  This is part of the strategic planning of international companies.  We are competing with countries such as Scotland and Israel for investment and job creation of this nature.  As part of the planning conditions, Intel has agreed to pay \u20ac21 million, a significant sum, to Kildare County Council for the supply of water.  To date, Intel has invested at least \u20ac7.5 billion in its Leixlip installation which currently employs 4,500 people.  That is what we are talking about when we have a debate on water supply.<\/p><p>Over 30 years ago everyone thought the idea proposed by a young man who appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was crazy.  I refer to the proposal made by Mr. Geoff Read to sell water to people in bottles.<\/p> <p>At the time they thought it was a laughing matter, but, of course, we are talking about the founder of Ballygowan who was before his time and, as they say, the rest is history.  Who would have thought that was possible in this country where it never seems to stop raining?  We are fortunate to have a supply of largely clean and reliable fresh water in our taps, of which we think nothing and which, in fact, we take for granted.<\/p><p>I am not sure what the charge will be for water when meters are installed.  I accept, however, that any new bill coming through the door of any household will be an additional burden and that no one wants to see extra charges and bills because, ultimately, people see the charge as a tax.  Whether it is, it will certainly be a burden on families and households.  However, as other speakers said, most reasonable people say it is not unfair or inequitable to pay, let me suggest, \u20ac1 a day to be sure of a supply of clean fresh water to meet all household needs.  This goes way beyond that, however, as the Minister of State knows, because we are also looking at the commercial, industrial and agricultural implications, as mentioned by other colleagues.  Even though there is an abundance of rain, this does not equate with having an abundance of useable drinking water and water suitable for use by pharmaceutical companies, restaurants and other businesses such as agricultural processing and so on.<\/p><p>I take the opportunity to remind the Minister of State, as I have in the past, that it was in 1940 the Poulaphouca reservoir was built to supply water to the city of Dublin.  However, although construction started in 1940, it was 1947 before a single drop of water became available to the city.  That is the lead-in time at which we are looking.  With no disrespect to anyone, we are putting the cart before the horse in talking about charging for water, installing meters and developing the water infrastructure when we have not built the necessary reservoirs and infrastructure to make sure we will have the water to supply.<\/p><p>I highlight for the Minister of State the need to expedite and for him to intervene in this issue personally, as I know he is committed to the project of building the Bord na M\u00f3na reservoir at Garryhinch in the midlands to supply water to Dublin and the greater Leinster region.  I would not countenance for one second supporting a proposal that would be ecologically or environmentally unsound or unsafe; in fact, I would vehemently oppose such a suggestion.  I am certain, however, given the available data and evidence to date, that it is possible, safe, secure and sustainable - economically, ecologically and environmentally - to abstract water from the Shannon basin at a rate of between 2% and 4% and supply it to the greater Leinster region.  I remind the House that the River Shannon is in flood for 80% of the year.<\/p><p>How much time do I have left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300031#EE01300","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358954400,"counter":241,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300032#FF00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1358954400,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I will draw to a conclusion because I know the Minister of State has to leave and we will resume the debate on Thursday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300032#FF00300","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1358954400,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I hate to stop the Senator in full flow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300032#FF00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1358954400,"counter":244,"content":"<p>That is a watery comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300032#FF00500","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1358954400,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I want to make one further point.

and <br \/>&#8212; calls on the Government to support the development of initiatives to improve the quality of life.  <\/ul><\/ul>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs to the House and look forward to an interaction with him on this issue.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion this evening.  The quality of life for all our citizens in all communities is a very important issue.  This motion aims to ensure the Government remains steadfast in its efforts to support the front-line services and the development of initiatives that improve the quality of life for communities in urban and rural areas.  It also addresses how community policing plays a vital role in making communities safe and secure.  I commend the efforts of the Government so far to protect frontline services across the public sector.  I particularly welcome the efforts of the Minister for Justice and Equality efforts to keep the thin blue line from becoming thinner when he confirmed there was no possibility of the force losing 1,500 garda\u00ed this year, as was reported in some quarters.  <\/p><p>  My colleagues will speak on other matters pertaining to this motion but I will focus on the protection and support of community initiatives.  These initiatives give people on the ground a voice and platform to raise their concerns and have them listened to.  A well-resourced Garda presence is the backbone of every healthy and vibrant town or community.  In October 2012, 170 new vehicles were purchased by an Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na costing &#8364;3 million.  This is a substantial investment in the Garda fleet and will include mostly patrol cars as well as some unmarked cars and vans.  It is a welcome investment and I hope this addition to the fleet will be spread out evenly across the country.  <\/p><p>  Rural Ireland faces many difficulties.  Some of them have been well represented by organisations such as Irish Rural Link which questions the Garda's ability to carry out their role in rural communities as they have done for many years.  These difficulties have led to a rise in the number of crimes in rural Ireland.  We now see the theft from isolated houses of things like valuable metals, oil and diesel.  There may be a perception among some criminals that rural Ireland is a soft touch.  We need to work immediately on killing that perception and ensuring that people living in isolated areas in rural Ireland can feel safe in their homes.  A great way of doing this is catching the criminal red-handed.  I am glad to say that in my own area of Carrick-on-Suir, a spate of recent home heating oil thefts has been curbed by the local garda\u00ed and a conviction for one of those apprehended has been achieved.  There is nothing like a headline in a newspaper for deterring criminals from carrying out activities.  <\/p><p>  In respect of preserving numbers in An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, openly admitted to the Oireachtas that he does not want Garda numbers to drop below 13,000.  The Garda Representative Association says that any cuts to front-line services would be &quot;reckless endangerment&quot;.  The Government is very cognisant of this which is why I welcome the statement by the Minister for Justice, Defence and Equality about maintaining as many garda\u00ed as possible in rural and urban Ireland.<\/p><p>  A number of initiatives have been put in place over many years, particularly in the past number of years.  I have been involved in these in my community.  Neighbourhood Watch has been set up in many locations across the country, while Community Alert has been set up in rural areas.  These two initiatives have been supported by the garda\u00ed and Muintir na T\u00edre has also had an input into them.  They aim to improve community safety, prevent crime, develop Garda and community links, increase public confidence in An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, foster a caring environment for older and vulnerable people and reduce antisocial behaviour, including graffiti and harassment.  These schemes have worked in rural Ireland but there is a need to re-energise these organisations.  As in any walk of life, organisations set up many years ago tend to fall away.<\/p>I will be brief as I know that the Minister of State is under pressure because he has to attend another event, at least he indicated to me that he was.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy McGinley, for his response to this motion.  This debate and motion provided an opportunity for us within the Labour group and our colleagues in Fine Gael to bring forward several issues of concern to us and to get clarity on how the Government is addressing these issues.  I feel confident that as a result of the response from the Minister of State we will see positive responses.<\/p> <p>At a time when crime in rural Ireland is becoming a major issue, however, I ask that resources be provided to local communities to upgrade these organisations and give them a fresh start.  Another initiative in place in both cities and rural areas is the joint policing committees which were established under An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Act 2005 and set up in 2006 in 114 local authorities throughout the State.  They have their own distinct perspective and input in every local authority area.  The Garda has adopted a proactive approach in developing and maintaining links with the key stakeholders.  The participants include the chairperson of the local authority, a Garda-nominated officer, local authority members, Members of the Oireachtas for the area and community and voluntary sector representatives.  The relevance of the joint policing committees cannot be overestimated.  They work closely with the communities they represent and bring forward many initiatives which help both to stem crime and create community involvement.<\/p><p>There is no point in saying otherwise but the current crime figures in rural Ireland suggest we are in a difficult place.  An initiative introduced some years ago, Operation Fiacla, was established in response to an increase of 40% in burglaries in some parts of the country.  At the time the GRA pointed out this increase and the need for resources for garda\u00ed in rural areas.  The operation was very successful, with 3,500 suspects arrested for crimes throughout the State of whom, to date, 1,400 have been charged.  I call for further resources to be supplied for a new operation that would ensure that elderly people in isolated areas can feel safe in their communities and not be afraid to answer their front doors.  I understand Garda numbers and districts have been realigned across the country but there are garda\u00ed in rural Ireland.  I would like to see these officers working on a day-to-day basis with the communities where they are based, through organisations such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.  Even in a time of Government cutbacks it cannot be the case that people living in rural Ireland must go to bed with the fear of being attacked, their house being broken into or their heating oil or various other items being stolen at will.  This motion, although it commends the Government for the work done to date, calls for further action and for an initiative or operation throughout the country that will meet head-on the issue of burglaries and robberies in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300033#GG00200","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358955600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, to the House.

It applies also to the Adjournment debate where the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has delegated other Ministers and does so on an ongoing basis.  I am uncomfortable with that.  I would prefer if the Minister attended to hear our concerns directly.<\/p><p>  This motion is timely although it had its genesis some months ago when the Labour Party Seanad group first suggested it.  It was deferred over Christmas yet in the current climate it is not only topical but pertinent.  Unfortunately, the need for such a motion was brought home to us yet again during the Christmas and new year period when, in rural areas in particular, elderly people in isolated areas found themselves exposed and vulnerable to unscrupulous people who take advantage of them and bring terror into their lives.  I cannot imagine what it would be like to have this happen to a family member or somebody in one's own area. <\/p><p>  However, it is not a rural issue only and applies also in large urban centres.  To be fair to the Seanad, on a number of occasions we highlighted serious crime issues, attacks and assaults in Dublin city, some occurring in broad daylight and on main thoroughfares.  Some of these attacks resulted in deaths.  A former journalist colleague was a victim of one such attack.  We cannot be complacent and say we are comfortable, that we are doing the right thing and our policy is intact, if people are unsafe in their own homes and on the main streets of our towns and cities.  I brought this issue up before Christmas, noting that people were afraid to walk and do their shopping in broad daylight on the main street of Mountmellick.  This is not acceptable.  To be fair, considerable resources have been made available, as Senator Landy pointed out, for a new fleet of up to 200 Garda patrol cars.  When will these be despatched?  We were told they would be commissioned in January but I have not seen any of them on the streets of Laois-Offaly.  I would like to see them out and about at the earliest possible time.<\/p><p>  I have done some research with Garda colleagues and retired garda\u00ed on the issue of the closure of stations.  It is not about trying to retain the building <i>per se<\/i> for the sole purpose of having it in place with one garda attached to it.  However, there is a problem if that garda is lost to the force or if a level of manpower is lost in that area or redeployed elsewhere, leaving entire swathes without Garda cover.  One of the mistakes we made was to close the Garda Training College in Templemore - I cannot understand how we will have adequate policing into the future.  The answer is not to shorten the time in which training takes places.  I saw it mooted that when the college reopens the training period should be reduced from two years.  That would be a mistake.  We need new garda\u00ed and new blood within the force but it is important that they are properly resourced and trained.  It would be unwise to fast-track that training.<\/p><p>  I have another suggestion for the Minister of State.  Up to ten years ago members of the Defence Forces were able to transfer to other sections within the Department of Defence, such as the Prison Service or the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, seamlessly, without any loss of service.  They had to be properly trained, of course.  That is something we should explore.  I am sure there are many members of the Defence Forces who might like to take up the opportunity to transfer to the Garda and this would help to shore up Garda numbers at a time when, as Senator Landy pointed out, there will not be adequate policing if we allow the number to drop much further.  People are reassured by Garda presence and visibility in patrols.  I welcome the announcement, made by the Minister, to be fair, that part of the new policy and strategy will be to redeploy Garda resources to ensure there is more adequate patrolling and more significant policing on the streets.  One could go for weeks on end in towns in the country and not meet a garda on the beat, as traditionally one used to. <\/p> <p>It is very important that people are reassured during the day and, more importantly, at night.  It is also important that garda\u00ed are in a position to increase their local knowledge through interfacing with the community and developing good relationships which, in turn, leads to crime prevention.<\/p><p>At the moment, there is no doubt that many parts of rural Ireland are soft targets for roaming gangs who know that Garda resources are stretched to the limit and that the response time is inadequate.  Such gangs often set up decoys to distract the garda\u00ed.  They draw the patrol car to one area while they carry out their dirty deeds elsewhere and rain terror down on elderly people, in particular, living in isolated areas.  <\/p><p>Like Senator Landy, I commend the work of Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert schemes throughout the country.  They serve a useful purpose as I know well from my own area - the schemes in Timahoe and Ratheniska work very well and are a source of comfort to people.  I must also commend the garda\u00ed who were involved in setting up such schemes, many of whom are now retired.  However, they must be underpinned by an adequate Garda response time, sufficient Garda resources and ongoing liaison with garda\u00ed on the ground because signage on the side of the road saying &quot;Community Alert Area&quot; is not enough.  <\/p><p>I accept that we all have a collective responsibility in this area.  Perhaps schemes and initiatives could be put in place that have worked well in the UK and other areas, where people come together to support the police in their work.  I do not want to be alarmist but it has been mentioned to me on more than one occasion that if we do not put policies in place that restore Garda visibility and Garda patrols in our towns and villages, it will lead to people taking the law into their own hands, which I do not condone or support.  We will see an upsurge in vigilantism in some parts of the country with people believing they must take the law into their own hands to protect their communities.  I ask the Minister of State to take these points on board and relay them to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300034#HH00400","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Personal Statement by Member","time":1358956200,"counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300035#JJ00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1358956200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I understand Senator Mooney wishes to make a personal statement to the House but before I call the Senator I want to make it clear that I will not allow any debate on the matter.

Fianna F\u00e1il would argue strongly against the devastating blow to the security infrastructure of the State.  The underhanded reduction in the force to an abysmal low of 12,000 Garda members, combined with the jaw-dropping closure of over 100 Garda stations is nothing less than an attack on the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  At the same time, we have an increase in burglaries, drug smuggling and serious dissident activity.  The Government is going way beyond the EU-IMF agreement in slashing Garda numbers to their lowest level in over a decade and in dismantling the security infrastructure of the State by closing Garda stations across the country.  Fianna F\u00e1il has put forward a fully-costed alternative budget proposal that reopens Templemore to allow for Garda recruitment and keeps rural Garda stations open.  Instead, criminals will be toasting the Minister's decision to dismantle the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.<\/p><p>I wish to focus on the set up and the difficulties in rural Ireland, even though this is a motion that embraces communities in both rural and urban Ireland.  In the Mizen Head Peninsula, for example, where I live, Goleen Garda station, which is one of the most remote in Ireland, has been closed.  The Minister has forgotten that three or four years ago an attempt was made to land one of the biggest shipments of drugs near Goleen and it was the local garda\u00ed who apprehended the felons, who are now serving long sentences in Portlaoise Prison.  Ballydehob Garda station on the same peninsula has been disabled and two banks on the peninsula at Ballydehob and Schull have been closed down.  The peninsula is also on record as having the oldest population profile of any rural area, bar one community in Donegal which the Minister of State represents.  It is also regrettable that in the last 12 months we have lost the Cork to Swansea ferry, which is having a very negative impact on people in west Cork who want to travel to and from the UK and on tourism in the area.  Furthermore, Cork Airport has lost approximately one third of its flights in recent times, which is hugely damaging to the community.  <\/p><p>The proposal by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to transfer the responsibilities of Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners to the Cork Port Authority is something which I vehemently opposed in this House.  I succeeded in deferring this when it was proposed by the former Fianna F\u00e1il Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when I spoke for approximately four and a half hours in this House on this matter.  <\/p><p>I have great respect for the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, and my remarks are not directed at him.  He has a great love, respect and, indeed, gr\u00e1 for rural Ireland.  The threatened closure of many rural schools is another difficulty, as is the slow roll-out of broadband in many of the schools in west Cork.  Another enormous problem is the mass emigration from our shores, which has probably never been as intense as it is at present.  If one combines all of these elements, one paints a very dismal picture of the fate of rural Ireland going forward.  I know of several GAA clubs in my own area where problems have arisen because of emigration.  Gabriel Rangers, which is based in the Schull area won the west Cork junior football final two years ago for the first time in its history but a shopkeeper told me recently that 18 of the panel of 33 have now left Ireland, a situation that is replicated in many other areas.  I am not saying that this is all the fault of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I am simply giving the House an overview of where we stand in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>At an Oireachtas committee meeting recently, attended by the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, I focused in particular on the closure of rural Garda stations.  Senator Whelan made a comment to the effect that they are just buildings but if there are no garda\u00ed or buildings in places like Goleen, which is 40 miles away from the nearest large town, it indicates a lack of status for such places and provokes fear among locals that their local garda is gone for good and glory.  When I questioned the Commissioner at that meeting he told me that, in his view, the closure of rural Garda stations was not an economic issue and that little or no savings would be made in that regard.  That must be put on record.  The reduction in Garda numbers is an issue of major concern, particularly when one bears in mind that approximately 2,000 members of the force are engaged in administrative duties.  A total of six or seven Garda stations in my constituency have been closed.  The fact that these were the most rural of stations in the area, which were serving an active community, is a matter of grave concern.  <\/p><p>I mentioned the closure of the banks earlier.  When banks close in areas which have large numbers of elderly people, some of whom do not have cars or access to decent public transport, many of them are inclined to keep money at home.  The professional burglars out there who are staking out rural communities and individual houses are well aware of the fact that people are keeping money at home.  <\/p> <p>An elderly lady was attacked in her home in County Donegal by marauding thieves and in County Tipperary a priest had to disrobe when he had to chase a person who had attempted robbery either before or after mass.  These appalling incidents are a retrograde step.  It is important to send out the message that our rural communities are safe - I am sure the same would apply to the city - even with the diminishing numbers in the Garda force.<\/p><p>In my view the morale of the Garda has never been lower.  The GRA and other representative bodies have expressed concern about the cutbacks in the Garda numbers, overtime and the supply of Garda cars in the community.  It is important to acknowledge the tremendous work the Garda does in difficult circumstances.  I am deeply concerned by the direction of policy being pursued by the Government, in particular the thrust of the Minister's policies.  I concur with the view expressed by Senator Whelan who stated that Deputy Shatter had not the decency and respect to come to this Chamber.  The Members of this Seanad may be viewed in terms of the famous film &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; but Members expect to be shown respect by the Minister.<\/p><p>I intend to support the amendment tabled by the Sinn F\u00e9in Members because I think it is important to lay down a marker that we will not take lying down the cynical cutbacks and closures that will affect the safety and security of people in their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300035#JJ00400","speaker":"1127","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358956800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire.  Is \u00e9 2013, bliain na Gaeilge.  I see in the Gallery Dublin city councillor, Mary Freehill, who works in the community.  I welcome her to the House.  The local councillors have played a significant role in local community initiatives.  I welcome the debate on the Private Members' motion on community development, in particular the opening paragraph which states:<ul><br \/>That Seanad \u00c9ireann:<ul>- notes the importance of initiatives taken in many areas by local authorities, voluntary organisations and business groupings to improve the quality of life in local communities;<\/ul><\/ul>Yesterday we debated local government reform, putting people first.  I did stress in that debate the importance of local community and local council input and the involvement of those involved in local development in community issues.<\/p><p>  In the UK, the Association of Town Centre Management has adopted a purple flag which indicated that town centres and city districts are safe and constitute a pleasant place to be, with good levels of cleanliness and security generally.  Ennis in County Clare was the first town and Dublin city was the second to apply for this flag.  I want to give credit to Councillor Johnny Flynn from Ennis who initiated and subsequently proposed to the municipal policy committee the Purple Flag initiative adopted by Ennis Town Council earlier this year.  Ennis has gone through and completed the pathfinder process.  Hopes are high in this regard.  Dublin city, through the Dublin City Council and Dublin city BIDs programme, is applying through the pathfinder process as well to have the purple flag in the Dublin city area.  I hope we will see many changes coming under the Purple Flag initiative.  <\/p><p>  The Purple Flag initiative started in England in 2009 and is run in partnership with industry, licence holders, retailers, central and local government, police and consumers.  It is based on extensive research, market testing and piloting pathfinder projects.  There are many groups involved in the scheme.  There are two projects in Ireland, the first is based in Ennis and Dublin city is engaging in the process.  The local council joint policing committees would be well placed to take this forward on a national basis, but obviously one must crawl before one walks.  We will see how the first two towns get on and I hope the Minister will inform all of the local councils of this initiative, which is worth following.  It is successful in 25 towns in England and I understand that four or five towns in the North are involved as well.  The award is designed to provide recognition to places which demonstrate excellent standards in managing the area at night.  We have heard Members comment on the safety of areas at night, but this initiative, driven by community and business, seeks to ensure that areas are visitor friendly at night and help to overcome any negative perceptions that may exist.  A Purple Flag week is hosted in England and we may consider adopting it here in order to raise awareness of this initiative.  We must try to replicate the success by promoting and expanding the Purple Flag initiative across the length and breadth of Ireland.<\/p><p>  It is not easy to be awarded a purple flag.  One must meet standards under the following criteria, safety, care, movement of people, transport, car parking and how bars and restaurants are managed in the area.  This initiative is done in conjunction with the business association in England.  In Dublin, the Dublin City Business Improvement District, BID, is the body which is leading on this initiative.  It was Councillor Johnny Flynn and the business association in Ennis that were the first to start the purple flag initiative in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The provision of community services and policing contribute immensely to improving the quality of life.  Many speakers have concentrated on the Garda resources in rural areas.  Community policing and safety has come to the fore with the highlighting of the drastic incidents in County Donegal where elderly people have been robbed in their homes.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, emphasised that cuts to Garda numbers and the closure of rural Garda stations meant that more officers would be on the road instead of behind desks.  What is important is that garda\u00ed will not be sitting in stations but will be engaged in front-line policing.  I share the Minister's view.  We cannot go back to the dark ages, we must move forward.<br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na's Policing Plan 2013 <\/font>outlines the Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station district.  After the closure of 100 Garda stations in 2013, there will still be 564 Garda stations in the State.  This will be significantly more than the comparable number in Northern Ireland, in which there are 86 stations for a population of 1.5 million or Scotland in which there are 340 stations for a population of 5.2 million people.  We must be realistic.  The essential point of the Garda Commissioner's strategy for reorganisation and consolidation is to make best use of our well-trained and well-educated garda\u00ed and, in particular, to maximise their time on operational duties.<\/p><p>  Until recently the Garda station network was essentially the same as the RIC network which operated in 1922, when the bicycle was the mode of transport.  This is not appropriate for the policing needs of 21st century or consistent with modern policing practice.  The Garda <font color=\"#222222\">S\u00edoch\u00e1na now has an &quot;A&quot; class police computer system, a state-of-the-art digital radio system and a transport fleet which is currently receiving significant investment.  An additional investment of &#8364;3 million in the Garda fleet towards the end of 2012 has resulted in more than 170 new vehicles being purchased.  These vehicles are currently entering into service.  A further &#8364;5 million has been made available for the purchase and fit out of new Garda vehicles in 2013 because garda\u00ed need vehicles to get around.  The substantial investment will contribute in a significant way to the ability of the force to operate to the optimum benefit of our communities throughout the country.  A previous Member spoke about Operation Fiacla so I will not dwell in detail on it.  The Garda must be commended for the operation of the effective Operation Fiacla.  As of 31 December 2012, 3,538 persons have been arrested and 1,924 have been charged as part of that operation.  I commend the Garda for that.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  Neighbourhood Watch and the Community Alert schemes are very important.  The people in County Donegal stressed the importance of texting between communities and the local involvement in Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert.  They did not, however, stress the importance of the Garda station in the community, with the garda sitting inside.  Texting and mobile technology the GPS are very effective.  The Minister for Justice and Equality made the point two weeks ago that there is no possibility of losing 1,500 garda\u00ed this year.  There is no question of garda\u00ed not being properly paid.  In the past number of years, the average retirement figure per annum has been 400 so that will leave Garda numbers above 13,000.  Costs are being streamlined in the force but this does not equate with poor or reduced service.  In the context of effecting efficiencies, there is a broad range of initiative being taken and I compliment the Garda on the work it is doing and the efficiencies it is putting in place, which makes valuable use of its resources.<\/font><\/p> <p>The motion \"notes the very limited powers of local authorities under Irish law to compel any actions on private lands, even where gross negligence or nuisance is alleged, and notes that in England, by contrast, legislation gives councils power in particular to enter on private lands and to compel action on private lands;\".  I ask the Minister to consider this point.  Councils in Ireland have their hands tied behind their backs.  I ask the Minister to considering giving power to the local authorities.  I ask him to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to change the legislation.  We should do what England does because it works there.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300036#KK00200","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358957400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>T\u00e1 c\u00e9ad f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire St\u00e1it, an Teachta McGinley.

Such attacks inculcate significant concern in rural communities;<br \/>and that Seanad \u00c9ireann further notes:<br \/>that the closures and cutbacks come on the back of substantial cutbacks, closures and reductions in opening hours in rural garda stations during the course of the<br \/>Fianna F\u00e1il\/Green Party Coalition;<br \/>that both the Irish Farmers&#8217; Association and the Garda Representatives Association, have opposed these on-going station closures on the basis of their impact on community policing, and in particular in rural areas;<br \/>and therefore calls on the Government to support the development of initiatives to improve the quality of life for individuals and families across communities in urban and rural areas, and to reverse the cutbacks Garda stations recently announced.&#8217;&#8217;.<\/ul>Even though the motion is positive in many respects, many of which are worthy of commendation, in my view it is a great act of political ballet in that it dances right around the major issues relating to the resourcing of Garda policing in rural areas in particular.  The Sinn F\u00e9in amendment addresses the issue of closure of Garda stations, the lack of resources and transport.  If the Government is serious about community safety in rural areas, the issue of rural policing must be at the top of the agenda.  The next generation in rural Ireland will not have anything like the public services which were available to their grandparents.  It is a shocking indictment of this Government's attitude towards rural Ireland that this is the case.  <\/p><p>  One of the most obvious manifestations of the curtailing of public services is the running down of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the closure of stations.  A total of 39 Garda stations have been closed permanently over the past year.  We understand that some 100 more are mooted to be closed.  People in rural communities are hugely concerned at the implications of this policy for them and for their communities, not only with regard to safety but also the resulting sense of isolation and insecurity.  There is a very real perception that the curtailment of policing increases the likelihood of people becoming the victims of crime, as evidenced in the number of burglaries and violent assaults on rural households.  I refer to a recent incident in my own home town where an elderly brother and sister were robbed not once but twice in the past six months.  They were terrorised in the process.  This is not an uncommon practice.  It is not solely an issue for rural dwellers.  I refer to a meeting in the Shantalla area of Galway city last Sunday attended by more than 150 local residents to discuss how to handle the spate of burglaries.  I commend the fantastic work of the community policing officer who was in attendance.  It is obvious, however, that the resources in the area are very stretched.  These issues must be dealt with.<\/p><p>  The decision to close Garda stations should not be based solely on the level of crime in an area.  I believe this was the benchmark used by the Minister.  It should be the measure of the success of a rural Garda station and the garda\u00ed if the level of crime is low in a rural area.  It shows the local garda\u00ed are on top of the case, so to speak, that they know the people in the area who might go astray and have headed them off at the pass.  I refer also to the role of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in rural areas in dealing with cases of domestic violence and with accidents and deaths.  It is important to have garda\u00ed based in rural areas so that they can react quickly in times of need.<\/p><p>  More generally, it is believed that the loss of such stations represents a weakening of the social fabric of such communities.  The local garda plays a significant role as a community resource and as a point of contact.  We all know from our own areas that a centralised Garda service means it will take more time for a garda to travel out to a situation, in particular if he or she is not familiar with the rural area and with the houses and people involved.  <\/p><p>  Sinn F\u00e9in is carrying out a significant campaign around areas of rural Ireland.  We have met many people in different areas.  One of the issues raised most frequently is that of rural policing.  We met a group of people from west Cork who are campaigning against the closure of stations in the area.  This issue was mentioned also by Senator O'Donovan.  It is the view of many people in rural areas that the Department review which recommended closures was based on raw crime statistics contained and detailed in the PULSE system.  In their view this is the wrong approach as it focused on crime detection rather than on crime prevention.  Knowledge of his or her community and crime prevention are the main components of the work of a rural-based garda.  The community garda will have built up a credibility and respect in the community.  As things stand, garda\u00ed are often not keeping appointments for community clinics as advertised in stations which are only served a few hours a week.  This concern is evident all over rural Ireland.  Everyday business, such as passport forms to be stamped, is delayed.  I know of a person in a rural area who required stamped documentation for a passport for his child.  He could not find a garda and tried to make an appointment with a garda in a local station.  He was asked to travel 20 miles for an appointment at a specified time.  There was no garda in attendance when he arrived as arranged.  He was asked to travel almost another 20 miles to Galway city.  This is an unacceptable and unfair burden on the community.  A proper service cannot be delivered to people when they need it.<\/p><p>  Garda transport is an issue which has also been raised by other speakers.  In a number of cases, garda\u00ed have either failed to respond or have taken an inordinate length of time to respond to reported incidents because of a lack of resources such as vehicles.  Garda\u00ed should be able to respond appropriately and in good time when called upon for assistance.  Garda\u00ed have told me off the record that they are being asked by their superintendents to use their own cars.  For example, plain-clothes officers have used their own cars even though they are not supposed to do so.  I know this is happening in all parts of the country because I have been told by garda\u00ed.  It is an unacceptable situation.  It is also unacceptable that where a patrol car is not available to travel to an incident - as happened in my home village of Carraroe - the garda should ask the person making the telephone call to collect him.  There has been an overall increase in crimes such as burglaries, an increase of 8% in 2011 and a more dramatic increase of 15% in the first quarter of 2012.  Over 1,700 burglary suspects have been arrested, with more than 980 people charged between April and August 2011.  The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na attributes rising crime to cutbacks.  There will be more than 500 fewer Garda patrol cars by the end of 2012 compared to 2009.  I note the decrease did not begin under the current Government but it began in the time of the previous Government.  However, the current Government has continued the policy.  People in rural communities are seeing an increase in more violent break-ins, often targeting elderly people living alone, such as the recent barbarous attacks in Donegal. <\/p><p>  There needs to be a more focused approach to the policing of rural communities.  The 2007 report, Policing in Ireland - Looking Forward, the Garda inspectorate found that in many instances small rural stations were serviced by one officer answering to a district headquarters but mostly operating alone without ready access to supervisors, an official car or Garda IT systems.  The Garda inspectorate recommended the implementation of a consistent rural policing model to enhance visibility and to make best use of Garda resources for serving local communities.  This has never happened in any meaningful way.  Instead, there have been reductions in service hours or the complete closure of Garda stations.  <\/p><p>  Ba mhaith liom an leas\u00fa at\u00e1 ag Sinn F\u00e9in \u00e1 chur chun cinn.

I will keep my comments as brief as possible.  Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh made the point about the use of the benchmark of crime levels rather than that of crime being prevented.  I wish to take up the mantle for rural Ireland and to describe from personal experience the effect of the closure of Garda stations.  The geographical spread of settlement in rural areas means that older people have become vulnerable to crime.  The economic situation means that some people who are struggling and who are aware that the nearest garda may be 20 km away and will not be available to give chase, have been tempted to commit crime.<\/p> <p>The closure of Garda stations has become a green light for crime.   Although we have the Neighbourhood Watch scheme and members of communities are looking out for one another, there is a point at which one needs a Garda presence to act as a deterrent and ensure follow-up and sufficient reaction times.  Comments were made in the other House about tweeting garda\u00ed or finding them on Facebook but this will not mean very much for an elderly woman who is shaking with fear in her home when there is somebody breaking in downstairs.  Such a woman cannot tweet or find the Garda on Facebook.  If one's local garda is so far away, it raises serious issues.<\/p><p>In my county, three Garda stations, namely those in Bawnboy, Redhills and Stradone, have been closed.  This has been a serious blow to the community and to community policing.<\/p><p>Tomorrow I will be raising in the House the issue of local bank closures.  It is felt that when businesses must bring money further afield to lodge owing to bank closures, they will increasingly become targets for criminals.  This is where a local garda in a small town could make a big difference.<\/p><p>In our amendment, we have highlighted the issue of resources.  In rural settings, it is essential that garda\u00ed have equipment and accommodation that is fit for purpose, including secure digital radio, satellite navigation systems, Internet and e-mail access, and suitable transportation.  The question of transport has been highlighted on numerous occasions.  Garda\u00ed have had to request on occasion that a person who rang them should collect them to bring them to the scene of a suspected crime.  In this day and age, that is completely unacceptable.  In rural settings, as elsewhere, the importance of having Garda equipment and accommodation that is fit for purpose cannot be overstated.<\/p><p>I agree that garda\u00ed deserve commendation on their work on community policing and supporting Neighbourhood Watch schemes.  I note the establishment of the JPCs has been valuable, although I, like many, believe they could have more teeth.<\/p><p>There is a need to maintain the number of garda\u00ed at a level sufficient to provide the most effective and efficient policing service to all communities.  However, the number is simply not being retained at an adequate level.  It is in that context that we are proposing our amendment.  I call on the Government to support it and I welcome Fianna F\u00e1il's support therefor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300037#LL00300","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358958000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I am glad to be able to speak on this motion.

Is it the garda on the beat or in the rural Garda station who solves and prevents burglaries?  It is not.  Up to June of last year, there was an increase, of up to 8%, in burglaries.  In the three months after June, there was a decrease of 24%.  Senator Keane alluded to this.  The trend coincides with an operation called Operation Fiacla, through which there was an enormous number of arrests of known criminals actively involved in burglaries.  This has resulted in a reduction in the number of burglaries in the order of 24%.  Therefore, it is not the garda in the rural Garda station or the garda on the beat who is preventing burglaries; rather, it is Garda intelligence and the targeting of known criminals.<\/p><p>One wonders why Sinn F\u00e9in is speaking in the most inflammatory and terrifying language to the very people about whom it purports to be most concerned.  We need to be responsible in what we are saying and speak calmly.  There is an argument to be made regarding the closure of community facilities other than Garda stations, such as banks and post offices.  Senator Reilly is correct that this may increase the risk of cash in transit being targeted.  The purpose of my contribution, humble as it is, is to talk to the public confidence element and urge us to be responsible in what we are saying.<\/p><p>There is a campaign to retain two local Garda stations in a certain part of the country, which I will not mention.  I was speaking to the very anxious individuals concerned.  Fifteen crimes were reported in one of the stations and 14 in the other, yet the campaigners propose that a garda be present all night.  Rather than having garda\u00ed sitting in a Garda station in an area where there is virtually no crime, it is surely better to deploy them according to a more efficient model.<\/p><p>Sinn F\u00e9in said it has a major campaign under way.  It speaks as if it speaks for the entire population in using its inflammatory and worrying talk.  It is no coincidence that where the party's campaign is strongest, the fear of crime is greatest, although the statistics on the actual number of crimes do not indicate this fear is warranted.

It is in the Dublin area, as opposed to rural areas, that crimes are more likely to be carried out.  To suggest otherwise is being dishonest and it is worrying people when there is no need to terrify them.  Of course, we all have concerns about crime that are legitimate but the statistics show a yearly decrease for the past ten years.

I am conscious that there are a number of Ministers away.  This motion falls between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of the Environment, Community Local Government so we appreciate the Minister of State's presence very much.<\/p><p>My colleagues have focused most on policing, which is the subject of the amendment.<\/p> <p>I am prompted to echo the words of my Labour Party colleagues on the need to ensure the continuation of an efficient and effective policing service to all communities, particularly for elderly people living in remote locations, as was mentioned earlier.  That includes urban areas, where levels of crime are higher.  Senator Gilroy was right to highlight that crime rates have fallen.  <\/p><p> I want to focus on two specific issues that are dealt with in the motion but are not directly connected to policing.  We have tried to reference a range of different initiatives and institutions that contribute to improving the quality of life in different communities.  The first of these is the power of local authorities to intervene where nuisance is alleged to have occurred on private lands.  Second, I shall talk about the purple flag initiative.<\/p><p> With regard to the powers of local authorities, my party inserted a particular clause into the motion which was included at the behest of Dublin City Council.  I welcome Councillor Mary Freehill, who has been to the fore in raising the issue of private nuisance, to the Visitors' Gallery.  The matter has been raised with me and with plenty of colleagues on doorsteps in Dublin.  An example is when a neighbour's hedge or tree encroaches significantly on a particular individual to such an extent that it creates a nuisance.  At present the local authority has no power to intervene to compel any action to be taken on private lands, such as the cutting back of a Leylandii hedge, or take steps to ensure that light is not affected, even where gross negligence is alleged.  By contrast, English legislation gives councils the powers to enter private lands and compel action in extreme cases.  The Labour Party motion calls on the Government to consider the implications of giving similar powers of intervention to local authorities here where poor management or gross negligence is alleged to have arisen on private lands.  Dublin City Council has done a good deal of work on the issue and I have met the relevant sub-committee.  I know the council has already made direct contact with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is an issue that falls between the two Departments.  Strictly speaking, it is a matter of local authority powers and should come under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; however, I understand the view has been taken that it could be more properly dealt with by the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p> The motion simply and reasonably calls on the Government to consider the implications of giving such powers to local authorities.  We need to be careful when drafting in order to ensure that Article 40 of the Constitution, regarding the inviolability of the dwelling, is not in breached in any way.  It will be a difficult task, but the matter is a real issue and causes serious problems for people who feel they have little option or prospect of a remedy.  They have the option of taking a private action in tort but they may not wish to do so against their neighbours.  The motion refers to behaviour that falls well short of the sort of anti-social behaviour that has already been the subject of legislation.  None the less, it is behaviour that can create a real disturbance to people in their everyday lives. <\/p><p> I wish to speak about an issue that is addressed in other paragraphs of the motion.  We have called on the Government to support initiatives such as the purple flag initiative adopted in the UK by the Association of Town Centre Management.  The website <i>purpleflag.org.uk <\/i>sets it out.  The initiative was undertaken some years ago to encourage urban centres - both town centres and districts in cities - to apply for accreditation or recognition where they have significantly improved safety and public amenities between 5 p.m. and 6 a.m.  The organisation is trying to raise the standard and broaden the appeal of town and city centres in order to present them in a positive light and encourage visitors from within the town or city and outside the area.  The initiative has led to significant improvements in areas such as Leicester Square in London, which has secured purple flag status, but also on this island, in Belfast and Derry city centres.  My party sees the purple flag initiative as providing an incentive to local businesses in particular districts to improve their facilities and work with local authorities and local police to ensure there is better safety at night, better litter collection services and so on.  I have had contact with the Dublin City Business Improvement District, which works to improve the city centre area in collaboration with local businesses.  It has already taken a number of initiatives to improve amenities in the city.  The organisation informed me that it has applied for inclusion in the purple flag initiative, as has Ennis.  It is actively engaged with the process and hopes to have a decision soon on its application.  The initiative is an exciting prospect.  Like the blue flag label for our beaches, the purple flag initiative will encourage and attract visitors to particular districts and provide a significant improvement in quality of life for local residents and visitors alike.<\/p><p> I commend the motion to the House.  There are a range of aspects to the motion.  It is not just about policing, although that has been the focus of the debate so far.  My party hopes that the Government will consider our proposals, give powers to local authorities, as I have outlined, and support initiatives such as the purple flag initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300038#MM01500","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358958600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>T\u00e1 \u00e1thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an \u00e1bhar th\u00e1bhachtach seo sa tSeanad tr\u00e1thn\u00f3na.

The motion touches on a wide range of important and interlinking issues which have an influence on the quality of life in our local communities.  At the heart of the motion is an exhortation to co-operative action and a pooling of energy and resources for the common good.  At times like these, when we as a society are struggling to deal with the interrelated difficulties arising from the economic situation, it is especially important to make the most of our combined efforts.  We need to develop appropriate strategies to support effective collaboration between State, business and community interests.<\/p><p>I am thankful that there are already many examples in different parts of the country of organisations such as the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and local authorities working in partnership with a range of local stakeholders to improve the environment for doing business, socialising and the enjoyment of civic amenities.  The Minister supports effective communication between the Garda and business and community interests.  He is aware of the effective engagement between the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Dublin business policing forum, for example, as well as similar liaisons between the Garda, local authorities, chambers of commerce, business associations and various voluntary groups.<\/p><p>Local authorities have been active in support of enterprise and business and some have been creative in identifying opportunities to support the business community.  This is demonstrated by the publication during 2012 of the County and City Managers' Association's analysis of local authority support to enterprise and business and the local government sectoral strategy for economic development, Supporting Economic Recovery and Jobs - Locally.  These have formed and will continue to form an important basis for all authorities to develop local strategies to support the Action Plan for Jobs and to step up their game in their contribution to national recovery.  Furthermore, the action programme for effective local government, Putting People First, outlines a clearer and more enhanced role for local government in economic development.<\/p><p>The principle of collaboration is also a key feature of the role of the joint policing committees established in each local authority area.  The Minister is happy to see that the motion acknowledges their importance.  The programme for government made a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their garda\u00ed.  In the spirit of that commitment, the Minister initiated a review of the operation of the joint policing committees during 2011.  He published a discussion document in November to broaden the consultation process and open the matter for wider consultation.<\/p> <p>He would very much welcome the views of Senators and all other elected representatives on the role and functioning of the JPCs as part of the present review process.  The review process will also need to take into account the broader developments with respect to local government reform which are under way and the implications of this reform for the operation of JPCs.<\/p><p>I have referred to a range of approaches to help improve the environment for business, social and community activities.  It is important that we continue to seek improvements and in this regard the Minister is aware of the Purple Flag initiative which has been established in various parts of Britain and Northern Ireland.  The Minister understands that plans are in train to introduce the initiative in this jurisdiction with Dublin city centre and Ennis taking a leading role, and accreditation also being sought in Newbridge and Dundalk.  The Minister is informed that the Garda authorities are actively engaging with relevant stakeholders involved in this and other similar initiatives around the country.  No doubt Senators will share the Minister's interest in the continuing development of such initiatives to help contribute to crime reduction, the management of the night time economy and community safety generally.<\/p><p>The Minister is conscious that many of the issues which this type of programme is seeking to deal with stem from concerns about public disorder and anti-social behaviour on our streets, particularly at night.  While concerns about crime are fully understandable they should be seen in the context of a fall in most categories of recorded crime, including homicide, public order and assault over the past year.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding incidents of some entirely unacceptable violent behaviour on our streets, it is important that we do not create the impression that Irish urban centres are more affected by public order problems than those in other countries.  Public order problems, particularly at night, can be associated with any major city or town the world over and, unfortunately, Irish towns and cities are no exception.  The garda\u00ed are using the strong powers available to them to deal with public disorder.  In addition, garda\u00ed implement a range of strategies such as the Garda youth diversion projects to encourage some of those who may become involved in anti-social behaviour to channel their energies in a more constructive fashion.<\/p><p>Dealing with anti-social behaviour, however, is not simply about policing.  We know that much of the violence is fuelled by people drinking to excess and taking illegal drugs.  This problem is not simply a matter of law and order.  This is an issue which requires action by parents, educators and those who sell alcohol, not only in public houses, but right across the retail sector.<\/p><p>The Minister and the Garda Commissioner are acutely aware of the concerns about the incidence of burglaries, and also the corrosive effect the fear of crime can have on community morale.  In particular, we are all concerned about the impact on elderly and more vulnerable people.  In response to this situation, Operation Fiacla was set up by the Garda Commissioner and is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country.  Specific burglary related initiatives have also been implemented in each Garda region to target suspect offenders.  In the period from April 2012 to the end of December 2012, Operation Fiacla resulted in 3,538 persons being arrested and 1,924 persons being charged, showing that the Garda Commissioner is effectively deploying the substantial resources available to confront those engaged in this form of criminality.  Furthermore, the latest quarterly figures for burglary suggest that Operation Fiacla is having an impact when compared with the quarterly figures prior to its introduction.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Minister I can assure this House that An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is taking all available measures to respond to this type of crime and especially to the shocking incidents of aggravated burglary which we have seen recently.  While clearly any statistical improvements are no consolation to those who have had to endure dreadful experiences at the hands of burglars, it is only fair to garda\u00ed to mention that the most recent crime figures show that the number of aggravated burglaries had fallen compared with the previous 12 months.<\/p><p>Similarly, the Minister concurs with the sentiment expressed in the motion that community-based initiatives are very much strengthened by the deployment of strong and effective community policing.  Community policing is at the heart of policing in Ireland.  This point has been consistently emphasised by the Garda Commissioner and the Commissioner's Annual Policing Plan for 2013 highlights the importance of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na working with communities to tackle behaviour that affects the public's quality of life.<\/p><p>The Garda national model of community policing aims to build upon and enhance good community policing practice.  It recognises the need for dedicated community police officers, of which there are more than 1,000 countrywide.  It is also worth emphasising, as the national model does, that all garda\u00ed have a role to play in community policing.<\/p><p>This enhanced community policing service is monitored closely by the Commissioner and his senior management team.  The national model plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  In this regard, garda\u00ed continue to work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch.  The Minister is pleased that the motion acknowledges the important work that has been done under these programmes over the years and that it underlines the need to sustain and build on this partnership approach into the future.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality, along with the Health Service Executive, has for many years supported the work of the Community Alert programme, which was set up in 1985 by Muintir na T\u00edre in association with the Garda authorities.  This programme has since developed into a national movement comprising over 1,300 local groups which work with garda\u00ed to promote crime prevention and improve the security of older and vulnerable persons in the community.<\/p><p>Community Alert harnesses, in a modern context, the qualities of neighbourliness and mutual support which have long been characteristic of community life in Ireland.  This can also be said of the Neighbourhood Watch programme which operates with the close support of garda\u00ed throughout the community.  The Minister, in association with the Garda Commissioner, will shortly launch a new Garda publication containing advice for those wishing to set up a Community Alert or Neighbourhood Watch group in their area, and the support their local community garda\u00ed will provide.  These new guidelines take account of societal changes which have occurred since the initial schemes were established and provide a step by step &quot;how to&quot; guide on establishing future schemes.  They also enhance both individual and community participation in crime prevention.  <\/p><p>I would also like to acknowledge at this point the excellent range of crime prevention advice which is available from the Garda, in print or online, or direct from community policing officers and which contains practical advice that all can take to protect themselves from crime.<\/p><p>There are changes to the way policing is being managed and the Minister appreciates that people have concerns about those, concerns which are reflected in today's motion.  The overall objective is to ensure that at all times the best possible policing service is provided to the public and communities across the country.  In this regard the appropriate deployment of Garda resources has been enhanced by new Garda rostering arrangements which were introduced last year.  As a result, garda\u00ed can be on duty at the times of the day when they are most needed.<\/p><p>Some critics have complained that the closure of some Garda stations will save only small amounts of money, but that misses the key point.  This particular issue is about smart policing and the most efficient and effective deployment of Garda resources.  There have been significant advances in modern policing, transport and technology and the work of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the station network must reflect this current situation and not the situation in 1922.  The Commissioner, in his Policing Plan for 2013, has announced the closure of 100 stations.<\/p>                                      Noone, Catherine. <p>Even after these closures, there will still be 564 stations throughout the country which is comparatively more than in Northern Ireland or Scotland, as mentioned by Senator C\u00e1it Keane.  <\/p><p>The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na now has a class-leading police computer system, a state-of-the-art digital radio system and a transport fleet which is receiving significant investment.  An additional investment of \u20ac3 million in the fleet towards the end of 2012 has resulted in more than 170 new vehicles being purchased.  These vehicles are entering into service.  A further \u20ac5 million has been made available for the purchase and fit-out of new Garda vehicles in 2013.  The Minister is very conscious of the importance of transport for the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, as called for in the motion.  On this basis and despite the very serious economic  difficulties, he has sought and secured extra finance to enable the force to acquire a substantial number of new vehicles.  <\/p><p>The Garda Commissioner is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 policing plan will not lead to a diminution in the service provided by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  The Minster will remain in dialogue with his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, on the issue of Garda resources, but it is vital that the still significant resources of the force are used with maximum efficiency and to the greatest effect.  That is why the reforms being introduced by the Garda Commissioner are essential and should be supported by all Members of the House.<\/p><p>The  motion also touches on broader issues in regard to community development.  In this regard, on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, I draw attention to a number of programmes, beginning with the national regeneration programme which targets the country's most disadvantaged communities.  The regeneration programme seeks to rebuild these communities by addressing not just the physical environment in which they live but also by investing in the social and economic life of the areas in question.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government supports an ambitious programme of regeneration projects, including large-scale projects in areas such as Ballymun and Limerick, as well as smaller scale projects at particular locations around the country.  The holistic, multi-agency approach which characterises these projects ensures regeneration is sustainable beyond the initial construction phases and generates long-term advantages.<\/p><p>The ongoing importance of the national regeneration programme cannot be underestimated, not only from a social policy perspective but also in terms of job creation and economic renewal.  The value placed on the programme is explicitly recognised in the programme for Government and despite the current Exchequer constraints, funding for regeneration continues to be prioritised within the overall social housing programme.<\/p><p>A key objective of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the facilitation of integrated development at local level; to foster vibrant, sustainable and inclusive communities, and to support the community and voluntary sector in its contribution to an active, democratic and pluralist society.  In the pursuit of this objective, the Department funds a range of programmes and initiatives to support communities, including the local and community development programme and the rural development programme 2007-13.<\/p><p>Also of particular relevance to the motion is the seniors alert scheme which provides important support for elderly people.  Under this scheme, funding of \u20ac2.35 million has been allocated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2013 for the purchase and installation of socially monitored alarms.  The scheme successfully supports independent living for people over 65 years.  The involvement of local voluntary and community organisations consolidates the ongoing contact by these groups with older people and helps to highlight their home safety needs.  The scheme provides an additional measure of support for many people who may also benefit from the work of Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and community garda\u00ed.<\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government note the issues raised in the motion in relation to powers to enter and compel actions on private lands.  I understand local authorities have some powers to enter lands and private property or compel actions on private lands, for instance, under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2009, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 and the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2011.  <\/p><p>The action programme for effective local government - Putting People First - promotes the allocation of additional powers to local authorities.  Reforms in relation to local authority structures, governance, finance and operational arrangements set out in the action programme will place local government in a stronger position to take on additional functions.  However, such additional functions would have to be compatible with the role of local government generally and be matters local authorities were well positioned to perform effectively.  Clearly, the legal and other implications of this suggestion will need to be considered further, as the motion suggests.<\/p><p>The wide ranging motion we are debating touches on many vital issues that affect the quality of community life.  To summarise, in relation to the policing aspects of the motion, it is the Government's intention to ensure front-line services are maintained at the highest level possible through the most efficient use of resources.  The Garda Commissioner has the Minister's full support in this regard and is confident everyone in the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na will continue to deliver an effective policing service to all communities.<\/p><p>The Government also remains committed to optimising the engagement between public bodies and, in particular, the Garda, local authorities and business and community stakeholders to help to address the range of issues encompassed in the motion.  In relation to community supports, a key principle is to enable communities to identify and address social and economic issues in their areas.  Greater effectiveness and efficiencies in the delivery of local services are priorities, to which enhancing the role of local government in local and community development is central.<\/p><p>On the Minister's behalf, I greatly welcome the initiative of Senators in bringing forward the motion.  I am very pleased to listen to their valued contributions to the debate which I will share with and bring to the attention of the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300039#NN00200","speaker":"1000","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358959800,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

However, I express surprise that my Sinn F\u00e9in colleagues are seeking to delete all words after &quot;between April and December 2012&quot;, which include, &quot;noting the very limited powers of the local authorities&quot; to enter lands where there is nuisance, trespass or pollution.

The first paragraph deals with an initiative from the United Kingdom and the Association of Town Centre Management which is very useful.  I hope it will be adopted.  I understand there is to be a pilot scheme in respect of which I would ask that the House be provided with further information on where it will operate.  It appears it will be analogous to the green flag scheme which was promoted by An Taisce to raise environmental awareness.  There is a clear relationship between the idea and structure of a green flag and purple flag scheme.  It is a very good idea.  I hope it works.  It may encourage local communities to create the reality on the ground that our cities and towns are safe places to walk, after which the flags could be awarded.  The important thing is the creation of those safe areas.<\/p><p>There has been exaggeration in respect of the situation in Dublin.  I walk home almost every night from here via O'Connell Street back to North Great George's Street.  I do not notice very much that is negative.  Significant efforts and strides have been made in policing.  There are those who use drugs.  They are usually unfortunates and one can be forced to engage with them.  Usually, that is just the interruption of a conversation which is irritating, but if one just goes on one's way, one may see something happening but may not be affected by people causing a nuisance.  Nevertheless, the situation must be monitored.  It is probably worse on the Liffey boardwalk.  The boardwalk is a lovely development and it is a pity that it would be spoiled not just for our visitors but for ourselves.<\/p><p>The resolution refers to Garda transport, which is very important, but ordinary transport for people in rural areas must also be considered.  I listened to people from two villages in the midlands whose bus services are being cut to one bus per day.  It will make it extremely difficult to take advantage of employment opportunities in neighbouring towns.  One cannot expect communities to do all this alone if they are deprived of services.  They cannot make bricks without straw.  We must examine carefully the provision of transport links in areas where they are uneconomical.  There has been a great deal of comment on Mr. Danny Healy Rae's suggestion that people should be allowed to get boozed up because they live in the country, which is the wrong approach.  We need, however, to do something about transport.<\/p><p>I will conclude on the issue of Garda station closures.  The Minister referred to smart policing, which is not only a very patronising notion but patently false.  It is like the appalling Danske Bank advertisement which notifies the withdrawal of human service and in a constipated voice-over states &quot;welcome to the new normal&quot;.  We need community policing but it is being eradicated.  We need police stations and to be told the truth.  I have been lied to consistently about Fitzgibbon Street Garda station and told that it was merely being redecorated.  It did not need redecoration and in reality was being closed down.  We have been told that everyone should welcome smart policing and other developments.  I ask the Minister to explain why if everyone should welcome it, consumers, communities and the Garda itself do not welcome such developments.  The soldiers on the ground - the people at the coal face - do not want it.  The Minister should not patronise us by telling us this is smart policing as Danske Bank would.  We do not buy it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300042#QQ00700","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1358960400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I commend my Labour Party colleagues for tabling a reflective and sensible Private Members' motion.  They always come up with useful motions, but this is a particularly good one.  I had no idea what the purple flag was until Senator C\u00e1it Keane explained it was a concept pioneered in the United Kingdom.  Councillor Johnny Flynn in Ennis has been promoting the idea.  Mr. Flynn has a very strong sense of community and has been deeply embedded in his local community in County Clare for many years.  As a former chief fire officer, he understands the importance of community activity.  It is that aspect of the motion I wish to pick up on.<\/p><p>Neighbourhood Watch and community policing are very important.  I do not want to see garda\u00ed in stations, I want to see them circulating and having a presence in communities.  I do not want to see them manning phones in Garda stations because we want to tick a box to show that stations are open.  In reality, most people download whatever forms they need from the Internet and we do not need a necklace of Garda stations in every county such as we had 50 years ago.  Society has moved on.  The vast majority - what I call the silent middle ground who do not bang on every day about things that make common sense - agrees that the location of some Garda stations did not make sense.  I speak from direct experience.  My parish lost a Garda station in the last round of cutbacks.  It did not make sense to have a station located in Lahinch, two miles from the district headquarters in Ennistymon.  It was lunacy to require it to be manned for so many hours a day.  There was a Garda station in Inagh, five miles from Ennistymon, notwithstanding that there was another Garda station in Ennis, also five miles away.  It was a waste of resources.  People want sensible decisions to be made which, though they appear on the surface to be tough, are the right ones.  The Government has a mandate to do that.  I acknowledge that the Government is making tough decisions.  To be fair to our colleagues in Fianna F\u00e1il, I point out that its Members are acknowledging the benefits of the motion.  We are trying to create a collaborative conversation on the practical steps communities can take to make society safer and to make people feel safe.<\/p><p>Many garda\u00ed retired last February.  They are very active people who want to make a contribution.  I suggest to the Minister that we establish a revitalised community alert and neighbourhood watch programme to be led by retired garda\u00ed who have knowledge of their local communities.  They have intelligence and wherewithal gathered over their years in the Garda and would be only too delighted to play their part voluntarily to assist the community.  I know several retired garda\u00ed in County Clare who are deeply embedded in voluntary community work in the areas of housing, GAA and other important endeavours.  If the call was made to these people to roll up their sleeves and assist the community to develop an effective community alert system, it could be done.<\/p> <p>People may not like to hear the words \"smart policing\" but there are hundreds of thousands of smart phones in this country.  There are iPads, there is Facebook and other social media and for all its woes this does bring huge benefits.  I know of several communities in which there is a text message system in operation such that if a strange car is seen a text alert goes out to a group of people.  There are many technological initiatives of which we can take advantage.<\/p><p>I presume I have approximately two more minutes to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300042#QQ00800","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358961000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>The Senator can take as long as he likes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300043#RR00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1358961000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>A great deal can be done.

I am sorry that the Minister of State for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy McGinley has left because he is a fellow Donegal man and would have shared my concern about the recent spate of burglaries in Donegal and their fall-out.  I am from the rural part of the county and now live in an urban part, Letterkenny.  Donegal, like many other counties has rural and urban divides with different policing issues pertaining to each area.  Community policing did not start in Ireland nor did it start recently.  It has been going on for many years and probably came out of America and developed in the UK when the race riots flared up in the early 1980s.  The British police had to look at themselves and ask why there were being targeted by the community they were there to protect.  They had to embrace a community policing policy which this country has adapted and is developing as it goes along.  Statistics show that Ireland is like New Zealand, in having a similar population and rural-urban divide but we have 600 stations whereas in New Zealand there are 400.  We have 13,000 officers as against 8,700 in New Zealand which has embraced community policing.  In the UK, apart from Scotland, there are 1,400 stations.  We have just under half that number although the population of the UK is 15 times ours.  Community policing is very important and it will develop.  It is not a question of having more Garda stations in an area.  My father-in-law, God rest him, was a garda who lived in the station and my wife was born there, as were all of her brothers and sisters.  As she says that was in the old days when most of the stations in Ireland were occupied by a garda and his family.  We have moved on from that.  It may be that in tourist areas a Garda station is open for the month of August, for tourists but not for the remaining 11 months.  The community would have to prove that the numbers stacked up to have it open for 12 months.<\/p><p>We must review the role of community policing in Ireland and embrace it, not run it down.  I am reluctant to point at Sinn F\u00e9in but it has embraced community policing to such an extent in Northern Ireland that it is enthusiastically closing the rural stations there.  In one instance, Bushmills, which is a rural area much like rural Donegal, Cavan or Mayo, when the locals tried to keep the police station open Sinn F\u00e9in refused to support them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300043#RR00700","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1358961000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>David Forde is the Minister for Justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012300043#RR00800","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1358961000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Sinn F\u00e9in is on the policing boards and is campaigning in Fermanagh and Tyrone to close the stations.

They have mobile phones and if they see a suspicious car they can photograph the licence plate and send it to the local garda or keep it.  That facility was not available five years ago.

This debate and motion provided an opportunity for us within the Labour group and our colleagues in Fine Gael to bring forward several issues of concern to us and to get clarity on how the Government is addressing these issues.

Senator Conway echoed my point that the Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch initiatives should be re-energised by a further Government initiative.  These initiatives have been in existence since 1985.  I was involved in setting up Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch groups in my own town and in the rural areas around Carrick-on-Suir.  Like every organisation, the people who get involved initially grow older and people move on.  An initiative from the Government on this particular item would not cost a great amount of money but it would re-emphasise and refocus communities and the attention of the present Government to stay on top of the crime issue.
