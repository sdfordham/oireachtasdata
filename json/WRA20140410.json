Fingal County Council submitted estimates to the Department in respect of proposed works at a number of locations in its area including Portrane.  The estimate submitted by Fingal County Council  in relation to Portrane was for funding of &euro;200,000 to enable the Council to undertake the works recommended in the RPS Report.<\/p><p>The Government decided on 11 February 2014 to make available up to &euro;69.5 million for a programme of repair and remediation works to roads, coastal protection and flood defence and other public infrastructure damaged in the storms from 13th December 2013 to 6th January 2014 based on estimates provided by the local authorities concerned.

For example, Waterways Ireland has responsibility for navigation and, as such, will exercise some limited control over water levels in lakes and river stretches. The Electricity Supply Board, has statutory responsibility for the control of lake levels arising from water requirements for hydroelectric generation of electricity at Ardnacrusha.  Environmental concerns, fisheries matters and tourism\/recreational issues are dealt with by the relevant agencies with responsibilities in these matters.  Local authorities &ndash; ten county councils &ndash; in the catchment monitor water quality with the assistance of a number of laboratories and have responsibility for its control.  The Office of Public Works has no oversight role or authority in relation to the Shannon. Its main area of responsibility is for maintenance on those tributaries where capital works have been carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The Office of Public Works hydrometric service also gathers water level and discharge information at a number of sites on the river.<\/p><p>  Operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is primarily the responsibility of both the ESB and Waterways Ireland.  The ESB has overall statutory responsibility for the management and control of water flows and levels on the Shannon.   Waterways Ireland (WWI) also has a direct role and function in managing levels on the river.   A system of management and control is in place involving co-operation by those two bodies under a detailed set of operational protocols and arrangements for the regulation of water levels on the river.  I am advised that it is the bodies' view that this system has worked and is working satisfactorily.  <\/p><p>  The question of creating a single authority for the River Shannon is a major policy issue because of the very diverse range of powers, activities and responsibilities that would be affected.  These include electricity generation, tourism, infrastructure, water quality, water extraction, waste water disposal, flood risk management and a range of environmental responsibilities. <\/p><p>  The question of the optimum structure or structures to manage the Shannon and its tributaries was the subject of a report in 2002 by a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport .   It is worth noting that that Report indicated that, among the numerous groups and bodies involved in the management of the Shannon, a consensus existed among these groups that, while improvements in the management of the Shannon basin were needed, there was no agreement on the establishment a new organisation as the best means to achieve this end.<\/p><p>  The 2002 report identified the main merits of the present arrangements for the management of the Shannon catchment as:<\/p><p>  -\tfunctional responsibility is clearly fixed in law and each organisation has a precise remit, \tknows exactly what it is required to do and has clearly established priorities; and<\/p><p>  -\tcommunication and collaboration between the various agencies take place using well established mechanisms, such as committees, working groups and partnerships. <\/p><p>  The main weakness identified was a lack of co-ordination, among the organisations involved.  The sub-committee took the view however that it would be undesirable to establish any additional institution unless it could be clearly demonstrated that tangible benefits would flow, which could not otherwise be achieved.  It noted the danger that an extra organisation might usurp or duplicate existing institutions or else be just a talking shop.  The report concluded that the establishment of a new organisation would be something that could be recommended only as a last resort.<\/p><p>  One of the main problems with the Shannon is, of course, that of its frequent flooding.  The management of flood risk on the Shannon is being actively and comprehensively addressed through the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.<\/p><p>  The CFRAM programme is the core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin.  The CFRAM Study is being conducted by Jacobs Engineering on behalf of the OPW and I am advised that good progress is being made on the project.  The output of this important project will be an integrated plan of specific measures to address, in a comprehensive and sustainable way, the significant flood risk factors in the Shannon basin. The consultants will look at all existing arrangements for the management of water levels and the roles and responsibilities of the main bodies involved including the levels of co-ordination between them and will make recommendations on the best way forward for the co-ordination of the management arrangements for the Shannon. In the meantime the main bodies involved will continue to maintain constructive dialogue with all the main stakeholders to ensure to the greatest extent possible that a balanced and fair approach is taken to the management of water levels in the Shannon and its lakes to meet the needs of navigation, power generation and the welfare of those living directly adjacent to the main river channel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000034#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Programme Expenditure","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000034#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[16784\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000034#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the way ongoing delays in major capital projects can be tackled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department sets the capital allocations for Departments and the delegated sanction arrangements under which they make their spending decisions.

When we took that decision, a number of commentators suggested that we had perhaps overvalued the business. However, I can confirm that throughout the process, both BGE and the Government received extensive and detailed valuation advice from financial advisers and our decision was based on this advice.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The strong stance taken by the Government and our clear statement that we were not prepared to sell below acceptable value resulted in revised bids, which were materially better than those previously received. As a result, BGE was in a position to announce on 25th March that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell Bord\u00a0G&aacute;is Energy to a consortium comprising Brookfield, Centrica and iCon Infrastructure for an enterprise value of &euro;1.1 billion.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  This\u00a0\u00a0was\u00a0the\u00a0outcome of\u00a0a competitive auction process, conducted\u00a0in an open and transparent manner in which numerous international strategic and financial sponsor parties were invited to participate.\u00a0In giving my consent\u00a0to\u00a0the transaction, I took account of the fact that the consortium made the highest bid and also of professional advice that this\u00a0represented fair value for the Bord G&aacute;is Energy business. Under EU rules on the sale of State assets, the core principle is that the assets to be sold must be sold to the highest bidder.<\/p><p>  In relation to reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of State assets, &euro;110m of the asset sale proceeds has already been factored into the budgetary figures for 2014. This is being used to meet upfront Exchequer costs associated with the new PPP programme and to fund the 2013 element of the &euro;150m Exchequer stimulus package which I announced last year. \u00a0I have already indicated that additional capital investment has been authorised to deal with the flooding crisis and the determination of the amount of money available for further stimulus investment will be considered in this context. <\/p><p>  \u00a0In addition, a review of the\u00a0public capital programme, led by my Department, has recently commenced. This review will culminate in the setting of\u00a0the Government s capital investment framework for the next five years. It is my intention\u00a0that the\u00a0use of further proceeds arising from the sale of assets over the course of the next few years will be considered as part of the review.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p><p>  The jobs impact of this investment is dependent on how the proceeds are reinvested. A 2009 survey, carried out by the Department of Finance, found that the labour intensity of capital projects generally falls within the range of 8 to 12 jobs for every &euro;1 million invested. While this estimate for labour intensity is used as a general rule of thumb, the exact employment impact varies from project to project as different types of public construction project have different levels of labour intensity. For example, smaller scale projects tend to be more labour intensive than major national infrastructural projects. In order to get the maximum jobs impact from the reinvestment of proceeds the main focus will be on such small scale and labour intensive works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000035#WRB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Assessments","counter":47,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000035#WRB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":48,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[16817\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000035#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide an update on the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":49,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works is currently undertaking the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, in partnership with its technical consultants, local authorities and other key stakeholders.

The primary objective of Government policy on coastal protection is to ensure that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss to economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding,  appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources.<\/p><p>  The Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information is available to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000035#WRB01200","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Assessments","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000035#WRB01250"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[16810\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000035#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if at the Office of Public Works flood risk management conference being held next week, he will relay the points made by public attendees and community stakeholders, to flood insurance companies in any future negotiations between the Government and those companies in order that the full impact flooding has had on communities will be communicated directly to them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>Insurance Ireland, the representative organisation for the insurance industry, will be in attendance at the OPW Flood Risk Management Conference in Dublin Castle on 10th April 2010.

There will be a Question and Answer period after each session of the conference and this time will afford delegates the opportunity to make a point or to ask a question regarding insurance or any other relevant flood-related topic directly to the Insurance Ireland representatives and other speakers.<\/p><p>  The aims of the Conference are to allow the public and interested stakeholders the opportunity to participate in a public policy debate on flood risk management in Ireland; to examine the background to and impacts of the recent severe weather and flooding; to set out the role of OPW and other organisations in the management of flood risk; to outline work undertaken to date and future plans; and to discuss national priorities and public funding in relation to this issue.<\/p><p>  I understand that there are several community and action groups, representing areas that have been affected by flooding, already registered to attend the conference and I look forward to a constructive and productive debate on all flood risk management issues.<\/p><p>  On the 24 March 2014 details of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Office of Public Works and Insurance Ireland on the exchange of information on flood defence works were announced by the Minister of State, at the OPW, Mr Brian Hayes, TD and the Chief Executive of Insurance Ireland, Mt Kevin Thompson.  This Memorandum of Understanding outlines the principles of agreement between the OPW and Insurance Ireland on the information being provided and how it will be used by the insurance industry.  The Office of Public Works will provide Insurance Ireland with data on all completed OPW flood defence schemes which will show the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Insurance Ireland members will then take into account all information provided by the OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas from 1 June 2014.<\/p><p>  I feel that this is an important step forward for people in areas where flood defences have been provided by OPW, as OPW and Insurance Ireland are now working together to ensure that the flood defence works undertaken in recent years are being taken into account by the insurance industry.  There has been a substantial investment of &euro;320 million by the State in all parts of the country on flood relief works since 1995, with over 10,500 properties protected and benefits estimated at more than &euro;1 billion in damage and losses avoided.  It is important that the benefits of that investment are felt by all members of those communities.  <\/p><p>  The OPW has to date provided information on 12 completed flood relief schemes in an agreed format to Insurance Ireland and I now expect to see that, in these protected areas, the insurance industry recognises this significant capital investment on behalf of the taxpayer, and insures properties benefiting from that investment. My Office will continue to work with Insurance Ireland on the ongoing exchange of information on these schemes as they are completed and I am confident that this will lead to a greater availability of insurance to those who currently find it difficult to get.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000035#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sale of State Assets","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000035#WRB01450"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[16774\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000035#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will report on the investment of proceeds from the sale of the national lottery in the development of the new National Children's Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>In February of this year, I granted the next licence to operate the National Lottery to Premier Lotteries Ireland delivering &euro;405 million to the Irish citizen.

The OPW liaises closely as required with other Departments and public bodies that have a role or involvement in coastal matters.   Coastal protection is addressed through a policy which has as a primary objective that in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss to economic assets through coastal erosion or flooding,  appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where such measures are economically justified on cost benefit grounds and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources.  The Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) has surveyed and assessed the coastal erosion risk along the entire national coastline and this information  is available to all Local Authorities to enable them to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties including the identification, prioritisation and, subject to the availability of resources, the implementation of coastal protection works both of a structural and non-structural nature.<\/p><p>  The funding provision referred to by the Deputy was contained in the Government Decision of 11th February 2014 which allocated total funding of up to &euro;69.5m for repair of public infrastructure and facilities damaged by the severe weather events in the period 13th December 2013 to 6th January 2014 based on estimates of costs provided by Local Authorities to the Department of the Environment Community and Local Government (DoECLG). The allocation included up to &euro;19.6m for repairs of existing coastal protection and flood defences to be channelled through the Office of Public Works (OPW). The Government Decision stated that works to strengthen coastal protection and coastal defences, which are separate from the repair and restoration works on which the &euro;19.6m figure was based, would require more detailed examination in the context of the OPW Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management studies which are due for completion by 2015. <\/p><p>  Of the figure of up to &euro;69.5m allocated by Government, a total of up to &euro;2,980,320 was included in respect of infrastructure in County Kerry that was damaged in the period covered by the Decision.

This Government has pursued a determined deficit reduction strategy in order to reduce the General Government Deficit below 3% of GDP by the target date of end-2015.\u00a0 This is a challenging target and one that is set against a difficult economic background which has required fiscal corrections in the form of significant consolidation on the\u00a0expenditure and revenue fronts.\u00a0 The measures introduced by this Government have ensured Ireland's successful exit from the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.\u00a0 To fully appreciate the scale of the expenditure\u00a0consolidation it must be noted that it has been achieved in the context of increasing demands on public services in particular in the areas of Social Protection, Health and Education.<\/p><p>  The 2014 Departmental expenditure allocations were set out in the Revised Estimates Volume 2014 (REV 2014), published on 18 December 2013. It is a matter for each Minister to ensure the prudent management of their respective 2014 expenditure allocations for their Department and all bodies and Offices that fall under the aegis of their Department. With regard to Departmental savings achieved to date, voted expenditure was well within budget for 2013.\u00a0 This effective management and delivery of savings is continuing in 2014 with the latest data on expenditure to end-March 2014 indicating\u00a0that overall net voted expenditure was &euro;261 million or 2.5% under\u00a0profile, a year-on-year decrease of &euro;631 million or 5.8%.\u00a0 In gross terms voted expenditure was &euro;164 million or 1.2% under\u00a0profile and was &euro;452 million or 5.7% lower than the same period last year.

In bringing public expenditure back onto a sustainable path, meaningful reform of the Public Service was essential to ensure that we can maintain and improve services.\u00a0 In November 2011, we\u00a0published our first Public Service Reform Plan.\u00a0 In January this year, I published a report setting out the progress made under the first Reform Plan.\u00a0 At the same time, I also published the Government's second Public Service Reform Plan, setting out our ambition for the next three years.\u00a0 These documents are available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  As well as enabling services to be maintained and improved in the context of reduced resources, a number of reforms have delivered, and will deliver, significant cost savings.<\/p><p>  - The Croke Park Agreement delivered &euro;1.8 billion in pay and non-pay savings.\u00a0 The Haddington Road Agreement sets out a number of measures to deliver a further reduction of &euro;1 billion in the Public Service pay and pensions bill by 2016.\u00a0 It also provides for a total of 15 million additional working hours annually across all sectors of the Public Service, which will help to deliver long term and sustainable increases in productivity.<\/p><p>  - We have undertaken a major review of public procurement and are now implementing a radical overhaul of our approach, with the new Office of Public Procurement targeting &euro;500 million in savings over the next three years (&euro;127 million this year).<\/p><p>  - We are introducing shared services for a range of back-office functions to increase efficiency and integration across organisations.\u00a0 For example, Peoplepoint, the Civil Service HR and Pensions Shared Service Centre, will deliver savings estimated at &euro;12.5 million annually when fully operational.<\/p><p>  - The use of innovative models of service delivery, greater use of technology and more efficient management of the State's property portfolio will also yield increased efficiencies.<\/p><p>  Some of the savings made will be re-invested into public services as a &quot;reform dividend&quot;, utilised to support service improvements and to sustain the reform agenda beyond the current fiscal crisis.<\/p><p>  Of course, as well as reducing costs we are implementing other\u00a0reforms, with the objective of building a\u00a0more sustainable and effective\u00a0Public Service.\u00a0 We have put in place new working arrangements, including longer working hours, new rosters, and standardised arrangements for annual leave and sick leave.\u00a0 The budgetary process has been reformed to make it more transparent and to improve how we spend public money.\u00a0 We are implementing a programme of political reform to increase openness and to rebuild public trust in the State.\u00a0 We are renewing the Civil Service to enable it to meet current and future challenges.<\/p><p>  These are just a few of the\u00a0initiatives underway to build a more customer-centred, open and transparent, responsive, efficient and effective Public Service.\u00a0 Public Service Reform will continue to be an important element of the Government's strategy for economic recovery, with our ambition for reform for the next three years set out in the new Public Service Reform Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000039#WRF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":178,"content":"<p>Question No. 72 answered with Question No. 67.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Data","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000040#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[17201\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000040#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which staff numbers have been reduced throughout the public service in each of the past five years to date;

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.   I have no plans to reinstate the State pension transition.  <\/p><p>  The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension.  It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension (contributory) pension was reduced to 66 years. <\/p><p>  All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. Persons who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  In the case of a job seeker&rsquo;s benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the job seekers entitlement relating to the second benefit year.

There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.   Following an extensive review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas including some increases in Cork.  The fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants on the scheme. <\/p><p>  The latest Daft.ie rental report indicates that the number of advertised rental units in Dublin has declined from 6,700 in 2009 to under 1,500 at the end of 2013. This report also states that rent levels are static in areas outside Dublin, including Cork, Galway and Limerick cities. Analysis shows that properties are available in County Cork within the current maximum rent limits. In the Dublin area in particular, prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. Increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve this difficulty, due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students. I have no plans to revise the existing rent limits at this time.<\/p><p>  Department officials administering rent supplement have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs. The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients and is working closely with Dublin City Council and Threshold to ensure that the necessary arrangements can be put in place in respect of vulnerable families in receipt of rent supplement. <\/p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities. Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to selected local authorities during the year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000041#WRH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":214,"content":"<p>Question No. 86 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Education Allowance Eligibility","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000042#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[17090\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000042#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will ensure that those who were in receipt of a back-to-education allowance can complete the H.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives and the reform measures introduced to date go somewhat toward that goal. <\/p><p>  Currently a person&rsquo;s date of entry into insurance is taken as the date used for averaging purposes.  To qualify for a state pension a person must:<\/p><p>- have entered insurance before the age of 66;<\/p><p>- have at least 520 paid contributions and <\/p><p>- satisfy a yearly average (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid and\/or credited is required for a full rate pension). <\/p><p>  The State pension (contributory) is based on contributions paid and credited over the course of the pensioners working life, and those who had less attachment to the workforce qualify for lower pensions, accordingly, under that scheme.  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more from this scheme in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p><p>  This does not mean that those less attached to the workforce will not have an income need in old-age, and for this reason the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners, based either on the contributions made by their spouse, or on their own needs. <\/p><p>  An increase for a qualified adult, which is means tested, may be made in respect of an adult dependant who does not qualify for a pension in their own right, or who qualifies for a lower rate of pension due to gaps in his\/her insurance.  The means tested non-contributory pension may be available to an individual who meets the qualifying criteria. <\/p><p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994 allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  In relation to women (who are usually the main beneficiary of the Homemakers scheme) and social insurance payments, it is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund 2012 confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors, due to the distributive nature of the Fund.<\/p><p>  The combination of measures under the Social Protection code have resulted in very similar outcomes for male and female pensioners in Ireland, with poverty rates for women over 65 being slightly lower than those for men.  The success of these measures in ensuring equality of outcomes for men and women over 65 is evidenced by the poverty statistics.  The &lsquo;at risk of poverty&rsquo; rate in 2011 was 10.1% for men, compared to 9.4% for women.  The consistent poverty rates were 2.1% for men and 1.8% for women.  <\/p><p>  Budget 2006 saw the personal rate for the State Pension (contributory) set at &euro;193.30.  The current full rate of payment is 19% higher, despite the very significant budgetary adjustments required for most of the period since then.  As regards those with a yearly average of less than 40 contributions, even for those with an average of only 20, such reduced rate State pensioners are paid a higher rate now than the full rate was at that time.  <\/p><p>  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  The system was designed to ensure that people could qualify for contributory pensions immediately rather than waiting for contributions to build up and to suit a system where social insurance coverage was less comprehensive and people could move in and out of coverage as a result of the nature of their employment and\/or earnings.  Social insurance is now long established and is comprehensive in terms of the workforce covered. <\/p><p>  It is planned that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory).  The proposed date for the introduction of this change is 2020, but this may be subject to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000042#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[17094\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000042#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will consider implementing a homecarer's credit for the purposes of calculating pension contributions for persons who spent time out of work to raise a family; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.

The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  For those who do not satisfy these conditions, and have an income need, a means-tested State pension may be available. <\/p><p>  The introduction of homemaker credits would be an alternative approach.  Instead of disregarding years outside the labour market, reducing the duration of the insurance record, and thereby increasing the average number of contributions paid per year, a homemakers credits scheme would involve the award of credits for the period(s) spent outside the labour market in a caring capacity.  A homemaker credit would improve the likelihood of qualifying and of receiving a higher rate of pension for those affected. <\/p><p>  However, the introduction of homemaker credits raises a number of issues, most notably cost.  If they were awarded from a current date, the cost initially would likely be low, at less than &euro;100,000 per annum, based on 2010 estimates.  Costs in relation to current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the 20% increase in female employment rates between 1994 and 2008.  <\/p><p>  A further factor impacting on possible costs would be the date from when such credits were effective.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions indicated that to back-date the current homemaker&rsquo;s disregard scheme to 1953, the year when the unified system of social insurance was introduced, would cost the Exchequer some &euro;160 million per annum.  <\/p><p>  Consideration would also need to be given to the number of possible eligible people previously employed in Ireland, who are now resident in other countries such as the UK and for which no estimates are available but which could add significantly to costs, given the general increase in female employment.<\/p><p>  It is planned that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory).  The proposed date for the introduction of this change is 2020, but this may be subject to change. <\/p><p>  The total contributions approach (whereby the pension payment will be based on the number of contributions paid and credited) will remove the current anomaly whereby people can achieve a higher average contribution rate, and thus a higher level of pension, even where they have a lower total number of contributions paid.  This move will bring transparency and fairness to the eligibility for pension.  Issues such as the introduction of homemaker&rsquo;s credits will be considered in the context of this reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000042#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Rates","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000042#WRJ00750"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[17113\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000042#WRJ00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will consider increasing the living alone allowance in the next budget; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":227,"content":"<p>The appropriate rates of welfare payments in 2015, including the weekly rate of the living alone allowance, will be considered later this year in the context of the Government&rsquo;s discussions on the next Budget.

Specifically, the Act requires RT&Eacute; to provide digital coverage to the same extent as provided over the previous analogue network, i.e. 98% population coverage, and I am advised by RT&Eacute; that this level of coverage is being provided by the SAORVIEW TV network.  For the remaining 2% of the population, RT&Eacute; launched SAORSAT in March 2012.  The development and provision of SAORSAT, which is a &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; satellite system providing access to the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4, was undertaken by RT&Eacute; on its own initiative and, as in the case of the SAORVIEW DTT network, is not a matter in which I have a function.  Ireland is not the only country to have introduced a national TV network on both a terrestrial and satellite platform.  Many countries, including the UK, have developed their digital networks on both the traditional terrestrial platform and also over satellite.  The reason for this is simple. It is technically and financially impossible to provide 100% coverage using a terrestrial TV platform.  However, through SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, Ireland now has 100% &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4 for the first time in the history of the State.

This commitment will be delivered in the form of a new Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill which I intend to publish later this year.  Of particular note, the Bill will provide for the introduction of a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State.  This will provide protection applicants with a final decision on their application in a more &lsquo;straight forward&rsquo; and timely fashion. <\/p><p>As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature. In light of this and other considerations, I have decided that, instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the text of the Bill published by the last Government in 2010, it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced text.  This proposition has been broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee. Such an approach can take account of current Government policy and intervening developments while incorporating the many technical and other amendments anticipated. It also provides an opportunity to address the key policy issues, including those which remain of concern to Members and other stake-holders in the Bill.<\/p><p>Work on the Bill continues, therefore, on that basis, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General while also taking account of any relevant rulings by the Courts and any further submissions received. I can confirm that there are ongoing and very detailed consultations with Advisory Counsel on a number of specific aspects of the Bill which need to be addressed in preparation for its publication later this year. At the same time, the main components of the Bill will continue to reflect those of the 2010 version.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware that I made new Regulations last year governing the investigation and determination of applications for subsidiary protection in the State. The  European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013, which came into effect on 14 November 2013, were made to address certain matters which arose from the judgment of the High Court in January 2013 in the MM case.  Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection now rests with the Refugee Applications Commissioner with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively.  Once the new arrangements have bedded down, my aim is for subsidiary protection applications currently on hand to be processed to finality by the statutory bodies concerned in the shortest possible time-frame consistent with quality and fair assessment of all cases and of course, subject to the cooperation of applicants and no further legal impediments arising.  In those circumstances I would anticipate very significant inroads to be made on the caseload by the end of 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000048#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Visiting Committees Issues","counter":354,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000048#WRP01050"},{"type":"question","counter":355,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[17169\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000048#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which the present visiting committee structure in the prison service is due for reform or is being reformed; the extent to which enhanced rehabilitation and training within the prison service is likely to become available in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>There are fourteen Visiting Committees in existence &ndash; one for each institution. Each  Visiting Committee now comprises no more than six members, and only suitable people with a genuine interest in prison issues are appointed. <\/p><p>As previously stated, the current legislation relating to Visiting Committees dates from 1925 and as part of my plans to streamline the current inspections regime, I intend replacing this old law with a number of new provisions to be included in the proposed Inspections of Places of Detention Bill. These provisions will make Visiting Committees more effective, while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities. A link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons. Under the proposed new arrangements, it is my intention that Visiting Committees will report regularly to the Inspector and will be able to report any urgent or major matter to the Inspector at any time. I believe this will make them more effective and improve the independent oversight of our prisons. Subject to competing legislative priorities, I expect that work on the General Scheme will be completed later this year. <\/p><p>In terms of enhanced rehabilitation and training in prisons, the Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes which include education, vocational training, healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services. All prisoners are eligible to use these programmes which are available in all prisons. On committal, all prisoners are interviewed by the Governor and informed of the services available in the prison. At this point prisoners may be referred to services or they can self refer at a later date. Where a Governor considers, on the information available, that a prisoner needs a particular intervention he\/she will initiate a referral. <\/p><p>The number of accredited vocational courses and opportunities available in Work Training has also been expanded in recent years. Enhanced partnership arrangements with accrediting bodies and the centralising of coordination and quality assurance arrangements have enabled the Prison Service to extend the number of available courses and activities with certification. An Integrated Sentence Management (ISM) system has been introduced which involves a new orientation in the delivery of services and an emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through active engagement with both specialist and non-specialist services in the prisons. The end result is a prisoner centred multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.<\/p><p>The development of prisoner programmes forms a central part of the Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015. There is a clear commitment in the Strategy to enhance sentence planning including ISM and the delivery of prison based rehabilitative programmes such as education, work training and resettlement programmes.  <b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000048#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000048#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[17183\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014041000048#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding naturalisation in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":359,"content":"<p>There is no record of an application for naturalisation from the person mentioned by the Deputy.

The Net National Ceiling for the 2013 SPS scheme-year was &euro;1,255.5 million.  The level of deduction applied, which is equivalent to modulation, was 10% on all amounts in excess &euro;5,000 and 14% on amount paid in excess of &euro;300,000.  In addition, a deduction under Financial Discipline of 2.453658% was applied to ensure compliance with the new EU Budget, as agreed during the negotiations on the MFF and to provide for a Crises Reserve.  The financial discipline deduction was applied, in accordance with the EU Regulations, on payments in excess of &euro;2,000.  Approximately 1% of the Financial Discipline deduction related to the establishment of the Crises Reserve and this will be refunded to farmers if it is not utilised during the 2014 EAGF financial year.<\/p><p>  The modulation deduction no longer applies under the 2014 Single Payment Scheme.  However, in order to ensure compliance with the new 2014 National Ceiling of &euro;1,216.547 million a linear reduction was applied to payment entitlements under the provisions of EU Regulation 1310\/2013.  Under the provisions of this Regulation, Member States has a discretionary power to exclude the activated entitlements held by farmers, who claimed &euro;5,000 or less under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme.  I decided to implement this provision in order to protect smaller-scale producers in Ireland.  The level of the linear reduction applied to those entitlements held by farmers, who claimed more than &euro;5,000 was 10.49%.  It will also be necessary to apply a Financial Discipline deduction under the 2014 Scheme to provide for a Crises Reserve in respect of the 2015 EAGF financial year.  In that regard, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council providing for a Financial Discipline deduction of 1.301951% on all amounts in excess of &euro;2,000 under the 2014 Schemes.  It is open to the Commission to alter this rate following the preparation of the Amending Letter to the 2015 Draft Budget in October 2014 by way of an implementing act.  There was and will be no deductions in respect of the National Reserve or for Young Farmers under the 2013 and 2014 Schemes.

In November 2012 I announced the Government decision that the new hospital would be co-located with St James's Hospital on its campus. Co-location with St James's and, ultimately, tri-location with a maternity hospital on the St James's campus will provide the excellence in clinical care that our children deserve. In making its decision, the Government carefully considered the report of the Dolphin Group, along with detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from members of the Dolphin Group with the relevant technical expertise.<\/p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board  is responsible for this priority capital project, and is focused on delivering the new hospital on schedule, to optimal design and value for money. On 2 August last, I announced the appointment to the Development Board of a Chair and Board members with the necessary construction, architectural, engineering, planning and procurement expertise to deliver this complex and large-scale project. I am confident that the Board, working with the HSE, with my Department and with the Children's Hospital Group Board, will ensure the successful completion of the hospital on the St James's campus and this Government has no alternative plans for any other location.<\/p><p>  The Board is strongly focused on mitigating risks associated with the planning process.

The Steering Group comprised representatives from relevant Departments and agencies, medical professional bodies, the community and voluntary sectors and the alcohol industry.  The Group published its report in 2012 and the two representatives of the alcohol industry, the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland (ABFI) and Mature Enjoyment of Alcohol in Society Ltd (MEAS), published separate minority reports at the same time.<\/p><p>Last year Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy<\/i>, 2012.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products.  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing.  It is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill in the coming months.<\/p><p>As I mentioned earlier, this work is based on the recommendations of the<i>Steering Group Report, <\/i>in which the alcohol industry was represented<i>.<\/i>However, its is for my Department, with the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General and in conjunction with other relevant Departments, to draft legislation to implement the Government decision.  In this regard, the alcohol industry seeks a role for itself in public health policy areas that extends far beyond their role as producers and retailers of alcohol.  They, like all other relevant stakeholders, will have an opportunity to put forward their views during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  <i><\/i>The Government decision also endorsed the other recommendations in the <i>Report of the Steering Group on a Substance Misuse Strategy.  <\/i>My Department has written to the lead Departments and Agencies requesting them to commence work on the implementation of these recommendations.
