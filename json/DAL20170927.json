Waiting lists to access services have jumped by 28% to 2,908 people.  The number of people waiting for longer than one year has increased by 78%.  There are 6,000 children waiting for primary care psychology appointments, 1,784 of whom have been waiting for longer than a year.  These are the HSE's own data on the services in question.  For some reason, the Cork-Kerry region is extraordinarily bad in terms of the numbers waiting longer than a year at 158 out of 324.<\/p>  <p>  The capacity of the Department of Health, the Minister and the system to respond seems very poor.  One in three posts has been filled in mental health services from 2015 to 2016.  In that time, 520 approved positions were allocated, but it was nowhere near what was required.  Some 2,000 extra staff were required, yet only 93 additional staff have been recruited in 2017.  In child and adolescent services alone, people say that close to 600 staff are required before we can get those services to where they need to be.<\/p>  <p>  I have a caseload of children and young teenagers that is quite shocking.  In one case, there was a June 2016 assessment of need, a complaint was made that November and, eventually, a solicitor had to write a letter.  In May 2017, the assessment was carried through.  I have a list, as I am sure every Deputy does, of young children who have been unable to access mental health services.<\/p>  <p>  The Roscommon report, published on 1 September, illustrates more dysfunctionality.<\/p><p>There is also the incredible situation of the loss of a significant number of nursing staff.  The report estimated a shortage of 50 nurses in Roscommon and about 100 in Galway while money was being handed back.  For two years, Deputy James Browne and I have been going to both the Taoiseach's predecessor and the former Minister of State with responsibility, Deputy McEntee.  Who is in charge?  Where is the Government oversight?  Where is the ministerial oversight?  There is an incredible inertia in our mental health services, an incredible lack of joined-up operations and of people working together as they should.  Nobody is in charge.  Ministers seem to be conduits receiving information and passing information on.  No one is drilling down in terms of what is going on on the ground.  Ministers for Health and Ministers of State with responsibility for mental health seem to be in that position to get promoted out of it.  The lack of achievement over the past number of years in this area is truly shocking and unacceptable for the young children and teenagers and their families. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506510300,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Everyone in the House understands the need to improve our mental health services, particularly for young people.  Everyone in this House understands how important mental health is.  One of the positive things that has happened in the past number of years and decade is a much greater willingness by people to talk about mental health, to treat it seriously as an issue and to improve services.  The question the Deputy asks is quite a valid one.  It is not simply a case of resources.  If the Deputy looks at the budget for mental health in 2012, the year after his party left office, he will see it was &euro;711 million.  This year it will be &euro;853 million.  In a period when budgets were very tight, the mental health budget increased by &euro;140 million.  The question we need to ask ourselves is why we are not getting better value for that investment and why we are not seeing significant improvements in services.  The HSE has statutory responsibility for mental health services.  There is a national director of mental health and a director general above the national director.  Political responsibility rests with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who is relatively newly appointed.  He reports to the Minister, Deputy Harris, who reports to me.  It is important to acknowledge there are unacceptable delays in people receiving the appointments they need.  It is also equally important to acknowledge some of the progress that has been made.  As I mentioned, there has been an increase in funding of &euro;140 million a year since the Deputy's party left office.  We now have the national forensic mental health hospital under construction in Portrane, which will allow us to close a very old facility in Dundrum.  There have been improvements to counselling services, including new Jigsaw sites - one in Cork, which the Deputy will be familiar with, two in Dublin and one in Limerick.  We are also seeing the continued development of community health teams and the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Specifically on the issue the Deputy raised on psychology, approval has now been granted for additional staffing resources and this will include 114 additional assistant psychology posts.  There has also been an increase in the intake of undergraduate nursing from 60 last year to 130 this year, which will more than double the number of undergraduate psychiatric nurses being recruited.  It raises the fundamental question that we always run into when it comes to health, which is that more staff, resources and funding do not necessarily result in better services and outcomes.  It is an area on which we will need to really focus in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1506510300,"counter":9,"content":"<p>We have been hearing this for the past four years.  The Taoiseach's reply is somewhat similar to what Deputy Enda Kenny or the former Minister of State with responsibility, Deputy McEntee, would have given us.  If the Taoiseach talked to the parents he would know they will not be satisfied with the idea we all have a better understanding of mental health services.  Neither will they be satisfied with the passing of the buck and the sort of detached commentary that suggests it is somebody else's job to do this.  It is the Government's job to drill down and make sure that things get done.  The extraordinary waiting times that people have to experience must end.  We have made suggestions to the Government on this such as utilising non-governmental organisations far more effectively than it has and to do things differently in respect of the private sector.

He expressed this as a priority - indeed almost as a virtue - in response to my question about the need to provide real investment in order to slash the crippling cost of child care in the State.  Meanwhile, at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, representatives from AIB told my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, that it will not pay any corporation tax for the next 20 years.  A bank that is now profitable will pay no corporation tax - zip, zero, zilch.  As the Taoiseach knows, AIB made a pre-tax profit of &euro;814 million in the first six months of this year.  The tax that is due on these profits is money that is badly needed to deal with the crises in our crumbling public services, not least those relating to health and mental health.  However, we have a golden arrangement with the banks as a result of a legislative change introduced in 2014 under a previous Fine Gael-led Government with the assistance of the Labour Party and yet the Taoiseach talks about a tight fiscal space.<\/p>  <p>  Is it any wonder that we have a tight fiscal space?  After all the austerity, the cuts and the hardship that the Taoiseach's party visited on ordinary people, the banks are back in profit and are told that they are scot-free regarding their corporation tax obligations.  This is happening at a time when families still struggle to keep the wolf from the door to pay their bills.<\/p><p>I find this a very strange way to go about balancing the books.  I can only imagine what the 8,000 people deprived of a place to live will make of this or what the 494 patients who were on trolleys yesterday might make of this.  This cosy tax-free deal for the banks really amounts to another bailout for them.  Much like the Apple tax debacle, it emerges again that the Taoiseach's message to the corporate world is that it can keep the people's money and that he is prepared to tolerate citizens living in doorways and being sick and going without treatment.  The Taoiseach's talk of a republic of opportunity is once again exposed as a sham.  It is in reality a republic of opportunism where his Government dances to the tune of opportunistic bankers.  I ask the Taoiseach to do the sums for us.  I want him to tell us how much tax this State is forgoing from AIB under this sweetheart deal.  I also want him to tell us how much this State will forgo over the next 20 years.

Why is that important?  I spoke to a student audience this morning in Merrion Square about why it is important.  This country currently carries a debt of approximately &euro;200 billion a year.  Contrary to some of the narrative out there, that is not because of bank bailouts.  About &euro;30 billion of that is as a consequence of bailouts.  The vast majority of it is a consequence of deficit spending.  There has been a huge amount of deficit spending by Governments since the foundation of the State.  Because of that deficit spending, it costs us approximately &euro;6 billion a year to service our debt.  If Governments throughout Irish history had balanced the books we would have an extra &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion a year to spend on health, housing, education and everything else.  That is why I intend to ensure that the first budget that I bring through as Taoiseach - the first budget brought through by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe - is one that balances the books, so we do not saddle children of the future with additional debt and we do not require politicians of the future to have to choose between debt service costs and improvements in services.

It begins at 2 p.m. at  Parnell Square.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach announced that a referendum on the eighth amendment will be held in May or June 2018.  After all the campaigning and marching, and after years of being told there was no appetite for it, at last we have got this important and basic first step from the current Government.  However, the question most vital to the thousands marching for this social change is what kind of referendum it will be.  Will it finally deal with the reality of the situation in this country and will it respect the type of recommendations that the Citizens' Assembly put forward?  Or, left in the hands of establishment politicians, will it be another cowardly fudge whereby most pregnant women seeking abortions will continue to be obliged to travel?<\/p>  <p>  Based on comments the Taoiseach reportedly made overnight, we need to warn all those marching that the next three months are critical.  They need to be very vigilant for the type of referendum that we will get.  The Taoiseach said that he is not even sure how he will vote and that he will not direct his party members.  He has had more positions on abortion than he has had different coloured socks.  Unlike the colour of his socks, however, this is not a PR issue.  When he was Minister for Health and 12 people a day were leaving the country, he did not see a need for a referendum at all.  At one point, he thought rape victims should not have the right to abortion and, at another, that women should have the right abortion in cases where there is a threat of long-term damage to their health.  The Taoiseach has said his views are evolving.  While people are allowed to have evolving views, I think we might expect a person who has served as a Minister, who is a doctor, who has been in politics for a long time and who is now Taoiseach to have a more developed view on such a key issue.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently, the Taoiseach and other Ministers speculated that they are not sure the public would vote for the Citizens' Assembly proposals.<\/p><p>Was that not why the Citizens' Assembly was set up in the first place - to test the public mood?  If he cannot make up his mind, would he not be guided by the public forum that he apparently played a big role in setting up?  Are the Taoiseach and his party on the committee going to respect those recommendations or are they going to try to quietly bury them?  I am not as worried as he might be about the population supporting a referendum that would pave the way for abortion rights up to 12 weeks at the request of the pregnant person.  The big hurdle to allowing what is needed is not the public; the big hurdle is here, this D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> The recommendation the Citizens' Assembly put forward will cater for 92% of abortions that take place in the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700007#E02200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506512700,"counter":85,"content":"<p>A question please, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700008#F00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1506512700,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Is it not time we grasped the nettle and faced reality?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700008#F00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1506512700,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The decision made by Government during the week was to indicate that we are now making plans for a referendum on the eighth amendment in May or June of next year.

She was 27 years of age, a sister, a daughter and a friend.  She was the second death from heroin in Athlone in the past two years, the same two years it has been since Garda whistleblower Nick Kehoe went to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to complain about the manner in which the investigation into his protected disclosure about Garda involvement in that very same heroin trade was being handled by the now acting Commissioner, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in.  Two years, two deaths.  If that was not bad enough, it is three and a half years since he made his original complaint yet not a single person has been arrested or charged and not a single person has been questioned under caution.  While the print media were able to report a year ago that the investigation actually upheld the garda's complaint about Garda collusion in the heroin trade, the whistleblower heard nothing.<\/p>  <p>  This decorated garda is out of work sick.  He is about to go on substantially reduced wages.  His absence was first recorded as influenza, then as sick - other and now as mental health even though his medical certificates clearly state that he is absent on work-related stress, which is a violation of his rights.  GSOC has told him it cannot give him the findings of its investigation because the Garda is still investigating.  Meanwhile, he has had to put in a bullying and harassment complaint against his superior officer, a complaint that was handed in by an assistant Commissioner for the attention of John Barrett, which has never been received.<\/p>  <p>  One could not make this stuff up.  This is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now, in 2017, and the consequence of the failure to relinquish political control of policing by not installing a genuinely independent policing authority.  It is the consequence of appointing N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan and leaving her in the position for so long.  That is not personal because the problems in the Garda are systemic and the reform will not come from those who were spawned by the system.<\/p>  <p>  We have the spectacle this morning of a further delay and a holding off of the appointment of the new Commissioner until 2018.  Of course, we want to do the job right this time around but there are enormous concerns around any type of delay.  Perhaps Kathleen O'Toole is positioning herself.  Perhaps she is responding to the resignation of Conor Brady and the very valid points he raised about the lack of genuine political will to undertake serious Garda reform.  Perhaps that is what her move was about.  What is needed now, however, is not just moves but change being delivered.

In the letter she expresses the view that it would be a serious mistake to proceed now to select a new Garda Commissioner until the commission has produced its report on the transformation of the national policing arrangements, and of course we will give full consideration to her views on this matter.  She also says that she is struck by the large backlog of sensible recommendations from the inspectorate and others and the very slow pace of action on them.  The Government shares her concern that the pace of Garda reform and cultural reform within the Garda has not been adequate to date.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will certainly drive that forward with the new acting Commissioner.

The Patten commission cleared out the old guard not just at the top, but also throughout the middle ranks in order that a new broom and a new culture could be developed.  That is and has been the job on hand, and none of the bodies the Taoiseach mentions - GSOC, the Policing Authority and so on - have been fit for purpose.  His own Government has identified as much.  I therefore genuinely appeal to the old Deputy Varadkar, when he was a Minister, to go back and look at these cases.  There are distinguished whistleblowers there now.  I ask him to listen to the points I am making about the deficiencies in the investigations and to come and ask us for more information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700010#H00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1506513600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I do not discount the seriousness of allegations that are made and I assure the Deputy that, if I have anything to do with them, they will be taken seriously.

That is obvious in light of our current crisis.  It is also obvious that the Government has failed to meet its own targets, not only those set in the Coveney plan, but also those in Deputy Kelly's plan, which was introduced during the term of office of the previous Administration.  Refurbishment of vacant residential and commercial units, especially in the case of older buildings, can be key.  Despite its strategy to deal with the significant barriers for local authorities, approved housing bodies and the private sector in their efforts to refurbish vacant properties, however, the Department has sat on its hands as usual.  We are still waiting for the Housing Agency to publish its vacant housing document.<\/p><p>As has been well documented in recent months, for example, in Census 2016, almost 260,000 homes - 15% of the housing stock - throughout the country are vacant.  While that is shamefully wasteful, it might even  be a significant underestimate of the actual figure.  There are thousands of square feet of livable space in what are known as above-the-shop units, which anyone walking around our towns and cities can see.  A vacant building study carried out recently by planners at UCC estimates that if this issue were provided for as it should be, we would increase residential populations in urban centres by more than 260%.  Dublin City Council estimates that 4,000 vacant spaces above commercial units in this city alone have the potential to serve as residential dwellings.<\/p><p>Most vacant spaces that can be converted for residential use are in older buildings, which makes any conversion next to impossible to sign off on because the standards set out in the current building regulations are designed for new builds.  The building control and regulation process must be changed if we are to make a dent in the levels of building vacancy and dereliction.<\/p><p>The Bill seeks to establish an expedited process for building control and planning administration in each local authority.  This could increase the supply of dwellings in existing buildings where there are changes in use and-or limited building works in certain classes of development.  It could also ensure compliance with safety standards in existing multi-occupancy residential buildings and regulate unauthorised developments.<\/p><p>We are seeking to reduce the costs associated with converting such buildings and accelerate the process in terms of planning permission, building certification and fire safety certification while keeping it in line with best international practice.  We have spoken to and worked with builders, architects and all relevant stakeholders in order to draw on their experience and make a realistic effort to improve the current process, which does not allow the units in question to enter into use.

As a doctor, how can the Taoiseach stand over a report that is essentially determined by a report from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which does not comprise doctors or experts in the field of medicinal cannabis, which is 77% funded through fees from the pharmaceutical industry and which led the committee to make a statement to the effect that, \"there is still a shortage of peer-reviewed evidence for the efficacy and safety of cannabinoid treatment for many conditions\" while, at the same time, refusing even to take testimony from, for example, Professor Mike Barnes, honorary professor of neurological rehabilitation at Newcastle University, who wrote the authoritative report on medicinal cannabis for the British Parliament and said the exact opposite to what our committee said?  According to Professor Barnes, while it is certainly true that more peer-reviewed work is always needed, it is untrue to imply that current evidence is inadequate, particularly given that there is considerable evidence of efficacy in the context of chronic pain and spasticity - both indications having licences in different jurisdictions - as well as nausea, vomiting, anxiety and childhood epilepsy.<\/p><p>That is just one example - I could quote more but I do not have time - of where the actual medical experts have given evidence, although ignored by the health committee, directly counter to the recommendations essentially inspired by the HPRA.

It is the situation of hospices in Ireland, in our area of Dublin West, which serves Dublin 15, Dublin 7, much of County Meath and the rest of Dublin, and also the sister service in Raheny under the auspices of St. Joseph's hospice service.  When the country was in financial collapse, the staff of the hospices, which are designated section 39 organisations, voluntarily took the parallel FEMPI pay cuts.  Staff in hospices are qualified nurses, doctors and physicians and therapists of various kinds and are paid on HSE scales.  The Taoiseach's Government is batting this back and forward.  The amounts of money are relatively small.  The Taoiseach's Government is refusing to fund the hospices to provide for the reinstatement of the FEMPI cuts that the doctors, nurses and home care teams, who we all praise, took.  I do not think there is anybody in this Chamber who does not have personal experience of a hospice.  Why has the Taoiseach and his Government failed to respond?  He is passing the buck from himself to the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who has a level of responsibility, and now onto the HSE with the Minister for Health not really being accountable on this.  The hospice in Milford is affected by this.  The general system of people dying, often in noisy wards in public hospitals, is completely replaced by the hospice movement providing for people in the terminal stages of illness with dignity and grace and with their families around them.  I do not understand the Taoiseach's attitude.  He is personally aware of the work of the hospices.  I do not understand where his Government is coming from.<\/p>  <p>  Given his former role as Minister for Health, I do not understand why the Taoiseach has cut &euro;50,000 from the healthy babies initiative in Ireland which was used to promote breastfeeding.

Did I hear correctly we were given a date for the last meeting but no date for the next?  The number of people on hospital waiting lists in August increased for the month by 3,500 so we now have almost half a million people awaiting outpatient treatment.  The Minister for Health tried to bury this bad news by releasing it late on a Friday evening.  Trolley numbers are also up.  August saw 7,781 admitted patients on trolleys.  That is an increase of 27% on 2016.  I do not know about anybody else but that fills me with fear and trepidation as we head through the autumn and into the winter time.  The reality is the level of overcrowding now in our emergency departments remains at a record high.  In the first eight months of 2017, 65,455 people admitted for care were on trolleys.  That is up 7%.  It is absolutely shocking.  I have no sense of any plan emerging to deal with it.  Yesterday there were 494 people on trolleys.  In Cork, there were 50 patients in the ED and 51 in Limerick.  It is very clear these people are being failed.  What will the Taoiseach's commitment be in respect of the budget?  I have heard him time and again offsetting his responsibilities to the HSE.  We are all aware of the statutory function of the HSE but the Taoiseach is in charge.  What plans does he have in the budget to recognise these crises?<\/p><p>Three weeks ago, my colleague, an Teachta Louise O'Reilly, published a proposal to establish Comhliosta, an integrated hospital waiting list management system, to try to tackle the waiting lists more efficiently and reduce waiting times.

Does the Taoiseach accept the policy of diverting money from the National Treatment Purchase Fund was wrong and that waiting times just went too long and that people are waiting far too long?<\/p>  <p>  In terms of health policy in general, there is a bit of confusion.  I will hear the Taoiseach's reply on it.  The Taoiseach has clearly abandoned the compulsory insurance policy and White Paper, which we were promised in 2011.  We were promised it up to about 2015 to 2016.  Now we have the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Other Deputies have mentioned the 645,000 people on waiting lists, emergency department overcrowding, huge problems across the board, 459 people on trolleys yesterday, the hospice situation and the situation of section 39 staff.  We raised it with the Taoiseach and he has been very dismissive of it.  They are in a really tough situation now.  They took a cut at the time and they have not got the allocation from the pay award.  They are meant to compete with the other hospitals and everybody else for staff on lower wages.  It is not sustainable and it is wrong to put our hospices in that situation.  I thought there would be big plans on health following the Taoiseach's election but I have not seen any.  Is the Sl&aacute;intecare report Government policy now or not?  The Taoiseach used the phrase \"the Government's response to Sl&aacute;intecare\" as if to say the Oireachtas had produced Sl&aacute;intecare.  What is Government policy or Fine Gael health policy because I cannot find it anywhere?

A network of communications professionals from across Government will be developed to share best practice and develop continuing professional development for the communication function.<\/p>  <p>  The unit has commenced work but further organisational change will be required before it is fully operational.<\/p>  <p>  The current staff of the unit is made up of six serving public and civil servants, assigned on secondment or through reallocation of internal resources within the Department of the Taoiseach.  It is headed by a director, on secondment from a State agency, at assistant secretary level.  The other five staff have been reassigned from within the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Further staff will be recruited, including through the assignment of three media and communications assistants, who were already in the process of recruitment, to fill existing vacancies through an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service.  Staffing decisions on the unit will be made by the Department&rsquo;s senior management.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort will be made to avoid duplication with existing functions, both within the Department and across the public service.  Indeed, one of the principal purposes of this initiative is to reduce duplication and increase whole-of-Government co-ordination.<\/p>  <p>  As well as increasing the effectiveness and quality of communications, this will also lead to greater value for money and reduced expenditure overall.<\/p>  <p>  As an initial step in the modernisation of communications, my Department conducted some research on existing communications activities, including the range of campaigns, brands and channels of communication used by different agencies, which have built up over many years under successive governments.  The results of that research will be used by Civil Service management to help frame the work plan for the new unit.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, most of the existing communication activities are an essential part of the work of State agencies, in areas such as transport, tourism, trade and investment promotion, food, energy and public health.  Nevertheless, there are significant opportunities for building the effectiveness of that existing capacity, as well as for rationalisation.<\/p>  <p>  This will ensure that the new approach to strategic communications will be cost-neutral.  In fact, it is likely to give rise to a significant increase in value for money and a reduction in overall expenditure over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700019#R01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1506518100,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Given that there would be no change of policy or direction from this Government on the Taoiseach's watch, it was probably inevitable that he would dedicate his efforts instead to a change of tack in terms of spin, presentation, the look of the thing and how it sounds to the public.<\/p>  <p>  From the Taoiseach's response I have no sense as to the relationship between this strategic communications unit and him, as Taoiseach.

Originally, it was supposed to be completely separate from the Government Information Service.  He said that in the House but now he is claiming it will integrate fully with the Government Information Service.  Originally, he admitted that it was his personal initiative.  Now he claims that it is a standard Civil Service unit.  He said in August it would employ two people and be cost neutral.  Last week, in response to a parliamentary question, he outlined how it will have six staff and will save money into the future.  Which is it?  Could the Taoiseach clarify for us whether it is he who personally decided that the head and deputy head of the unit should take up their roles, and that neither of them is a permanent member of the staff of the Department of the Taoiseach?  Did the civil servants come up with this proposal?  Why were the positions not advertised?  That is best international practice, which the Taoiseach has told us is behind all of this in the first place.  Could he clarify why they are represented at meetings of political advisers if they are not political?  If they are appointed to their role by the Taoiseach and not by the Secretary General then they are political staff.  The Taoiseach can dress it up any way he wants but that is the simple fact.  That he keeps denying it just confirms in my view that he has been caught installing the largest political spin operation in the history of Irish Government.  Could he explain, as Deputy Burton asked, the &euro;150,000 that is to be spent on researching public attitudes to Government?  Which subheads have been reduced in order to fund the staff of the unit and measures such as the market research, which is political by definition?

We discussed the political situation in Northern Ireland and both the Prime Minister and I agreed on the need to have the power-sharing institutions restored as soon as possible.  We repeated our strong message to the Northern Ireland parties to redouble their efforts to reach an agreement to re-establish the Executive.  We reaffirmed our two Governments' commitment to protecting the peace process and the progress made in Northern Ireland in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  During the meeting we also\u00a0discussed the ongoing Brexit negotiations and the Prime Minister's speech in Florence last Friday.  I indicated that my Government wanted to make sure that the close relationship built up between the two countries in recent years is maintained into the future, although Brexit is clearly an enormous challenge to that.<\/p>  <p>  While the Florence speech contained some welcome elements we need to see more detail and, in particular, we need to see greater clarity on how we are going to avoid a border between North and South.  In this context, I welcomed the Prime Minister's clear statement that physical infrastructure would be unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  Our meeting in Downing Street followed my meeting with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, in Dublin on 31 August, when we also spoke about the serious issues arising from Brexit.  During that meeting I underlined to the Chancellor the importance of making sufficient progress on the phase 1 issues currently under discussion.  They are citizens' rights, financial matters, and of course, the unique Irish issues.  I also made clear the Government's objective that there should be no new impediments to the all-island economy that has been able to develop over the past two decades and which is a gain of the peace process that benefits communities across the island.<\/p><p>The Prime Minister's speech in Florence contained some welcome elements.

For it to happen, the issues of contention which had been agreed upon previously have to be addressed.  We have set these issues out for the Taoiseach and his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, in the clearest possible terms.  I respectfully suggest that, rather than endlessly restating his desire for this to happen, the Taoiseach might set out for us what precisely he is doing to ensure that commitments are met around Acht na Gaeilge, a bill of rights, and funding for legacy inquests.  As the Taoiseach knows, there are families that have waited decades simply for an inquest into the death, shooting or killing of a loved one.  Not all of these families are republican or nationalist, lest there be any misunderstanding.  Those issues need to be resolved.  It is as clear as the nose on anybody's face that this is the case.  When they are resolved, we will move forward with the institutions.  The Taoiseach and others here like to play the game of saying Sinn F&eacute;in does not want the institutions.  We want them.  I would go so far as to say that the institutions are a necessary part of our journey as Irish republicans, committed to an equal society and a united Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of Theresa May and Brexit, the Prime Minister's speech in Florence clarified precisely nothing.  What we have from Theresa May and the British system is lots of words and noise but no meaning.  We need to move to a position where the British set out not some meaningless formula around \"no return to borders of the past\", but concrete propositions as to how we will protect the interests of Ireland, North and South.  We must make absolutely sure that there is no border.  It is not a case of highlighting the technology that might manage or ameliorate a border.

The Creative Ireland programme is a high-level, high-ambition five-year initiative from 2017 to 2022 building up to the centenary of the foundation of the State, which aims to place creativity at the centre of public policy.  The programme is being led by my Department in partnership with other Departments and agencies, local authorities, the third level sector, arts and culture organisations, including the national cultural institutions, media organisations and relevant non-governmental organisations.  The launch document for the programme identified ten actions for 2017 under the five specific pillars, namely, enabling the creative potential of every child, enabling creativity in every community, investing in our creative and cultural infrastructure, Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production and unifying our global reputation.  I am glad to report that there has been significant progress regarding the delivery of the ten actions identified for 2017.  Briefly, the position is as follows.<\/p>  <p>  Under pillar 1, my Department is drawing up a five-year creative children plan for the period 2018-22 in conjunction with the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council, and this will be launched later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding pillar 2, a culture team has been established in each of the 31 local authorities, and each local authority has produced a 2017 Creative Ireland plan and is in the process of drawing up a more detailed 2018 creative plan setting out a five-year plan for local creativity.  The first Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca, Ireland's new national culture day, was launched on Easter Monday with the theme \"Inclusion and Diversity\", and consideration is now being given to the approach to the cruinni&uacute; in 2018.  Following consultation with my Department, a pilot scheme to assist self-employed artists who have applied for jobseeker's allowance has been put in place by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding pillar 3, work is progressing on the preparation of plans for the development of each national cultural institution to 2022, as well as a five-year capital investment programme for the culture and heritage sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700024#W00700","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1506521100,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Department held a roadshow that possibly hit every county in the country, and I had the pleasure of attending it in Cavan and Monaghan.  To me, it was very much a marketing and public relations exercise and many of the related statements were quite vague.  I want to see the exact actions we are talking about.  I know the Minister has touched on some of them.  Perhaps we could talk a little about the arts in education pillar.  One of the Minister's commitments is that every child in Ireland will be able to access music, drama and the visual arts.  Most of our local authorities in this day and age are already doing that.  Our ETBs are already doing so.  It is nice to see that being brought together in a coherent way but much of that work was already being done.  We have the arts in education charter, which was launched in 2013.  There was a commitment in it to the local arts in education partnerships.

Six centres in 2013 rolled out that arts in education training.  It has now gone right across to all 21 education training centres.  I was in Scoil &Eacute;anna in Ballybay only a couple of weeks ago and two teachers there had availed of the training and they are very much looking forward now to the next stage of it, which is the implementation of the creative children plan.  That will be launched very shortly.  We are working with the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs in developing this further.  This is the first time three Departments, the Arts Council and the national cultural institutions have all come together to develop and implement the plan.  It is very important.  Many things happened as part of Culture Night, which is getting very popular right across the country.  There were loads of events in every single county this year.  We are continuing to expand what we have but it is also very important that we all work together.  It is a matter of engaging more children and more communities in the arts, and that is what this plan, Creative Ireland, is about.

It is important to have a coherent approach to library services, museums and visual arts officers.  However, is there a duplication between cultural teams and cultural officers of what arts officers were already doing in their county development plans and in their own jobs?

I went back out to meet the different stakeholders in the local authorities and what they said to me was that they - the arts officers, the museum curators, the heritage officers and the different sections within the authorities - had worked together for the first time.  This is a legacy programme from 2016.  We have the creative co-ordinators working within the local authorities, working with communities and working with all of the different officers.  They are all working together and the creative co-ordinator may at times be the arts officer, the museum curator or the heritage officer.<\/p>  <p>  I met them all yesterday.

It is a key part of the diversity of this planet.  Language is a structure of thought and if we lose those structures of thought, the world is a poorer place as a result.  Irish can be part of our future.  Thousands of families are struggling to raise their families through Irish but they are meeting a State that enforces compulsory English on them.

The Minister of State mentioned there are many wonderful things happening in respect of the Irish language throughout the country and I agree with him.  However, the critical indicator of success is the number of people who stated on their census forms that they speak the language in the Gaeltacht and outside of the Gaeltacht.  According to the figures, that number is crumbling.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to an Irish language education expert.  She told me that there are 800 children in the primary education sector who come from Irish-speaking families in the whole of the Gaeltacht.  That shows the thread on which language as a community language exists.  Unless we have the Irish language spoken as a community language, it loses all its richness and it is not a daily experience.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned Gaelscoileanna.  Some 25% of the parents of this country want Gaelscoil education for their children yet just 5% currently receive it.  Within the Department of Education and Skills there is no mechanism for an English language school to flip to become an Irish language school.  If it is a Catholic school, the Department would help it become a secular school, which is fine, but there is no mechanism within the Department to allow an English language school to become a Gaelscoil, despite the fact 20% of parents are being refused the type of education they would select for their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700025#X01600","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1506522300,"counter":415,"content":"<p>There is a number of schemes, as the Minister of State has outlined, for promoting the Irish language.

To advance the implementation of this ambition programme, I have  established a dedicated project office within my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700027#Z00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1506522900,"counter":433,"content":"<p>The Minister has spoken about the importance of Creative Ireland.

As an interim measure, and pending a permanent solution being found for the future development of the national monument, a limited scheme of essential protective and stabilisation works was completed last July.  These works were specifically approved by the High Court and have been carried out to the highest possible standard by an expert contractor under the supervision of one of Ireland&rsquo;s pre-eminent conservation architects.  They have been monitored all along by the Department&rsquo;s archaeological and architectural personnel, including the acting chief archaeologist.<\/p>  <p>  The essential works completed were confined to preserving and protecting the buildings for the time being.  They were limited to re-roofing, essential structural stabilisation, urgent works to the external fabric and necessary measures to secure the boundaries of the State-owned buildings.  Progress on the works was charted in a fortnightly published report with photographs.  Several representatives from the Moore Street consultative group visited the site while the works were under way.  The works were endorsed by a highly experienced independent architect appointed by the Moore Street consultative group.  The OPW is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and management of all national monuments in State care, with some 1,000 monuments at approximately 750 locations around the country. <\/p>  <p>  The OPW assumed responsibility for the maintenance and security of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street buildings when the site was vacated by the contractor in July.  On foot of the recommendations of the Moore Street consultative group, a follow-up Moore Street advisory group has been set up and is independently chaired by Dr. Tom Collins.  This group has met on several occasions.  I understand the Deputy attended at its most recent meeting on 19 September at which a full and detailed briefing on the condition of the buildings, as well as the proposed approach to their ongoing maintenance, was given by the senior conservation architect from the OPW.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700028#AA00350","speaker":"1249"},{"type":"speech","time":1506523500,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I noted from the OPW&rsquo;s presentation that there could be a need for it to act or react promptly, that it should not need to have to go through a whole bureaucratic procedure and that it should have the finance to do that.<\/p>  <p>  We know the court case is coming up at the end of the year.

I know hindsight is great, but we could have done more back in the day when the Government was buying Nos. 14 to 17.

I examined the report but I could not find the details I had sought.<\/p>  <p>  I am also slightly concerned about the structure of the tax breaks in the sector.  What we must do with those tax breaks is ensure we are left with a growing, deeper infrastructure that produces for the future.  I am worried that some of the schemes are just mechanisms whereby foreign firms can partner with local firms without leaving an infrastructure or a human resource behind to develop the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700029#BB00800","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1506524100,"counter":468,"content":"<p>The budget this year for Creative Ireland was &euro;5 million.

The primary school on Sherkin Island closed last June.  Children now attend school on the mainland, which means using the ferry to get there.  There is no supervisor on the ferry or on the mainland once the ferry docks.  The children must then walk to the school bus, which is some distance away.  This poses a significant health and safety risk to the children, some of whom are as young as four years of age while others are 12.  I call on the Minister to address this as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  I will set the scene.  Sherkin Island is one of the most southerly points in Ireland, an island approximately one mile off the west Cork coast.  Three miles long and one wide, it has a beauty and a variety of landscapes.  It epitomises all that is good about island living.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister is aware, Sherkin Island national school closed its doors for the last time at the end of the most recent school year.  This saw the end of 124 years of primary education on the island.  From the time that the island community was notified that the school was closing, it did its utmost to work with parents, the patron and the Government to ensure that the children on the island had continued access to education.  Those children are now attending school on the mainland and, obviously, must use the ferry to get there.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has provided an extra ferry to ensure that the children can get off the island in the morning.  The residents are grateful for this.  However, there is an urgent need for a chaperone on the ferry and to escort the children from the pier to the bus in Baltimore on the mainland.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills stopped the grant aid for the school and left the island people with no provision to access education.  The island community, working with the patron and the school, requested meetings with the Department and submitted a proposal to ensure continued access to education.<\/p><p>The Department of Education and Skills advises that ferry services operating from offshore islands do not come under the education transport scheme and while the island community has successfully negotiated a deal whereby the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would subsidise an additional ferry for morning travel, it does not go far enough.  At present, parents of children between the ages of four and 12 are operating a rota system to chaperone their children on the ferry and thereafter from the ferry to the bus on the mainland.  This is a four-hour daily commute for parents wishing to educate their children by the only means open to them.  It is unfair.  They are working parents who cannot afford to take time off.  In essence, this system is not sustainable in the long term.  The Department of Education and Skills has a responsibility for the safety of these children.  There is a social and community benefit to the State supporting these children to attend school on the mainland and still live on the island.  I therefore call on the Minister to recognise this oversight and provide a chaperone in order that these children may access education as is their right, in line with their peers on the mainland.  If we want to keep our island communities vibrant and sustainable, we need to allow young families to keep living on the island.  It is time for a bit of common sense and long-term thinking when it comes to supporting our islands.  Will the Minister please provide a chaperone for these children for the ferry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700031#DD00800","speaker":"1262","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506525900,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony for raising this issue.  I am happy to reply on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  The Department and Government are very aware of the importance of small schools in rural communities.  That is why it is in the programme for Government that small schools will not be closed without the consent of parents.  The initiative for closing a school may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, boards of management, the patron or the Department.  Any proposal to close a school must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders and follow decisions taken at local level.  I understand that procedure was followed in this case.<\/p>  <p>  The position with regard to school transport is that it is a huge operation.  There are 116,000 children, including almost 12,000 children with special educational needs, who are transported every day in approximately 4,500 vehicles.  Such a large programme requires that eligibility criteria are applied nationally on a uniform basis.  The scheme only provides support for escorts to accompany children with special educational needs.  Escorts are not a feature of the mainstream primary or post-primary school transport services.  Many children use ordinary scheduled services which provide that access.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the planning and time-tabling of school transport routes.  It endeavours, within available resources, to ensure that each eligible child has a reasonable level of school transport service in the context of the scheme nationally.  Routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 2.4 km to travel to a pick-up point.  Children living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Sherkin Island there is no charge for the children on the ferry.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that there are two children who are in fourth and sixth class who attend Rathmore national school with an address on Sherkin Island.  As these children are collected at the pier where they get off the ferry, a long walk is not involved.  Unfortunately the scheme that applies has to apply uniformly and we do not provide chaperones in the sort of circumstances the Deputy describes.  They are confined to children with special needs.  There are other children who have to adapt to the scheme.  There are continual demands for expansion and extension of this scheme.  We have had to operate in a situation where rules are applied uniformly in order that we can stand over them on a consistent basis and where every child is treated on the same basis.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700032#EE00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1506525900,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I welcome the allocation of &euro;411,000 for Limerick City and County Council for the local improvement scheme.  It demonstrates the Minister's and Government's commitment to the continuing development and improvement of rural Ireland.  It was one of the major issues during the crash.  Under the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government, discretionary spending on rural and tertiary roads was all wiped.  We did not have the money.  Now that the economy is in a state of recovery and we are looking to spread that recovery, it should be recognised.  I want to put on the record of the House that I recognise the Minister's commitment to it.  Given his background, he will excel in the job and he is extremely committed to it.  The &euro;411,000 for the local improvement scheme is welcome.  It is a rural scheme for the improvement of private roads on which there are two or more landowners.  They can avail of the scheme to surface-dress the road as opposed to fully reconstructing it.  The landowners try to maintain it as best they can but the roads can deteriorate over time and it is a period of time before they are resurfaced.  There are a number in Limerick City and County Council at the moment.  There are 54 on the list.  Given the current costs, this &euro;411,000, will do a further 12 roads, up to 20% extra, which is extremely welcome.<\/p><p> They have escalated the issue to me and suggested that the deadline for the uptake of the money might be extended because it can be challenging to surface-dress these roads in the winter months.  They are not being reconstructed and are predominantly being surface-dressed.  They request extending the deadline for drawing down the money to allow that surface-dressing to take place in spring or summer as that is when I have been told the discretionary spending on the local improvement scheme takes place in Limerick.  We cannot guarantee the weather, which may be good in November.  However, they seek an extension of time to allow the surface-dressing take place in 2018.<\/p> <p> As a Deputy for County Limerick, I welcome the allocation of &euro;411,000 for Limerick.

He is quite correct in saying that the local improvement scheme, LIS, is a very important scheme for rural areas.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach and I announced the provision of &euro;10 million for a local improvement scheme for 2017 at the National Ploughing Championships last week.  The scheme supports improvement works on private and non-public roads.  Often these roads lead to multiple residences, parcels of land that support agricultural activity, or public amenities such as lakes, rivers or beaches.<\/p>  <p>  My Department wrote to local authorities in August to establish the level of demand for a local improvement scheme this year.  The local authorities were clearly advised that any requests for funds would be subject to their capacity to complete any proposed works in 2017 and funding availability.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme was launched on 21 September on the basis of the information received back from the local authorities.  It was not possible to support fully the level of demand which the local authorities stated they could deliver in 2017, but all eligible local authorities received a minimum of &euro;250,000, with the exception of the three authorities that requested less than that amount.  It is now a matter for the local authorities to determine which roads they wish to prioritise from the funding allocated to them.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Rural and Community Development, I am very much aware of the importance of the local improvement scheme.  The roads covered by the scheme give access to homes, farmyards, agricultural land and business premises, and are often heavily used.  However, because they fall outside direct local authority control, many need upgrading.  For emergency services too, bad road surfaces can lead to delays in accessing sites and tending to people in need.<\/p>  <p>  We have not been in a position to fund the local improvement scheme adequately in recent years, but we have now honoured the commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government and in the Action Plan for Rural Development to reinstate the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Given the consultation which my Department engaged in with the local authorities in determining what they could deliver in 2017, I urge local authorities to implement the programme and spend the money allocated to them without delay.<\/p>  <p>  The priority is to fund projects which can be completed during 2017 and I am not in a position to extend the deadline for the drawdown of moneys if we are to achieve this objective.

We need to build on that and make a case for funding to address tertiary roads in coming years, as was done in the past.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the challenges the Government has regarding funding.  There is a commitment to rural areas through the Department of Rural and Community Development.  We recently saw what Culture Night did to invigorate certain areas, including Bruree, Rathkeale, Newcastle West, Abbeyfeale and Kildimo in County Limerick.  I know the town and village renewal scheme will be coming up.  Rathkeale, which has a unique socioeconomic background, would be greatly enhanced by such schemes.  I look forward to its roll-out.  As late as this week we heard that Eir is continuing to roll out rural broadband to 300,000 houses, including in County Limerick.  We know we are down to two bidders for the roll-out of the State broadband of the remaining 500,000.  The Government is acting on what it is saying.  It is putting things in place because the economy is now able to afford it.  That is the bottom line.

The programme for Government made a commitment to open the scheme.  We have honoured that commitment and we will continue with that scheme next year.<\/p>  <p>  We talked to the local authorities.  They requested that they could spend the money this year and I hope they will.  County Limerick got &euro;411,000; it had sought &euro;1.716 million.  I know the local authority will spend that money by the end of the year to address badly needed road repairs.  As I said in my reply, these are roads people, in some cases ambulance drivers, doctors and nurses, use on a daily basis.  Therefore these schemes are very important and this particular LIS is a very important scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In the past year we have opened up the CL&Aacute;R programme.  The town and village scheme is up and running as is the rural recreation scheme.  Many schemes that assist rural areas are now operating.  Next year we will be into a new year.

We have heard a lot from the Government about its strides in increasing mental health funding from the low base that it was at for many years, but how much of that money is being spent on an annual basis and how much is being returned?  A total of &euro;16 million for just one area is huge and particularly when that area is not providing quality care according to the report or at the least is failing in a number of regards.<\/p>  <p>  In response to a recent parliamentary question, the HSE advised that all money for 2017 was allocated and would be used.

For many years the mental health service has been the poor relation in the health service.  It has a bit of stigma attached to it and people do not ask too many questions or probe too much.  It is time to end that and to probe into the issue to find out exactly what is going on because there is clearly a serious problem given the amount of money that is being returned.

I come here with a very heavy heart.  As Deputy Martin Kenny is aware, I lost a very close friend.  This morning, the Taoiseach said on Leaders' Questions that many people have been affected by suicide.  As the two previous Deputies have said, this report is damning in every respect.  A total of &euro;17.67 million was returned, &euro;4.57 million in 2012, some &euro;6.91 million in 2013 and &euro;6.19 million in 2014.  This report was carried out by three very eminent people from the Northern Ireland health care sector, namely, Mr. Brendan Mullen, Dr. Nial Quigley and Mr. Don Bradley.  I am sure the Minister of State has read the report.  The language in it is appalling.  There are 27 recommendations.  I know the Minister of State is a genuine man.

In 2015, the mental health division of the executive determined that it was necessary to conduct an independent review of the quality, safety and governance of Roscommon mental health services to support achieving the goals set out in A Vision for Change and other relevant national policies.<\/p>  <p>  Within a short period of being commissioned, it became evident that the initial timeframe proposed to conduct the review was insufficient and the review team requested, and received, extra time to complete its work.  I welcome the recently published comprehensive report, which makes 27 recommendations for local service improvement.  The report indicates that the review team was impressed by the majority of staff it met or interviewed, and was struck by their commitment to see services improve for service users in Roscommon.  The overriding concern of the majority of those interviewed - staff, service users and carers - was that patients and families in Roscommon were not receiving services in line with current best practice that would meet required quality and safety of care standards.<\/p>  <p>  Multidisciplinary team working - the linchpin of modern mental health services - was severely eroded in Roscommon, with fractured relationships within the area management team, within the Roscommon teams and between a number of professionals and key consultant medical staff.  Throughout, there were poor line management arrangements.  Leadership at a number of levels appeared to be ineffective.  The majority of nursing staff interviewed believed, and the team agrees, that the senior nursing leadership critical to representing the professional views of nurses at the executive level was missing.  It is the team's view that, in some instances, relationships appear to have broken down irreparably.<\/p>  <p>  Managers in any organisation have a difficult balancing role and they should be allowed to manage without undue interference.  However, that can only occur in a working environment that is conducive to mutual respect and understanding.  There was clear evidence that this was absent in this instance.  The review team pointed to the need for effective application of change management principles as a new entity attempts to merge disparate parts of hitherto separate organisations.  The team believes that preparatory work to support the area management team should have been in place, as it embarked on creating a new culture.  The team concluded also that there was disproportionate focus, even at a time of straitened financial circumstances, on achieving budget savings at the cost of an adequately staffed and safe service.<\/p>  <p>  The report highlights that approximately &euro;17.6 million of mental health funding for the years 2012 to 2014 was returned by the Galway-Roscommon area, and it details the context surrounding that.  The report makes a specific recommendation on the issue, to the effect that the HSE should have greater delegation of budgetary authority to promote greater accountability, better management and more effective service delivery at local level.  The HSE has confirmed that funds unspent in a particular area may be reallocated elsewhere within mental health services, and that is the case here.<\/p>  <p>  A team has been formed by the HSE to implement the recommendations of the report.  The executive has statutory responsibility for the planning and delivery of health care services at local level, including mental health in Roscommon.  Nonetheless, the Deputies can rest assured that I, and the Department of Health, will closely monitor the progress of the HSE implementation team to ensure that all the recommendations are delivered as quickly as possible to address at local or national level, as appropriate, all concerns raised by this important report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700034#GG00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1506527100,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The second point concerns allegations of conspiracy.  I cannot see anything in the report to suggest mental health services are being \"delivered in a consistent and timely fashion\".  The report refers to corruption, secrecy and acceptance of poor standards.  As Deputy Eugene Murphy and my party colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, said, this is a 43-page document and it is absolutely pathetic in this day and age that we as public representatives have to come in here and fight to represent the people that are trying to use this service when everything in the system is corrupt.  Some of the people concerned would not even engage in the review.  That is how bad it is.  The mental health services in this country upset me so much.

Lyme disease is an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium called borrelia burgdorferi.  It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The health protection surveillance centre of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating.  Many infected people have no symptoms at all.  The most common noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called <i>erythema migrans<\/i>- a red, raised skin rash, often called a bulls-eye rash.  People can also complain of flu-like symptoms such as headache, sore throat, neck stiffness, fever, muscle aches and general fatigue.<\/p><p>Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person&rsquo;s body in response to the infection.  In general, it is accepted clinical practice in Ireland, the UK, Europe and North America that laboratory confirmation is unnecessary for a confidently made, clinical diagnosis of <i>erythema migrans<\/i>.<\/p><p>In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America in 2006.  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.<\/p><p>Misinformation concerning the long-term effects of Lyme disease is causing real harm to people who may seek inappropriate treatments.  There is no evidence that viable <i>borrelia burgdorferi <\/i>persists in patients following confirmed Lyme disease.  I am aware of people travelling to other countries and spending large amounts of money on treatment for so called &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot;.  Chronic Lyme disease lacks an accepted clinical definition, and in practice the term has been applied to a wide variety of patients.  These symptoms are very common in the general population, and the evidence does not show that they occur any more commonly in patients with a history of Lyme disease.  The diverse natures of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions.  The majority of patients referred for chronic Lyme disease have no objective evidence of the infection, and most often have an alternative medical diagnosis or a functional syndrome such as fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome.  As diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease are available in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland, there is no need for anyone to travel abroad to access them.  I advise anyone suffering from these symptoms to seek advice from their family doctor and referral for appropriate evidence-based treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700035#HH00600","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1506527700,"counter":530,"content":"<p>What I am going to say is in no way a personal attack on the Minister of State, but I am outraged at that response.

There are 8,000 people who will tonight sleep in emergency accommodation, 3,000 of whom are children.  Many of those families with children will spend more than two years in inappropriate emergency accommodation and as the Minister knows, because we have reminded him repeatedly, those figures do not include adults and children in Department of Children and Youth Affairs-funded domestic violence refuge and step-down accommodation nor do they include the families trapped in direct provision, despite the fact that they have got their leave to remain.  We have 90,000 households on council waiting lists as of last September and I am sure those figures are already starting to rise yet again.  In many local authority areas, the length of time families are waiting for a local authority allocation is in excess of ten years.  Thousands of people and households are stuck in an affordability trap with rising rents, rising house prices and, of course, rising land values.<\/p><p>Increasingly, we have problems with insecure tenure in the private rental sector and, far too often, poor standards despite the high prices.  We know the private sector is building nowhere close to what its real capacity is or indeed its planning permissions and its funding.  In other key areas, Traveller accommodation budgets are still appallingly underspent by local authorities and people with disabilities, both in the social and private housing sector, by and large continue to be ignored.  Every single piece of our housing system is broken in a way that is worse than before.<\/p><p>I have no doubt that when the Minister gets to his feet he will tell Members that he inherited a housing crisis from the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  He will tell us they did not have the funds to invest in social housing from 2011 to 2014 but since the Kelly plan and then the Coveney plan, things are allegedly getting back on track.  The Minister will tell us that the numbers of planning permissions and commencements are up.  He may even repeat the mistruth that money is not an object in tackling the housing crisis but in all the indicators I have outlined, the Department's own figures tell a very different story.  More importantly, the lived experience of thousands of families contradicts the Minister.<\/p><p>The truth is the Government's housing plan simply is not working and unfortunately, in certain areas it is actually making things worse.  When the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, took office I told him that if and when he introduced measures that Sinn F&eacute;in believed would start to tackle the causes of the crisis I would support him but if he continued to pursue failed policies or indeed introduce even worse ones, we would hold him to account.<\/p><p>While in my view it is too early to judge the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, there are some very worrying signs.  His predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, promised much but delivered very little.  If he had put as much effort into social housing and affordable housing supply as he did to organising fancy launches and publishing glossy documents, he might have had more success.<\/p><p>However, there are some signs that the Minister is following in his predecessor's footsteps.  I have a document to hand, which I am happy to give to him after the debate.  In the past two and a half months, he has made either directly or indirectly through leaks from his Department 49 separate policy announcements.  I do not know if the Minister has approved all of those but they are 49 different measures and proposed changes to Rebuilding Ireland.  We were told there would be a review.  We were told there would be a publication of a review document but it seems that what the Minister is doing is launching and half leaking new ideas and proposals to give the impression that he is doing something when I am yet to be convinced that anything is being done at all.  Eighteen of these actions were announced after the homeless summit on 8 September.  Some of them are not bad ideas.  Some were measures that were already announced and some, particularly those that increased the administrative burden on the Residential Tenancies Board and local authorities, will simply make matters worse.<\/p><p>There are 31 different leaks of different policy propositions and either the Minister is consenting to them being leaked by his Department or he is not in control of other members of his party or the Department who are leaking these without his consent.  What is crucial, however, is when we look at the picture of those 49 measures, there is no coherence to any of that whatsoever.  It smacks of a Minister desperate to give the impression of action when, unfortunately, he is continuing on the same path as his predecessor.<\/p><p>The central problem with the plan the Minister inherited from the latter is that it targeted - or planned to target - the social housing needs of 130,000 families over six years but, as the he is aware, only 37,000 of these will be housed through real social housing.  Some 93,000 families, according to the Minister's plan, will allegedly have their housing needs met in the private rental sector, 83,000 through two-year HAP tenancies and 10,000 through longer-term leases.  This means that 72% of the Minister's plan for social housing in the State relies on subsidised private rental accommodation.<\/p> <p> Capital investment in real social housing remains - this will continue to be the case under the plan - unacceptably low: &euro;733 million this year and &euro;788 million next year.  Throughout the lifetime of the plan, if the Minister meets his targets, it will not go above the level at which it was before Fine Gael took office in 2011.  With low investment comes low output: 2,541 real, new additional social units for the system in 2016, not including the voids; 3,684 this year, not including the voids; and next year we are promised somewhere in the region of more than 5,000.  This is less than half of the 10,000 real social housing units that the cross-party Committee on Housing and Homelessness, which was supported by members of the Minister's own party, strongly recommended.  To make matters worse, the Department continues to impose an 18-to-24-month approval process in local authorities, slowing down the delivery of these much-needed homes.  In fact, even for the alleged rapid-builds, the approval process is 12 months before a contractor goes on site.  Meanwhile, there is no direct central government investment in the provision of affordable rental or affordable purchase housing, and the current schemes, whether the help-to-buy model or the local infrastructure housing activation fund, are either not having any positive impact on affordability or are making matters worse.  The cost-rental model is nowhere to be seen.  Meanwhile, good projects such as &Oacute; Cualann project in Poppintree, which the Minister visited to have his photograph taken, are not getting any significant backing from central government funds, despite the fact that good-quality family homes at prices of between &euro;170,000 and &euro;225,000 are on offer there.  Why does this Government believe that social and affordable housing need can be met by giving public money to private landlords and private developers?  At what point will it accept that the best way to meet this need is for direct State investment in public housing on public land?<\/p> <p> The motion before us is straightforward.  We could have proposed many other things in it but really what we wanted to do was to focus on four key propositions.  The first is, yet again, to urge the Minister to put the money on the table in the capital programme in order to deliver the minimum of 10,000 real social housing units each year, starting next year.  The second is for direct State investment in affordable rental and affordable purchase housing, either delivered directly through local authorities or between local authorities and approved housing bodies on the model of the &Oacute; Cualann project.  The third is to take more direct action - something that is sorely lacking in the 18 points the Minister launched after the much-hyped homelessness summit - to stop the flow of families into homelessness.  The Focus Ireland amendment is one key way of doing this, but we also urge the Minister to take more direct action to assist those in mortgage distress, including buy-to-let landlords who have rent-paying tenants in their properties, and to prevent those families from becoming homeless.  Finally, we seek a clear commitment that no individual, family or child will spend more than six months in emergency accommodation and that no one will be forced to sleep rough because of the absence of secure and safe emergency accommodation.  The latter have both been Government policy since 2008 but they have yet to be realised.<\/p> <p> To comment briefly on the amendments, there is much I agree with in the Labour, People Before Profit and Fianna F&aacute;il amendments, but Sinn F&eacute;in has taken the decision that we will not accept them.  This is not because we have huge disagreements with them, but, rather, because we want to keep the focus of this Private Members' business on the four key issues to which I refer.  We have some differences over the mechanics of how best to mobilise the assets and resources of NAMA.  There are some parts of the People Before Profit amendment that we think are just unrealistic in the short term and some aspects of the Fianna F&aacute;il measure with which we do not necessarily agree, although we accept the spirit of many of the amendments.<\/p> <p> The crucial thing is this: if the Minister comes back to us over the next couple of weeks with more leaks and announcements and then with a minor increase in capital expenditure on budget day, what he is essentially saying is that the core programme that was introduced by his predecessor, Deputy Coveney, remains in place.  The truth of the Government's own figures is that the private sector cannot and will not meet the housing needs of people reliant on social, affordable rental housing or affordable purchase housing.  On that basis I urge the Minister to listen to what many of us in this House have been saying, listen to what the D&aacute;il Committee on Housing and Homeless is saying and change track.  If he does, he will be recognised for decades as the Minister who finally started to get a grip on the housing and homelessness crisis.  If he does not, he will go down on that long list of ministerial failures - including Deputies Coveney and Kelly and former Deputies Gormley and Finneran - before him.  They had the opportunity and failed because they would not invest in public housing on public land for those people who need social and affordable housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700037#NN00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506529200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I have just a couple of minutes so I will focus on just one or two things.  This is the big issue for all of us.  Not a week goes by that a new homeless family does not come to my constituency office.  The majority of the reasons that prompt people to come in are housing-related.  Sometimes they are people trying to get transfers.  I was dealing with a case in recent days involving a couple and seven children who live in a two-bed unit.  Again, they are trying to transfer - to move up.  I would argue that I live in one of the areas with probably one of the most progressive local authority housing agencies.  However, our biggest failure - this is what people say to us when they come to our constituency offices - is our lack of ambition.  There are probably 5,000 households on South Dublin County Council's list and it is proposed to build a couple of hundred houses.  If one looks at the numbers on lists throughout the country, they are similar.  We could talk of 90,000 in total but the figure is probably much higher.  In that context, it is proposed to build 36,000 units over the next six years.  We are failing our people.  We are not ambitious enough.  We are not meeting people's aspirations, needs, hopes or expectations<\/p>  <p>.  Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals are ambitious.  We believe they can work.  However, we need to start being more ambitious in our outlook.  That is what we are trying to do and that is why we are trying to focus on these four areas.  I do not think we can leave this to the market or to private companies that have ruthlessly taken advantage of the situation and people's vulnerability and that will continue to do so.  The lack of affordable and social housing is acutely affecting young people.  We know that.  Increasing numbers of people are coming into our offices.  I was at the National Youth Council's offices recently and, again, young people came to me and talked about the impact homelessness is having on families.  We are all talking about it, but I would argue that we are not ambitious enough and we need to start looking up rather than down at these figures.  I think we can deliver.  Collectively, I think there is the goodwill in the House to do so.  However, we need a plan that works, and I would argue that we need to approach the issue differently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700038#OO00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1506529200,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as ucht an deis labhairt ar an topaic seo.  The latest figures released by the Department show clearly that the Government's plans are not working; rather, they are failing miserably thousands and thousands of families around this country.  My party has consistently called for a range of measures to be implemented to address this crisis, which is spiralling out of control.  We have called for an increase in social housing stock to 10,000 units per year.  We have called for security of tenure and rent certainty to reduce the flow of families into homelessness.  We have called for a Government-led affordable housing scheme.  The piecemeal approach adopted by this Government has done nothing to address this crisis, which worsens day by day, and it is the families that are suffering and paying the price for the Government's failure.  There are now 8,000 people in emergency accommodation, and it is absolutely shocking and unacceptable to think that 3,000 of them are vulnerable children who have been placed in difficult situations.

In that time the only thing they can rightly claim credit for is the fact they allowed a housing crisis to escalate into a full-blown housing emergency.  They have opted to go for Mickey Mouse options, for half-baked options, so long as they were developer led and developer driven.  In doing that, they have prolonged and compounded the misery and uncertainty of homelessness and they have point-blank refused to accept that, unless there is a proper rollout of a State-wide, State-funded social and affordable housing building programme, they are not going to resolve this crisis.

We agree with the broad thrust of much of what is in the motion, because we believe that is exactly what is happening at the moment, but we cannot agree with the language.  We cannot agree with it when it says, for example, \"Rebuilding Ireland continues to over rely on the private sector to meet social and affordable housing need\".  When we look at the construction output for next year we know that, of the 20,000 homes that will be built, which is a conservative number, one quarter to one fifth will be social houses built by local authorities and housing bodies.  We cannot agree with how Sinn F&eacute;in manipulates the numbers either.  While the motion points to some indicators, I can point to others that show Rebuilding Ireland is working.  There has been a greater than 40% increase in planning permissions since last year, a greater than 40% increase in the number of commencement construction notices over last year and an increase of 33% in the number of homes connected to the ESB grid since last year.  Those figures tell us that activity is happening - of course it is.  When we approach this debate, we have to be even-handed in the language we use but also in regard to the figures we rely on to talk about what is actually happening out there today in the world.<\/p>  <p>  When we look at some of the new measures that have been brought in under Rebuilding Ireland, like the fast-track planning process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it is important to note there are now 5,000 homes on the books through that fast-track planning process.  That is 5,000 homes that will be built more quickly because of new measures that were brought in.<\/p>  <p>  In so far as my analysis or review of Rebuilding Ireland is concerned, Deputy &Oacute; Broin should not mind the leaks.  I am taking a very collaborative approach to the work I am doing.  I am talking to everyone I can and listening to them.  I am considering as much as I can.  I am not ruling anything out or anything in until I make a decision on it.  If others choose to talk to others about that, and it makes its way into the media, I cannot control that.  What the Deputy can rely on is the rolling analysis I am doing.  When I make a decision and announce it, as I did in the course of the housing summit, that is the change or improvement that happens.  It is similar in regard to the change to the rent pressure zones and in regard to the change that will be made in regard to the Residential Tenancies Board.<\/p>  <p>  We have a crisis in homelessness and we have a shortage of houses - we know that.  Many European neighbours are facing a similar situation today as well, such as France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands.  The Netherlands has a constitutional right to housing in its constitution but that does not mean it does not have a problem with homelessness and housing.  Thankfully, we still have one of the lowest rates of homelessness among member states.  Scotland is almost double our rate and Germany is more than double.  While that is nothing to be proud of, we are putting in a huge amount of resources and effort to try to help people and families in very difficult circumstances.  One homeless family is one family too many.  The Taoiseach has said it is a stain on our society and I agree with him on that.  Thankfully, though, we are helping these people as much as we can.  At times, we will do everything we can to support a homeless individual and put in every single support we can, and it will not be enough, but that does not mean we should not try harder, which we do, although we know we need to do more.  This year, more than &euro;100 million will be spent on homelessness, which is more than double what was spent in 2014, and that does not include the &euro;25 million that was allocated for hubs, the additional &euro;10 million that I approved earlier this year and the additional &euro;10 million that has been ring-fenced since then for family hubs.<\/p>  <p>  I was in Limerick this morning to attend a two-day conference of the social housing bodies as well as local authority representatives.  I know from the local authority in Limerick that it will be drawing down that funding for two new hubs in Limerick.  It intends to have almost all families out of hotels and bed and breakfasts before Christmas as a result of the work it is doing and the funding we are providing.<\/p><p>Consider the Mater Dei facility, which the Oireachtas committee was invited to attend, and which the vast majority of Members have not attended.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has attended there - fair play to him for his engagement - but most Members have not.  Of the 27 families that went to that new facility in June, half have moved on to more permanent accommodation.  Others are, unfortunately, having difficulties finding accommodation.  Different families have different needs and we must be sensitive to them.  If they need a tailored response that takes more time then we will do that for them.  We have nine family hubs in place at the moment that look after 300 families.  We aim to have a total of 15 hubs.  I repeat this is the first response.  It is not a long-term source of accommodation.  It is a better response than hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation.  It is a first response for those families.<\/p> <p> While we support the broad thrust of the motion, I cannot give the commitment called for in the motion: \"to give a clear commitment that no family with children will be left in emergency accommodation for more than six months...\".  We must be sensitive to families' needs and we have to make sure that in finding them permanent, sustainable accommodation we take into account the different needs they have and we come forward with tailored solutions.  The motion also says \"that no person will be forced to sleep rough due to lack of safe and appropriate emergency accommodation.\"  Again, sometimes we can do everything we can but it still will not be enough.  There will be 200 more beds in place by the end of the year and this figure will have a spare capacity in it to make sure that nobody has to sleep rough.  It is important that we do this.<\/p> <p> The numbers of those who have come out of emergency accommodation show there have been 3,000 sustainable exits from homelessness in 2016.  In the first quarter of 2017 there were 900.  In the second quarter I hope to see the same.  At the end of the housing summit I announced the new inter-agency group, to be chaired by John Murphy the former Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The group will co-ordinate the funding and resources that go in to homelessness.  It is not just about shelter and emergency accommodation, it is about a range of issues.  We have exit co-ordinators coming in to place also to prevent people falling back into homelessness.  This is important and it was welcomed.<\/p> <p> We also have a national director for Housing First coming and an additional 100 places for Housing First.  This was all welcomed.  There is also the new agreement whereby landlords must write to the RTB to notify it when they are issuing a notice to quit.  This allows the RTB and the services to get involved to prevent people having to access emergency accommodation, to either keep people in the homes they are in or to help them in to new accommodation.  There is also the roll-out of the new HAP place finder service across the State, which is doing a good job where it is available.<\/p> <p> If we look at the details of the motion and the provision of 10,000 houses for local authorities arrived at, when I talk about the figures I want to be quite accurate so people will understand what I am talking about.  Because of a decision that was made a few weeks ago, 3,800 houses will be built directly by local authorities and housing bodies.  This is a 30% increase on what we were going to build next year.  When we count in Part V provision as well as the voids that will be converted, we are looking at 5,000 homes next year.  The figures for acquisitions and leasing will be an additional 3,000.  This is 8,000.  The Deputies have spoken of 10,000 for 2018; we will get 8,000.  With regard to those acquisitions and leasing figures, we will have the acquisitions in stock and the leases will be long-term leases.  We will have those.  When we look at the 20,000 homes that are going to be built next year, we look at the new accommodation coming online, we can point to a 20% to 25%, or perhaps even more, that will be social housing homes for tenants who need those supports.  This is because new money is made available and new money is re-prioritised.  I am having conversations with the Minister for Finance and he has assured me that additional resources will be made available for our capital spend from 2019 on to make sure we can increase our ambition.<\/p> <p> In addition, in 2018 some 17,000 new tenancies will be supported through HAP.  This year 21,000 social housing homes will be through this range of measures.  This is 80 new tenancies per working day of the week across the year.  Next year we will see 8,000 homes from the build programme, acquisition and leasing and the 17,000 that will be available through HAP.  That is 25,000 social housing supports next year.  This is significant and is well beyond the 10,000 figure the Deputies are talking about delivering.  It is important to point this out.<\/p> <p> The motion also makes reference to the new measures to stop the flow of people into homelessness.  I have already spoken of some of the outcomes of the housing summit, which I believe are very positive.  The rent pressure zones, while a temporary solution, have worked.  If the trends continue for the first and second quarters of this year we will see an average inflation rate of 3% in Dublin.  It was 8.5 % last year.  This will help families to stay in their tenancies.  I have announced a definition of substantial refurbishment that is coming.  We are working on this with the RTB, and other services are going to feed in to that definition.  If I need to put it on a statutory footing I would have no problem in doing that.<\/p> <p> A change management programme has been developed for two years to turn the RTB into a proper regulator.  We also need balance and we must recognise that we cannot force anybody to be a landlord.  People need to be incentivised to do this and they need supports, especially where there are accidental landlords or where people are thinking of selling on as a vacant possession.  We must see if there are things we can do to make sure that landlords sell to landlords.  If Deputies want to cry foul over the number of international institutional investors that have come in to invest in the rental sector, we must make sure that if we are trying to get them to exit there are going to be enough domestic landlords in place to take on that role.<\/p> <p> Today in Limerick I announced that a housing body will use the new mortgage to rent scheme to help people whose mortgages are in distress of more than 720 days to stay in their homes as social housing tenants.  This will help them and they are going to get a debt write off too, which is welcome.  For the last nine consecutive quarters the numbers of people in long-term arrears has been reducing.  The measures that were already in place have been working.  We can, however, always bring about new solutions.  We reviewed the mortgage to rent scheme earlier this year and we now have a housing body taking advantage of the changes that were made.  More changes are going to come also.<\/p> <p> I cannot, regrettably, address all the points in the motion that I had wanted to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700039#PP01100","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506530400,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The Minister will have another chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700040#QQ00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1506530400,"counter":555,"content":"<p>We must also be careful in terms of what we say to the public as to what we believe is possible.

Fianna F&aacute;il has submitted its own amendment to the motion, which we welcome.  It provides a list of practical and workable solutions that would have a real effect on alleviating the crisis.<\/p><p>It is over one year since the Rebuilding Ireland report was launched but there has been little, if any, progress.  Despite the huge demand and the unprecedented levels of unmet housing needs the State is still building and providing historically low levels of affordable and social housing.  All the while the number of homeless families continues to rise dramatically, jumping fivefold in just two years.  Homelessness is a great national shame.  It is the greatest problem facing the State, and one of the largest problems our State has ever faced.  We cannot give in to cynicism and despair.  There are solutions.  We have housed large numbers of our citizens in previous decades when we had much fewer resources.  There is no reason why the State cannot do so again.  We need to come together and make a concerted effort to fix this issue.  No measures should be considered too big or too small in getting on top of the housing calamity.<\/p><p>While the rise in homelessness continued unabated over the past year, which is a consequence of the failure of Government policies to get to grips with the affordability problem in the housing sector more generally, the plight of families living in emergency accommodation has also worsened significantly.  It is a shocking indictment of the Government that is does not consider re-housing these families, even in more suitable temporary accommodation, to be enough of a priority.<\/p><p>It is well known that living in hotels is having an impact on these families.  Meeting these targets should not be considered a budgetary issue.  I want to put on record that these targets have to be met and should be met.  Whatever funding is required to meet these targets should be automatically made available.  Hotels are not a place to raise a child for any length of time but many families have been living in these for a year and more in many cases.<\/p><p>The strategy of using HAP as the primary means of moving families out of emergency homelessness cannot be considered a success and absolutely must be revised.  Homeless HAP, the Government&rsquo;s flagship housing scheme to move homeless households in to privately provided rental properties, is failing drastically to provide secure accommodation for homeless households and move them out of emergency accommodation.<\/p><p>With regard to social homes being built, less than 800 new social homes will be constructed in 2017 when the action plan in Rebuilding Ireland targets 5,000.  Only 24% of the 10,000 units that we are led to believe are in the construction pipeline are on site.  It will be 2021 before many of these units come on stream compared to the already too low target of 26,000 that we are told will come to fruition.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s core social housing strategy has been to rely almost entirely on the private rented market for social housing provision, through the HAP scheme.<\/p><p>Last year, more than 75% of new social housing tenancies were placed in the private rental market.  This strategy is reflected in the overall housing budget.  While the total housing budget is just 24% below the 2008 level to which the Minister has just referred, the capital housing budget is a full 51% below the 2008 level.  Nevertheless, we are told, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has already stated, that money is not the problem and that local authorities and approved housing bodies are adequately resourced should projects be available.  That is not the case.  This misguided strategy is exacerbating the housing supply problem with local authority tenants competing against households at the low end of the market.  No new social housing supply is being added.  While the greatest impact is on families who are eligible for social housing, housing supply across the board is affected.<\/p> <p> Traditionally, the State and local authorities have acted as the largest single house builder in the country, adding significant levels of new supply annually.  I am afraid that under Fine Gael Governments, this situation has been completely reversed.  The absence of new supply from the State affects all in the search for affordable housing.  This is due to the strategy of relying solely, or at least to the extent of 75%, on social renting through HAP rather than on building new social schemes.  That has to change.  The social housing budget must be increased to the 2008 levels, which it is currently 50% below.<\/p> <p> While the Rebuilding Ireland report contains many positive proposals on housing supply more generally, many are not being implemented.  This must change to a significant extent and a difference must be made in tackling the crisis.  Recent trends, including continued rent inflation, reduced rental supply and an acceleration of house price inflation in 2017 are evidence that the plan is failing the key litmus test of expanding new housing supply and improving affordability.  It is not acceptable that the Government has ignored the targets for housing delivery and output and continues to miss them while problems grow deeper and more entrenched every week.  We reject absolutely the view that no intervention is required to stimulate the supply of residential construction.  Given the level of pent-up demand, the targeted output of 25,000 new units by 2021 is wholly inadequate.  The State can only build approximately 18,000 new units this year whereas we need in the region of 50,000 to make a dent in affordability.  Just 4,000 of these units will be apartments notwithstanding the fact that there is huge demand for such accommodation in high-pressure areas such as Dublin and other cities.<\/p> <p> There are significant market failures in housing including in respect of planning, the distribution and cost of finance, infrastructure deficits and, of course, the cost of construction.  The market requires State intervention in order that these failures can be overcome.  To ensure that supply translates into more affordable rents and house prices, we must incentivise directly the building of affordable owner-occupier housing and affordable rental housing.  New financial incentives to build high-density developments must also be considered.  Dublin City Council and others argue there is a need to consider urgently incentives to get builders to begin an intensive house building programme on lands that are already zoned residential.  While hotel, office and student accommodation is being built, very little ordinary residential construction is taking place because it is not commercially viable due to the costs associated with construction.  While a reduction in the rate of VAT for houses built and sold at affordable price points is roundly condemned by many, it is just one proposal to help stimulate the greater supply of more affordable housing.  To ensure that new supply translates to affordable rent and house price levels, we must incentivise the building of affordable owner-occupier and affordable rental housing.  This is the only way to make housing more affordable for lower and middle-income households, in particular in the high pressure zones in Dublin, Cork and, indeed, beyond.<\/p> <p> One of the first actions Fine Gael and the Labour Party took on coming to power was to abolish in 2012 affordable housing for low and middle-income workers under Part V.  This must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Affordable housing has always been a key pillar of any housing programme put forward by Government.  I implore the Government to bring forward a new affordable housing scheme to meet the demand out there, to provide the necessary supply and create a market which provides more affordability.  This would reduce competition between those who do not need to be in competing positions.  The State must take responsibility and increase expenditure on social housing to the levels mentioned earlier.  If it does, we might see some results and success.  I would hope, thereafter, to be in a position to commend the House on playing its part to ensure that progress was made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700040#QQ00400","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1506531000,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Cassells and Curran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017092700041#RR00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1506531000,"counter":559,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It is depressing, a scandal and wrong.  What frustrates me most is a first-time Deputy is that it does not need to be this way.  I have stated repeatedly that this D&aacute;il will be judged on its response to the housing crisis.  I have not changed that view.  In fact, I consider that both Parliament and the Executive will be judged on our response to housing.<\/p>  <p>  As we stand here again tonight, I take no pleasure in stating that we are failing the Irish people in the politics of housing policy.  It is now obvious that our Fine Gael-led Government does not get the seriousness of the crisis.  The reason for that was demonstrated perfectly in the Chamber yesterday when the Taoiseach outlined his and his party's views on property rights.  The Fine Gael view is that this is a temporary crisis that requires minimum intervention before we return to a market-based speculative treatment of housing.  This view is wrong in its analysis and it is the reason Fine Gael's attempts to resolve the housing crisis have been too timid and have failed in every pillar of a well-spun but poorly delivered Rebuilding Ireland.  Fianna F&aacute;il's position is radically different.  We have learned the lessons of the past and the key lesson on housing is that the State, whose representatives are elected by and accountable to the people, must have permanent control, oversight and responsibility for ensuring that there are homes for all.<\/p>  <p>  The basic starting point is the European norm.  In Europe, the norm is public and affordable housing supply, as well as affordable ownership and rental homes.  This constitutes a key responsibility of most European states, which are proactive in housing provision.  Fianna F&aacute;il's response will involve moving the Irish State, through central and local government, permanently into this space.  We should do this responsibly but also radically through sustainable funding, both on and off-balance sheet, for the building of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase by working families.  We want to ensure that local authorities and the Department are empowered and resourced, not only to deliver these homes but, crucially, to manage them into the future.<\/p>  <p>  The investment required in housing supply is massive and far beyond what the private sector can manage.  Investment in our housing stock must be considered in the context of managing that investment and ensuring that the quality of new housing is such that we spend public moneys not only with a view to addressing an urgent social need but also to the economic and long-term strategic return for the taxpayer.  It is vital in the context of the State's role in housing that publicly-owned land is retained for public investment in housing.  It is wrong to provide public lands to private developers for the construction of private housing.  It makes no investment sense whatsoever.  The State has enough land to build significant numbers of mixed-tenure housing units.
