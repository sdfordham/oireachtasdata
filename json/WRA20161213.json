The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.  Since 1993, there have been significant developments and improvements in the pay and conditions of military personnel.  The Representative Associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them in line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department continue to work with the Representative Associations in a positive and collaborative process within the C and A Scheme which points to the effectiveness of the scheme for resolving IR issues. It is open to the Representative Associations to submit claims to the Official side in relation to matters falling within the C and A scheme, generally claims relate to pay and conditions, award of allowances etc.  When submitted these claims are generally the subject of negotiations and where agreement is not reached it is open to both sides to seek the assistance of an adjudicator to settle the matter. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the parallel process referred to by the Deputy, I should firstly outline that under the terms of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990 the Defence Forces Representative Associations are prohibited from being associated with, or affiliated to any trade unions, or any other body without the consent of the Minister. Accordingly, the Representative Associations cannot be affiliated to ICTU at present.  The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  This is a long standing policy position taken by respective Governments since the foundation of the State.  The Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action.  The potential for serious difficulties and conflicts could arise in these circumstances if the Defence Forces Representative Associations were associated with, or affiliated to ICTU, given ICTU rules in relation to such matters.However, a number of mechanisms have been put in place through the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme which provides the Representative Associations with structures and processes, which enable them to make representations and negotiate on behalf of their members.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level. <\/p>  <p>  I have recently received a detailed submission from RACO in which they put forward their views and recommendations in relation to the future development of both processes.

I should point out at the outset that this is simply a proposal from the Commission.  It has not been discussed or agreed by the member States or the European Parliament.  As such, it has yet to go through the wide ranging and extensive EU procedures before any part of it becomes a reality.  The aim of the Plan is to explore how EU policies and instruments can ensure that the EU&rsquo;s industrial and skills base will be able to deliver required defence capabilities in view of current and future security challenges.  As part of this Plan, the Commission has proposed the creation of a European Defence Fund.   There are also proposals in the Plan to increase transparency in relation to Defence procurement.   <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Defence Fund is to promote research and innovation and contribute to the strengthening of the European defence technological and industrial base, and to further stimulate the development of key defence capabilities.  The Commission has proposed that the fund would have research and capability windows. <\/p>  <p>Under the research window, it is proposed that &euro;90 million in funding will be made available for collaborative defence research projects over the period 2017-2020 in what is known as the &ldquo;Preparatory Action&rdquo;.  The 2017 allocation of &euro;25 million has already been approved.  The Commission also propose that post 2020, a European Defence Research Programme will be established which will require funding of &euro;500m per annum.  It should be noted that this has yet to be negotiated as part of the post 2020 Multiannual Financial Framework.<\/p>  <p>  Under the capability window, the Commission has proposed the establishment of a fund which would facilitate Member States in purchasing capability platforms together through the pooling of national contributions and where possible supported by the EU Budget.  The Commission estimate that this fund would be in the region of &euro;5 billion per year.  Any capabilities developed as a result of this plan would continue to be owned by the relevant Member State.  It is important to highlight that this would depend on Member States agreeing to initiate joint projects which they would co-fund from national resources.   <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the proposals contained in the Plan, in particular in relation to the creation of European Defence Fund, have yet to be defined in full and negotiated with Member States.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300058#WRA02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300058#WRA03000"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[39838\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300058#WRA03100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he attended the European Council joint session of Defence and Foreign Affairs on 14 November 2016, at which the implementation of the EU global strategy in the area of security and defence was discussed; his views on the Council conclusions adopted at this meeting regarding the deepening of defence co-operation between EU states, particularly in view of Ireland's stated policy of military neutrality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>I attended the recent joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Council along with my colleague Minister Dara Murphy who represented Minister Flanagan, at the meeting.

The work of this Division includes supporting the  Cabinet Committee on Brexit and the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs.<\/p>  <p>  Work on Brexit is also supported by the Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who now have a greater role in EU matters overall, with a newly created EU Division and the existing Division dealing with Anglo Irish affairs both having important roles to play.<\/p>  <p>  Across Government, relevant Departments, agencies and overseas missions are being strengthened to deal with Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300059#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Data","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300059#WRB01800"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[39352\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300059#WRB01900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of State boards under the remit of his Department or its agencies in tabular form; the total number of members of each board; the number of women on each board; and the percentage of each board that is made up of women.","asker":"1257","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>Table<table><tr><th>No <\/th><th>Board<\/th><th>Total Members <\/th><th>Number of Women<\/th><th>% of Women<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>1<\/td><td>National Statistics Board (NSB)<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>37.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2<\/td><td>National Economic and Social Council (NESC)<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>Term of Office expired.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300059#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300059#WRB02100"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[39477\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300059#WRB02200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the total photography costs for his Department per annum since March 2011 inclusive of costs incurred from use of the ministerial allowance in tabular form; the occasions for which photographers were booked; the photographers used; the breakdown of costs associated with each occasion that a photographer was used; if there is a policy regarding the booking of photographers within his department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>The total expenditure by my Department on photography from 9 March 2011 to 7 December 2016 is provided in the following table:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Amount spent on photography<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2011 (9 March to December )<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;28,069<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;13,449<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>Department       -     &euro;6,778<br \/><br \/>EU Presidency  -     &euro;38,172<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;12,750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td><br \/><br \/>&euro;9,820<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>1 January to 7 December 2016 <\/td><td>&euro;22,805.60<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The increase in costs for 2016 over 2015 is due to a requirement to have an official record of the ceremonies to mark the centenary of  Easter 1916 and other historic Commemoration events.  <\/p><p>Photography costs in my Department have reduced significantly in recent years.

I will be working closely with my Government colleagues in the coming months towards achievement of these aims.<\/p>  <p>  A number of measures have already been put in place with the aim of providing assistance to those finding themselves in mortgage arrears. These include:<\/p>  <p>  - development of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) as the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop shop&rsquo; point of information and guidance for homeowners in mortgage arrears, working closely with the Insolvency Service;<\/p>  <p>  - establishment and staffing of Dedicated Mortgage Arrears centres in key locations with nationwide coverage, which offer specialised expertise on mortgage debt;<\/p>  <p>  - the presence of MABS and the Insolvency Service at courthouses to provide information and &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; support for householders issued with repossession proceedings involving their homes (operating nationwide since 1 October last, following a successful pilot scheme in July 2015).  This initiative is facilitated by the Courts Service, and is currently provided for all Circuit Court repossession hearings.<\/p>  <p>  I should also mention the new, innovative mortgage arrears resolution service - Abhaile - which the Minister for Social Protection and I officially launched recently.  The new nationwide service marks a departure in State assistance by providing free, independent expert advice and support on financial and legal issues.  The objective of the Scheme is to ensure that a person who is at risk of losing their home due to their mortgage arrears can access independent expert financial and legal advice, which will help them to identify their best options for returning to solvency - with priority to their remaining in the home, where that is a sustainable option. It aims, in particular, to reach those in arrears greater than 2 years.  The scheme started in late July and is already proving very effective.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, eligible clients are given vouchers to obtain expert advice from financial and legal advisers in order to resolve their debt issues.  In addition, they can get assistance in court where needed, have access to solicitors, and get help obtaining legal aid. Since the establishment of the scheme in July, over 2,100 home owners have received assistance.  A major Government information campaign will be launched in the coming weeks to raise awareness of the scheme.  I believe that the introduction of the scheme will help people get out of debt and, wherever possible, to stay in their own homes and would strongly encourage anyone worried about mortgage arrears on their home to contact MABS, the Government gateway for accessing free expert help and advice.<\/p>  <p>  This new service builds on the protections set out in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 which assists homeowners in mortgage arrears by granting the Circuit Court specific powers to adjourn repossession proceedings in order to allow such a borrower to consult with a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) with a view to making a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Insolvency Acts and to instruct the PIP to make such a proposal.  In addition, the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 has been enacted in order to further assist homeowners in mortgage arrears.  The Act has introduced a new \"court review\" process applicable in cases where creditors such as a lending institution refuse a proposal for a PIA drawn up to resolve the homeowner's debts, including the mortgage on their home.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Courts Bill 2016, currently before the Oireachtas, the position is that the Bill does not have any implications for applications for repossession of principal private residences by the banks and financial institutions.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 already gives the Circuit Court jurisdiction to deal with repossession proceedings involving principal private residences, irrespective of when the mortgage was created or the value of the property.  The Courts Bill 2016 does not seek to change that position in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300059#WRB05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300060#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[39386\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300060#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 130 of 1 December 2016, if she will address a matter (details supplied) regarding the reply.","asker":"1250","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the decision by Garda Representative Association and Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors members to accept the recommendation of the Labour Court which sought to address the concerns that have been articulated in relation to their pay and conditions, the pay and conditions of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies. <\/p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and has agreed to accept its recommendation. <\/p>  <p>  In making its recommendation the Court acknowledged the uncertainty that Garda members face in availing of approved annual leave due to the requirement to attend Court even at short notice when on annual leave, resulting in the cancellation of their leave and any plans they may have made.

J-ARC is a strategic response to the management of prolific offenders.  As part of this strategy a number of pilot initiatives have been developed to address the offenders' behaviour and reduce crime.

The times at which court hearings take place and the length of hearing days are matters falling within the responsibility of the judiciary.  Court hearing times are arranged to enable judges to prepare for the case, read the papers where appropriate in the case or cases listed before them for hearing and to complete other preparatory work associated with their lists.  Judges, in individual cases, regularly arrange earlier times for commencement of hearings and extend hearings beyond the usual finishing time to facilitate parties, witnesses and legal representatives, and to ensure hearings are completed within the time allocated to them in the court's calendar.<\/p>  <p>  Business is scheduled in so far as possible with a view to ensuring that the court has sufficient business for the full duration of a scheduled sitting.  The Court normally has no advance notice of matters that will not proceed, matters that will proceed as expected and matters that overrun their expected duration.  Inevitably, on occasions, cases listed for hearing may settle and the Court will finish early.  The Court, in scheduling cases, endeavours to strike a balance between managing the expectations of parties that their cases will get listed for hearing and the realistic possibility of such occurring.  The Presidents of the Courts, in consultation with the Courts Service, keep waiting times under regular review.  Where specific issues are identified additional judicial resources are targeted at the areas of greatest need.<\/p>  <p>  The Supreme Court continues to make significant progress in dealing with the backlog of cases awaiting hearing with the proactive review and management of its caseload under the direction of the Chief Justice.  Management of the Court of Appeal list is overseen by the President of the Court of Appeal and judges have been designated by him to actively manage both the civil and the criminal appeals list on a weekly basis to ensure cases are dealt with as efficiently as possible and delays are kept to a minimum.  The establishment of the Second Special Criminal Court this year has also impacted positively on waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  Waiting times in the High Court remain generally low and the President of the High Court continues to keep the waiting times under review and has introduced measures to assist in prompt disposal of cases.  New measures introduced in the Bail List have had a positive impact on hearings with almost all matters now heard on the first day listed or the following day resulting in improved case conclusion times as well as in significant efficiencies for the Irish Prison Service.  Waiting times in the Central Criminal Court have also been significantly reduced following the introduction by the President of a fifth sitting of the court.<\/p>  <p>  Sittings of Circuit and District Courts are being held as scheduled and waiting times are kept under ongoing review in consultation with the Presidents of the courts to ensure waiting times are kept to a minimum.  Earlier this year arrangements were put into place to redistribute the work of the District Court in Dublin to allow the use of three courtrooms in Chancery Street Courthouse for District Court Family Law child care business.  This increased from five to eight the available courtrooms in Dublin to hear family law matters in the District Court.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is my intention, subject to Government approval, to bring forward proposals in the coming months regarding a dedicated Family Court and issues relating to access to the Family Courts and optimising the use and availability of court time are likely arise for discussion in the course of discussions and consultations on those legislative proposals.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, a Family Law and Children Court complex is being developed which will include a new Supreme Court facility and accommodation for court offices.  The project will allow for the much needed replacement of facilities currently in Dolphin House, Phoenix House, &Aacute;ras U&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh and the Children Court in a single location with custom-built facilities and will also provide appropriate accommodation for the Supreme Court.<\/p>  <p>  I also intend to bring forward legislative proposals during 2017, in the form of a Civil Law and Courts (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which among other things will make provision for electronic case filing in the courts.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, a Criminal Procedure Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.

Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p>  <p>  I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p>  <p>  Laois forms part of the Laois\/Offaly Division.  I am informed that the number of personnel assigned to that Division on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 294 members, 22 Garda Reserves and 22 civilians.  I am further informed that the personnel assigned to the Kildare Division was 307 members, 22 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.

However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300062#WRE01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300062#WRE01450"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[40034\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300062#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if leave to remain will be facilitated in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":269,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that this person originally arrived in the State on 23 December 2008 and registered as a student on 7 January 2009 and that their permission expired on 31 March 2015.<\/p>  <p>  An application was received in this Department on 12 March 2015 and on 17 May 2016, this person was informed that their application was refused.  <\/p>  <p>  If this person chooses to leave the State voluntarily, then it would then be open to them to apply for a D reside visa from outside the State.

sets out the number of Garda members assigned to Divisional Drugs Units as of 31 December for the years in question, and as of 31 October, in the case of this year.  <\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that there has been some restructuring of Garda Divisions within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the time period requested and that this is reflected in the tables.<table><tr><th

The relief is available, subject to a maximum limit, where farm land is leased to a qualifying lessee for a period of 5 years or more. In order to qualify\u00a0for the purpose of the relief, the lessee must not be connected with the lessor or with any of the lessors if there is more than one.  The rules for establishing whether or not persons are connected are laid down by section 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Effectively this means that a lessor is not entitled to relief where the land is let to family members or family members of their spouse or civil partner.<\/p>  <p>  The restriction on the availability of the relief in relation to leases to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be potentially open to abuse, for example with\u00a0the\u00a0passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed.

In Section 52 of the Bill, I have provided for an amendment to section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, the section that provides an exemption from capital acquisitions tax on the inheritance or gift of a dwelling house in certain circumstances.  I consider that this particular relief has lost focus since its introduction because of changes made to how it operates over the years.  The purpose of my amendment is to realign the exemption with its original policy objective i.e. to alleviate the hardship of an inheritance tax liability for a person who inherited a house in which he or she had been living with the deceased and to ensure that the person did not have to sell the house to pay the tax liability.  The changes I have proposed will have two principal effects.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the dwelling house exemption will only be available for inheritances.  With one exception, it will no longer be possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception will be where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person's principal private residence at the date of his or her death.  This requirement will be relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in a nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  If my amendment is accepted by the Oireachtas and enacted in the Finance Bill, it will take effect from the date of enactment.  There will not be any provision for transitional arrangements for those people who may have already acquired a dwelling house for another person to live in with the intention of making a gift of the house to that person when the required three-year period of occupation comes to an end.  As the provision was intended to alleviate hardship it is not my intention to delay the introduction of the new arrangements to facilitate individuals who intended to make use of the previous arrangements to avoid tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF03200"},{"type":"question","counter":348,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[39584\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has used any private unsecured e-mail accounts for official business; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy,\u00a0I wish to advise that I do not use any private unsecured email accounts for official business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF03500"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[39635\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if dividend withholding tax, DWT, is exempted\u00a0under tax legislation, Revenue Commissioners guidance and the Ireland-Malta double tax treaty, in the circumstances in which the recipient of the dividend, shareholder 29.9%, is a Maltese tax resident shareholder with a 29.9% shareholding in the Irish resident company that is quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[39636\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if DWT is exempted\u00a0under tax legislation and Revenue Commissioners guidance\u00a0in the circumstances in which the recipient of the dividend, shareholder 15%, is an Irish investment fund that is regulated by the Central Bank with a 15% shareholding in the Irish resident company that is quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[39637\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if DWT is exempted under tax legislation\u00a0and Revenue Commissioners guidance\u00a0in the circumstances in which the recipient of the dividend, shareholder 15%, is an Irish limited company with a 15% shareholding in the Irish resident company that is quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":354,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 to 164, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT)\u00a0is to collect tax at source from dividend payments and other distributions made by Irish resident companies to Irish resident individuals who are chargeable to income tax on such distributions (with a credit allowed for DWT deducted).<\/p>  <p>  The legislation dealing with DWT, which is contained in Chapter 8A of Part 6 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, provides for a number of exemptions from the requirement to operate DWT.  These statutory exemptions apply where the recipient of a dividend from an Irish resident company would not be subject to Irish tax in respect of that income.  In those cases, if exemptions from DWT were not available, any DWT deducted would have to be refunded.  Deducting DWT in cases where there is no liability to Irish tax on the dividend income would result in an unnecessary burden for the recipient of the dividend, with no net additional yield to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  A dividend paid by an Irish resident company to another Irish resident company is not subject to corporation tax in the hands of the recipient company on the basis that the profits from which the dividend is paid will already have been subject to corporation tax in the hands of the paying company.  Therefore, Irish tax legislation does not require DWT to be applied in respect of dividends paid by one Irish resident company to another.  In circumstances where the paying company is not a '51% subsidiary' of the company in receipt of the dividend, the exemption from DWT is not automatic and must be established by means of an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption completed by the applicant company.<\/p>  <p>  DWT also does not apply where a dividend is paid by an Irish resident company to a shareholder that is a collective investment undertaking such as an investment fund regulated by the Central Bank.  In order for the exemption to apply the collective investment undertaking must make an appropriate declaration of entitlement to the exemption.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Certain non-resident persons, who are not chargeable to tax in respect of the dividend income concerned, are also specifically exempted from DWT under the legislation.  An individual shareholder who is resident in a country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty, such as Malta, and who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the State, is exempt from income tax, under Irish tax legislation, in respect of dividends received from an Irish resident company.  Similarly, the individual would also be exempt from DWT in respect of such dividends provided he or she makes an appropriate declaration confirming entitlement to the exemption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tracker Mortgage Data","counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF04000"},{"type":"question","counter":356,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[39726\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to his written request to the Governor of the Central Bank on 9 July 2015 to provide him with information in respect of the number of mortgages that were switched from a tracker to a variable rate since 2008 to date, if he will now confirm this figure or provide the reason for this information not being available as per his written request; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":357,"content":"<p>I note that the Deputy previously raised this matter in a Topical Issues Debate in\u00a0July 2015 and subsequently\u00a0in Parliamentary Question 34323\/15 in October 2015.

For example, the vast majority of non-resident entertainers do not file an Irish tax return and there is therefore no effective mechanism to quantify the potential tax exposure of such entertainers on the income related to their Irish performances and to collect any tax owing.  Similarly, an alternative system which would impose an obligation on paying agents to deduct tax from payments made to foreign entertainers and account for the tax to Revenue, would also present many difficulties such as the requirement to identify the paying agent, in order to enforce collection, as well as placing a costly compliance burden, both on Revenue and the non-resident artistes and paying agents.  Imposing tax therefore would be administratively cumbersome relative to the potentially small prospective yield and would also undoubtedly discourage some artistes from performing in the State.<\/p>  <p>  I can however advise the Deputy that in general where a concert takes place in Ireland, the artists performance fee is subject to Irish VAT.  Where an international performer is engaged by a promoter, it is the responsibility of the promoter to account for the VAT due on the performance fee.  This means that where the promoter is established in Ireland, the promoter is required to account for Irish VAT on the performance fee. In circumstances where the artist and promoter are both established outside the State, the promoter is required to account for VAT on the performance fee where she\/he is established.<\/p>  <p>  Where a premises provider allows a promoter who is not established in the State to hold a concert on their premises, the provider must report details of the event to Revenue.  Failure to do so can make the premises provider jointly liable for any VAT arising.  This is a safeguard provision to ensure the correct VAT is collected and paid in relation to any merchandise sold at the concert venue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Portfolio","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF04600"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[39744\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF04700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will direct NAMA to engage with the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group that have been seeking a meeting regarding the potential for building significant quantities of social and affordable housing on that site, which they own; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>It is important to stress that NAMA\u00a0 is not a property developer and does not own the site to which\u00a0the Deputy refers.  Rather, NAMA's role is\u00a0that of a secured lender to the\u00a0property owner.  As a secured lender, NAMA may\u00a0provide funding to its debtors and receivers where it is shown that this will increase the overall recovery for NAMA from the security being funded.  Such funding is entirely consistent with NAMA's mandate to secure maximum return to the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p>NAMA was established as a commercially independent body mandated to achieve\u00a0its Purposes under the\u00a0NAMA\u00a0Act.  Chapter 2 of the NAMA Act provides for the establishment of the NAMA Board\u00a0whose functions are to operate NAMA in accordance with the Act, and to oversee the commercial operation of NAMA.  Under Section 14 of the NAMA Act, the\u00a0Minister may issue directions concerning the achievement of the Purposes of the Act as set out in Section 2 of the Act.  The Deputy will note that all previous Directions issued to NAMA have been technical in nature and did not relate to individual assets nor NAMA's commercial decisions.  The list of directions is available from the NAMA website: .<\/p><p>The NAMA Act bars\u00a0political interference for good reason.  There is no role for political interference with\u00a0the commercial decisions of NAMA, such as any proposed funding\u00a0strategy for the site the Deputy references.  From the outset, the Oireachtas worked to ensure NAMA would be independent in its decision-making to avoid a position where others, whether for political or commercial self-interest or for other reasons, would seek to influence decision-making in a way that would serve vested interests.<\/p><p>As such, issuing a direction to NAMA is not a measure that I take lightly.  I have no reason to believe\u00a0that NAMA is not\u00a0operating within its mandate\u00a0and progressing its objectives, as required by the NAMA\u00a0Act in\u00a0achieving the Purposes of the Act.  Therefore, I do not propose to issue a direction, regarding the achievement of the purposes of the\u00a0Act, at this time.<\/p><p>Perhaps more importantly for the Deputy's question,\u00a0Dublin City Council is specified as the Development Agency for the purposes of the Planning Scheme under the Poolbeg West\u00a0Strategic Development Zone designation in accordance with Part IX Section 166(3) of the Planning\u00a0and Development\u00a0Act 2000 and accordingly intends to prepare a Planning Scheme.<\/p><p>I am informed by Dublin City Council\u00a0that as part of its\u00a0initial research, Dublin City Council has undertaken\u00a0a consultation process in relation to this scheme.  This non-statutory phase has helped to inform the process, ensuring that all relevant considerations are taken into account in the preparation of a Draft Planning Scheme.  On 5 July 2016 a newspaper notice prepared by Dublin City Council was published in the Irish Times to advertise the consultation period.  It invited interested individuals and bodies to submit ideas or comments on matters relevant to the preparation of the Draft Planning Scheme.  The deadline for submissions was 4 August 2016.  It was also emphasised that all comments\/submissions would become a matter for public record and would be taken into account\u00a0 in preparing the scheme.  To coincide with the consultation period, a series of public information sessions was organised in the local area\u00a0during July.<\/p><p>The consultation sessions provided an opportunity for members of the public to discuss aspects of the SDZ with Dublin City Council\u00a0staff.  I understand that these\u00a0sessions were well attended and those in attendance raised a broad range of issues and concerns which related not only to the area within the SDZ boundary, but also to the surrounding areas.  In addition to these sessions, representatives of groups who wished to discuss the content of a submission made could arrange to meet a member of the planning team.  These meetings were then held during the week of the\u00a08th-12th of August.<\/p><p>The Council's SDZ planning team is now preparing a report on\u00a0the consultation process and the content of\u00a0all submissions received. In parallel, research work is continuing and this includes consultation with relevant statutory bodies.  These research processes, along with the development parameters defined in the Government Order and Draft City Development Plan 2017-2022 will inform the early development Draft Planning Scheme through the analysis stage, to the development of a concept plan(s) for the site.<\/p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Dublin City Council\u00a0website ()\u00a0on how this process is proceeding along with details of further public consultation.  Once the Draft planning scheme is complete a statutory public display period will take place and this will last for\u00a06 weeks during which time\u00a0submissions will again be invited.  I would suggest that the\u00a0Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group actively participate in the consultation phases of this\u00a0planning process.<\/p><p>Separately, I have\u00a0consistently\u00a0explained that NAMA cannot subvent the supply of social housing.  Section 10 of the NAMA Act requires NAMA to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for taxpayers.  In line with NAMA's obligations under Section 10, all residential projects, including any\u00a0which may be envisaged for the Glass Bottle site,\u00a0will be required to pass a stringent commercial viability threshold before NAMA approves funding and funding\u00a0will\u00a0only be made available if it is expected to\u00a0increase the overall recovery for NAMA\u00a0from the security being funded.  NAMA\u00a0is obliged to act\u00a0akin to a private sector commercial entity.<\/p><p>With NAMA estimating that 20,000\u00a0residential units\u00a0may be delivered under its Residential Funding Programme between 2016 and 2020, the corresponding Part V contribution\u00a0of\u00a02,000 social housing units\u00a0should not be forgotten.  As with any delivery of housing, the\u00a0Part V contribution is a meaningful contribution to social housing supply.  However, for the reasons outlined above, it is not appropriate to\u00a0direct or dictate a particular strategy\u00a0to\u00a0NAMA.  The Agency\u00a0cannot\u00a0fund the development of residential\u00a0units, private or social,\u00a0on anything other than commercial terms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF04900"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[39778\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300063#WRF05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons assessed for tax on foreign social security pensions for each of the tax years 2010 to 2015; and the number of persons assessed for tax on foreign occupational pensions for each of the tax years 2010 to 2015.","asker":"1222","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that on the basis of income tax returns filed, the following table sets out those income earners that have been assessed to tax on Foreign State Pensions or Foreign Other Pension.

The exact allocation of taxing rights is a matter for negotiation between the Governments of the two countries concerned and a treaty will only be agreed if both countries are satisfied with the outcome.<\/p>  <p>  As an OECD member country, Ireland's treaties are typically based on the OECD Model Treaty.

The Apple case concerns two advance opinions issued by Revenue in 1991 and 2007.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has published detailed guidelines on the provision of tax opinions which are available on Revenue's website at www.Revenue.ie.  While it is open to any taxpayer to seek an opinion from Revenue on the tax treatment of a particular transaction or activity, the circumstances in which a taxpayer should require an opinion from Revenue are relatively limited.  This is because Revenue already publishes extensive detailed information on the application of tax legislation in various tax briefings and guidelines which are available on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  An opinion will be provided by Revenue where the issues are complex, information is not readily available or there is genuine uncertainty in relation to the applicable tax rules as set down in the legislation.

Taxpayers can seek such an agreement where they want certainty\u00a0that they are correctly applying transfer pricing rules.  One of the recommendations from the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project was that countries should implement bilateral APA programmes to provide greater certainty in relation to the taxation of cross-border transactions.

I would clarify that while Revenue may issue non-binding advisory opinions in certain circumstances and may make determinations in respect of certain VAT matters, Revenue does not issue &quot;letters of comfort&quot;.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been a focus on tax opinions, or 'rulings' as they are sometimes called, over the last number of years, in particular as a result of the European Commission State aid investigations in a number of countries.  Ireland does not have a statutory system of binding tax 'rulings' and there is no provision in Irish law for the issuing of such rulings.<\/p><p>Revenue may provide non-binding opinions on the application of tax law to specific transactions or situations.  The provision of such opinions comes within the general administrative functions vested in Revenue under tax legislation.  While it is open to any taxpayer to seek an opinion from Revenue on the tax treatment of a particular transaction or activity, the circumstances in which a taxpayer should require an opinion from Revenue are relatively limited.  This is because Revenue already publishes extensive detailed information, on the application of tax legislation, in various tax briefings and guidelines which are available on the Revenue website.  Revenue has published detailed guidelines on the provision of tax opinions, which are also\u00a0available on the Revenue website.  Guidelines relating to opinions for cases dealt with by Revenue's Large Cases Division (LCD) are available on <i>www.revenue.ie<\/i>under &quot;[37.0.40] Large Cases Division: Opinions\/Confirmations on Tax\/Duty Consequences of a Proposed Course of Action&quot;.

In no case has Revenue the authority or discretion to depart from the applicable rules as set out in tax law. <\/p><p>In addition to providing opinions, Revenue may make determinations on certain VAT matters such as the appropriate rate of VAT that applies to a particular supply of goods or services or on whether a particular activity is exempt from VAT.  Information on the circumstances in which such determinations are made and the process is available at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Statistics have not been compiled on the number of tax opinions issued by Revenue and determinations made by Revenue in relation to certain VAT matters each year.  However, in responding to the European Commission enquiries in relation to tax ruling practice in the various Member States, Revenue identified that, in the period 2010 to 2012, the total number of opinions issued to companies on various matters relating to corporation tax was as follows: <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>99<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>128<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>108<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>To facilitate accountability Revenue has committed to publishing in its future Annual Reports the number of opinions it issues each year.

Previously the maximum period was seven years.  However, depending on the particular circumstances, a shorter period than five years may be specified.  After the maximum validity period, whether five years or less, an application for a renewal or extension must be made if the taxpayer wishes for the opinion to continue.  It has always been the case that an opinion will only remain valid for so long as the facts and circumstances on which it is based continue to exist and the relevant legislation and practice remains in place.<\/p><p>Revenue has also confirmed that it has begun reviewing a number of opinions that were provided more than five years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300064#WRG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Data","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300064#WRG01050"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[40048\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300064#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the results of the consultation process into the impact of bogus self employment arrangements will be published; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":401,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that earlier this year, she as Minister for Social Protection and I as Minister for Finance launched a consultation process on the use of intermediary-type employment structures and self-employment arrangements, and their impact on tax and PRSI.

In Section 52 of the Bill, I have provided for an amendment to section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, the section that provides an exemption from capital acquisitions tax on the inheritance or gift of a dwelling house in certain circumstances.  I consider that this particular relief has lost focus since its introduction because of changes made to how it operates over the years.  The purpose of my amendment is to realign the exemption with its original policy objective i.e. to alleviate the hardship of an inheritance tax liability for a person who inherited a house in which he or she had been living with the deceased and to ensure that the person did not have to sell the house to pay the tax liability.  The changes I have proposed will have two principal effects. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the dwelling house exemption will only be available for inheritances.  With one exception, it will no longer be possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception will be where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person's principal private residence at the date of his or her death.  This requirement will be relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in a nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  If my amendment is accepted by the Oireachtas and enacted in the Finance Bill, it will take effect from the date of enactment.  There will not be any provision for transitional arrangements for those people who may have already acquired a dwelling house for another person to live in with the intention of making a gift of the house to that person when the required three-year period of occupation comes to an end.  As the provision was intended to alleviate hardship it is not my intention to delay the introduction of the new arrangements to facilitate individuals who intended to make use of the previous arrangements to avoid tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300064#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300064#WRG01650"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[40052\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300064#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the unemployment benefits paid to former staff of the EU institutions under article 29(a) staff regulations of officials of the European Communities are subjected to PRSI and USC in view of the fact they are on unemployment benefit which is normally exempted when paid by the State; if those persons in receipt of this EU unemployment benefit can avail of the PAYE tax credit on a par with those in receipt of Irish unemployment benefits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1308","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>Following clarification with\u00a0the Deputy's Office, it is understood that his question\u00a0refers to article 28(a) of Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities.

Overall, between the Land Aggregation Scheme sites and Local Authority lands approximately 700 sites in total have been identified, which are referenced on page 50 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>, in the context of the potential for mixed-tenure development on State-owned and other lands.

I intend to make an initial announcement on progress on the assessment of the proposals before the end of the year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300066#WRJ06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300066#WRJ06500"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[39743\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300066#WRJ06600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will meet with representatives from the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group that have been seeking a meeting with him regarding the potential for building significant quantities of social and affordable housing on that site; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1281","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":587,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[39771\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300066#WRJ06700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to meet with representatives of the Ringsend Glass Bottle Site Housing Action Group (details supplied) to discuss their plans for the old glass bottle site portion of the SDZ in Ringsend, Dublin; and if he will consider their proposals for maximising the provision of social and affordable housing in that location.","asker":"1215","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":588,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together. <\/p>  <p>  The Poolbeg West Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) site has significant potential to deliver additional housing supply, including for social housing purposes, at a pace and scale that will greatly assist in addressing the current critical shortage of housing supply in the Dublin Region. <\/p>  <p>  The Government Order, designating the Poolbeg West area as a Strategic Development Zone, with Dublin City Council as the relevant development agency , pursuant to the provisions of Section 166 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended),   provides for, inter alia, the provision of social and affordable housing. <\/p>  <p>  As is required under the SDZ process, a Planning Scheme must now be prepared and adopted by Dublin City Council for the planned development of these lands, including providing in excess of 2,000 &ndash; 2,500 new homes, which will include social and affordable housing, as well as supporting social, educational and recreational infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  As this process is about to be undertaken by Dublin City Council with full statutory consultation with the local community and other stakeholders, and having regard to the provisions of Section 30 of the Planning Act, which prevent the Minister from becoming involved in individual planning cases, it would not be appropriate at this stage of the process for me to engage with stakeholders outside of my statutory role in formally commenting on the draft Planning Scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I expect the site to provide for the delivery of residential and appropriate commercial development, with supporting infrastructure and facilities, in a timely, sustainable and co-ordinated manner.

The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion nor do I propose to review the scheme in this regard.<\/p><p>Given that the scheme does not apply to dwellings which have a Damage Condition Rating of 1, the Pyrite Resolution Board does not maintain records on the number of properties that fall into this category.  Nevertheless, the Board is aware that 10 dwellings, which had a Damage Condition Rating of 1 when their building condition assessments were first completed, and which were refused under the scheme, have now progressed to a Damage Condition Rating of 2; these dwellings have now been included in the pyrite remediation scheme following the submission of new applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300067#WRK03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Resolution Board Data","counter":627,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300067#WRK03900"},{"type":"question","counter":628,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[40108\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300067#WRK04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of pyrite damaged houses in County Meath that have applications for remediation under the pyrite remediation scheme; and the number that have been remediated.","asker":"1225","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":629,"content":"<p>The latest figures available from the Pyrite Resolution Board indicate that 1,458 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme, of which 1,077 have been approved for inclusion in the scheme as follows:<\/p><p>-  275 are at remedial works planning stage,<\/p><p>-  44 are at tender \/ tender analysis,<\/p><p>-  35 are at tender decision,<\/p><p>-  211 are under remediation, and<\/p><p>-  512 are complete.<\/p><p>Specifically, having regard to the area of Meath County Council,  the latest figures available from the Board indicate that 379 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme from homeowners, of which 180 have been completed and a further 19 are under remediation.<\/p><p>Ultimately, the Board, together with the Housing Agency, will arrange for all eligible dwellings to be remediated to a high standard and at no additional cost to the affected homeowners.

As the nature of our business changes, the organisation must adapt and structure itself in the most efficient way for effective service delivery.  Functions move between locations in the Department to deal with business efficiencies.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of elements of the Communications and Customer Services functions are being brought together within a new unit in Dublin.  One of the consequences of this reorganisation is that over the coming months 25 staff in the information section Sligo will transition to other important roles in the area. Government approval is not required for such internal reorganisations.<\/p>  <p>  Sligo is a key location for Departments Services with 654 staff located there.  The Department's office in College Road in Sligo administers national schemes including State and other Pensions, Household Benefits, the School Meals Programme and Supplementary Welfare Allowance Policy.  Since 2013 the Department's office in College Road has taken on all of the following additional functions - administering the deduction at source facility from welfare benefits for Local Property Tax, payments to the women under the Magdalen Commission Scheme and the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA).  The administration of the BSCFA in Sligo, since 2015, involves the recruitment of some 50 staff, mainly local, for a period of up to 6 months.  More recently payment of the Water Conservation Grant was administered from the Sligo Offices.  The Department also has an Intreo Centre in Sligo, located at Cranmore Road.<\/p>  <p>   The change to Information section location is in no way a diminution in the Department&rsquo;s regional office structure; 65% of the Department&rsquo;s 6,300 staff are located outside of Dublin.  Sligo was among the first locations within the Department selected for decentralisation, with 450 posts earmarked to decentralise to Sligo in 1989.  A further seven successful decentralisation initiatives have followed, with staff and schemes areas administered from Letterkenny, Buncrana, Roscommon, Longford, Dundalk and Waterford.<\/p>  <p>  Within the Department, the movement of staff between roles is ongoing and actively managed to allow the Department respond to changing demands while promoting staff development and better succession planning. Such moves, including the movement of staff from Information Section to other business areas, are supported where necessary by the provision of training and other supports.  Other than such costs, the staff changes mentioned will incur no additional cost to the Exchequer.  The transfer of staff between locations, whether by way of internal or external transfer lists or redeployment will continue to take place in accordance with all relevant agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300067#WRK07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":662,"content":"<p>Question No. 271 answered with Question No. 270.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300068#WRL00450"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[39388\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300068#WRL00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a disability allowance in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":665,"content":"<p>I confirm that my Department received an application for disability allowance from this man on 12 October 2016.

While communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen, participants also have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.  Since it was introduced in 2004, community groups have benefitted from the many projects undertaken through the scheme with minimal cost to the Exchequer.  It has also played an important role in sustaining rural communities.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the social welfare budget package for 2017, I announced an increase of &euro;5 a week in the personal rate of payment for RSS participants from March 2017.  I also announced an additional 500 places on the scheme to be rolled out in 2017 which will increase the overall number to 3,100.  My Department intends allocating these places as early as possible in 2017, taking into account a number of factors.  These include the number of places already allocated, the demand for places in particular areas, work opportunities available and the numbers of farmers and fishermen and women in receipt of income support.  In allocating the additional places, the Government recognises the valuable contribution the RSS is making to the provision of services to communities across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Eligibility for participation on the scheme will continue to be limited to those in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments and all participants must be also actively engaged in farming or fishing.  In future, all new entrants to the RSS will have to be over 25 years of age.  I believe this is appropriate as it will give younger people an opportunity to explore other training or education options before entering a long-term work programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a 6 year overall participation limit will be introduced on the scheme.  This will ensure that there will be a throughput of places available.  In this context, the Deputy should note that almost 50% of the current participants have been on the RSS for over 10 years so opportunities for new people to go on the scheme are limited.  It should also be remembered that income support will still be available to eligible farmers and fishermen in the form of Farm or Fish Assist. <\/p>  <p>  Existing RSS participants will remain on the scheme as long as they continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions of the scheme.  The new conditions outlined above will only apply to new RSS entrants.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300068#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300068#WRL01650"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[39429\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300068#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of a disability allowance application in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>The application for disability allowance, based upon the evidence submitted, was refused on medical grounds and this lady was notified in writing of this decision on 11 July 2016.

While the Pensions Act provides a framework for the regulation and supervision of occupational pension schemes, it does not impose any requirement on an employer to fund scheme benefits or maintain an existing scheme. <\/p><p>These matters have been considered many times during comprehensive reviews of the pensions system in Ireland.  The introduction of a debt on employer would raise a range of issues and possible consequences for defined benefit schemes, some of which may not be beneficial for members.  <\/p><p>It is not clear whether a change in the law could be applied to existing Schemes as well as new ones and it is not clear that any change in the law could apply to deficits already accrued as opposed to future ones.<\/p><p>There are strong arguments both for and against the introduction of an employer obligation.  While such an obligation may seem to provide stability and certainty for scheme members it may result in less desirable outcomes such as:<\/p><p>- prompting well-funded schemes to wind up to avoid the new obligations being imposed thus making the change in the law counterproductive;<\/p><p>- threatening the company's financial stability and in some circumstances rendering employers insolvent thus resulting in the loss of job or a diminution in pay, terms and conditions of employees;<\/p><p>- impacting on the company's creditors, including debts owed to other businesses, SMEs, and\/or individuals impacting on the company's shareholders and share values, many of which may be held by other pension funds, credit unions or small scale investors;<\/p><p>- impacting on company debt, investment and growth and the employers' ability to raise funds, to expand or create new employment;<\/p><p>- giving a competitive advantage to employers who never provided a pension and those with 'risk-free' defined contribution schemes.<\/p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that the issues in relation to defined benefit schemes are continuously scrutinised by the Department, especially in the present environment.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300070#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Cases","counter":802,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300070#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":803,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[39873\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300070#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if his Department has been involved in any court proceedings that involved non-disclosure agreements in the past five years; and if so, if the specific court ruling prevented knowledge of the court proceeding from being made known and knowledge of the participants to the court proceedings from being made known for each of these agreements.","asker":"1235","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":804,"content":"<p>My Department is examining the relevant records to assess the feasibility of providing the Deputy with all of the information requested.

JobPath aims to place people into full-time sustainable employment.  The period of engagement with the service for any individual is typically 52 weeks.  During that time they receive intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment and if a person is placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to an additional twelve months while in employment. <\/p>  <p>  Some 62,000 jobseekers have engaged with the service to date.  The JobPath service was rolled out on a phased basis from mid-2015.

Following an evaluation of the pilot, an Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is working towards this aim. <\/p><p>While the pilot scheme was targeted towards social welfare customers with access to the Household Budgeting facility operated by An Post, the scheme has now also been extended to social welfare recipients who receive their payment electronically into accounts in financial institutions, provided the loan repayments are made by direct debit or standing order to the credit union.  <\/p><p>Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the Personal Micro Credit Scheme through efforts to recruit Credit Unions to participate in the scheme.<\/p><p>Accordingly, 94 Credit Unions have signed up to participate in the scheme, resulting in the availability of the <i>It Makes Sense <\/i>loan in over 170 local Credit Union offices.  Not all of the 94 are currently offering the loan.  Seventeen (17) Credit Unions have decided not to offer loans under the scheme until the New Year for a number of reasons, including mergers, training requirements and internal resource constraints.  A small number (4) have placed a limit on the number of loans available under the Scheme due to the high level of demand and the additional administrative work associated with setting up payment through the Household Budgeting facility.  In addition, in order for Credit Unions to be guaranteed payments coming through the Household Budgeting facility, applications had to be submitted by 12 December to allow for the timely transfer of loan repayment from An Post to the relevant Credit Union.<\/p><p>Each Credit Union is an independent entity and the approach taken to implementation of the scheme is a matter for each Credit Union Board, at local level.  Credit Unions which have signed up to participate are committed to making the PMC scheme a success, building on the experience of the pilot and working towards broadening the reach of the scheme.  However, as Credit Unions are bearing all of the risk, a cautious approach is being taken, in order to ensure that the scheme is sustainable in the longer term.<\/p><p>The list of participating Credit Unions is updated regularly on the website for the <i>It Makes Sense<\/i>loan scheme at <i>www.itmakessenseloan.ie\/participating-credit-unions<\/i>and on the <i>It Makes Sense<\/i>Facebook page.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.

The purpose of this framework is to ensure Departments&rsquo; compliance with EU procurement rules and to ensure value for money by having a competitive process for photographic assignments.

This typically involves the following activities: <\/p><p>Convening national and regional information workshops;<\/p><p>Managing and administering the application process;<\/p><p>Organising the judging process<\/p><p>Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;<\/p><p>Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;<\/p><p>Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  <\/p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund.  This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  <\/p><p>Following a competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin.  This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website.  This public awareness work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.<\/p><p>Africa Day Family Days were hosted by the Department in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010, in CHQ in Georges Dock in 2012 and at the Farmleigh Estate annually since 2013. In 2011, the Department supported a series of smaller-scale performances, family events, art exhibitions, debates and educational activities instead of hosting a flagship event. <\/p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below.  This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.<\/p><p>DHR also provided short-term management support services for the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, including the logistical management of the nationwide public consultation activities.<\/p><p>The table below sets out the payments for project and event management since 2011.  <\/p><p><b>Payments for Project and Event Management 2011 to 2016<\/b><table><tr><th>Name of Project\/Event<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016 (to date)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DHR Communications: SCMF<\/td><td>&euro;73,237<\/td><td>&euro;47,430<\/td><td>&euro;73,836<\/td><td>&euro;60,338<\/td><td>&euro;83,757<\/td><td>&euro;131,344<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DHR Communications: White Paper Review<\/td><td>&euro;25,000<\/td><td>&euro;26,026<\/td><td>Nil<\/td><td>Nil<\/td><td>Nil<\/td><td>Nil<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DHR Communications: Africa Day<\/td><td>&euro;6,806<\/td><td>&euro;90,851<\/td><td>&euro;118,644<\/td><td>&euro;143,829<\/td><td>&euro;179,221<\/td><td>&euro;206,126<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>&euro;105,043<\/td><td>&euro;164,307<\/td><td>&euro;192,480<\/td><td>&euro;204,167<\/td><td>&euro;262,978<\/td><td>&euro;337,470<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":879,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO02000"},{"type":"question","counter":880,"qnumday":352,"qnumall":"[39585\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has used any private unsecured email accounts for official business; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":881,"content":"<p>I have not used any private unsecured email accounts for official business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":882,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO02300"},{"type":"question","counter":883,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[39639\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the increase in the assassination of human rights defenders, HRDs, in Colombia and regarding ongoing threats and intimidation against them (details supplied); and if he will call on the Colombian government to immediately implement the protection mechanisms for HRDs that are enshrined in the peace accords and in national law.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":884,"content":"<p>I am aware of the reports of violence and the deaths of human rights defenders in Colombia to which the Deputy refers.

The aim is to ensure that Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.<\/p><p>A full list of observers who have served on election observation missions from 2013 to mid-November 2016, together with the costs arising, is set out in the tables below.  Those names marked with an asterix are officials from the Department, who work on relevant geographic desks, or election Focal Points who on occasion also participate in such missions.<\/p><p>The European Union covers the costs associated with EU Election Observation Missions.  For OSCE missions, the Department covers all costs incurred by the individual Irish election observers.  This includes a daily allowance based on OSCE guidance, to cover the cost of food, accommodation and local transport costs in country.  A return air fare is also provided.  In addition, all Irish election observation roster members undertaking a mission, receive a once-off grant annually of &euro;600 from the Department to cover pre-departure mission expenses.  Insurance cover is also provided by the Department for all observers.  The costs incurred by officials are paid on the same basis as other election roster members, but no pre-departure grant is provided.<\/p><p>For each election observation mission, the EU or OSCE set out their specific requirements and, on the basis of expressions of interest and application form submitted by roster members, the Department draws up a list of observers.  In selecting nominees to be put forward, the specific criteria set by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience and language proficiency, form the principal basis for decision-making.  Issues of gender balance and length of time since serving on a mission are also taken into account.  In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate observers with limited experience.  Following consideration of the applicants, a draft list of nominees is submitted for Ministerial approval.<\/p><p>For EU missions, the final selection of observers submitted by the Department rests with the European Commission.  In the case of OSCE election missions, all of the observers nominated by the Department are usually selected.  By the end of 2016, it is envisaged that 67 observers will have participated on missions this year, compared to 46 in 2015. <\/p><p><b>Election Observation Missions

to take Questions 359 to 361, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The current Election Observation Roster maintained and administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was established in May 2013 for a period of five years.  This followed a review of the previous roster and a public call for applications.  Following the independent appraisal and ranking of the 263 eligible applications, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new roster and a reserve panel of the next 10 highest scoring individuals was also established, from which replacements would be drawn should any members leave the roster during the five year period.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of members who have left the roster, and those who have been added from the reserve panel, the current roster complement stands at 198 and the reserve panel has been fully utilised.   Of this current roster, 128 members have undertaken missions since 2013 while 70 members have not yet served on a mission.  In the vast majority of cases, the reason for non-participation is that members have not yet applied to go on a mission.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of EU missions, the final selection of nominees submitted by the Department rests with the European Commission.  In the case of OSCE election missions, all of the observers nominated by the Department are usually selected.  <\/p>  <p>  Officials of the Department&rsquo;s Election Desk do take into account any feedback received from roster members, but are also mindful that the numbers of applicants for election missions are always higher than the available places. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland actively participates in the European Commission and European External Action Service - led European Observation network, which brings together election observation Focal Points from all EU Member States, together with Norway, Switzerland and Canada.   The network facilities exchange of information and international best practice on all aspects of election monitoring and roster administration and helps to ensure that Ireland is acting in accordance with best practice in the operation of the roster. <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the current roster is well equipped to deal with the requisite requirements of the EU and OSCE.  It is envisaged that the current roster will operate until May 2018, but will be kept under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":904,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO04400"},{"type":"question","counter":905,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[40110\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO04500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the conflict in Yemen; and if he will report on interaction he and his officials have had with authorities in Yemen and the region regarding the conflict.","asker":"1254","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":906,"qnumday":363,"qnumall":"[40111\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the assistance he and his officials have given to humanitarian relief in Yemen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":907,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[40112\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO04700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has discussed the conflict in Yemen with his European Union counterparts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1254","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":908,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 362 to 364, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I have been monitoring the situation in Yemen with growing concern.  Last spring, when a ceasefire was announced after over a year of fighting, it seemed like the conflict might come to an end.  However, efforts to broker peace were unsuccessful and, since August, the situation has continued to deteriorate.  <\/p>  <p>  UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team continue to try to draw the parties to the negotiating table, and I commend them for all of their efforts to date.  However, time continues to pass and it does not seem that there is an end to the conflict in sight.  Those with influence in the region need to use their sway to convince the parties to lay down weapons and negotiate in earnest. <\/p>  <p>  This war is having a devastating impact on the civilian population of the Gulf&rsquo;s poorest country.  The UN has described the humanitarian situation as &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo;.  About 80% of the population is dependent on humanitarian aid.  There are reports of a cholera epidemic, and the country is one step away from famine.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, Irish Aid provided &euro;1,850,000 in response to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.  This included &euro;1 million to the UN Humanitarian Pooled Fund in Yemen, which provides rapid, flexible funding to NGOs and UN agencies; &euro;750,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Yemen; and &euro;100,000 to Oxfam Ireland, to assist displaced people.  To date in 2016, Ireland has provided &euro;2 million to the UN Humanitarian Pooled Fund in Yemen, and &euro;100,000 to Goal.  Total Irish humanitarian response since 2015 is &euro;3,950,000.<\/p>  <p>  This conflict has also been characterised by allegations of violations of International Humanitarian Law and the Law of War by all sides.  Reports abound of airstrikes on civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and even a funeral.  I cannot comment on the intent of these attacks, but I strongly condemn the killing and injuring of innocent civilians in all circumstances.  At the Human Rights Council in September, Ireland supported calls for the establishment of an independent international investigation into the situation in Yemen.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland does not have an Embassy in Yemen, but the Ambassador to Saudi Arabia is also accredited to Yemen.  I myself recently travelled to the Gulf, where I met with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Nizar bin Obaid Madani.  While the detail of these conversations is confidential I can confirm that I expressed my concern about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen, resulting from the conflict, and about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians.  <\/p>  <p>  I have also discussed the Yemeni situation with my EU counterparts.  In November 2015, we passed Council Conclusions on the conflict, urging the parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, and to begin negotiating a peace settlement in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2216.  The humanitarian situation was also discussed several times in Brussels in 2016 at official level.  <\/p>  <p>  I encourage the parties to this conflict to lay down arms and return to the negotiating table.  As I have said before in this House, a resolution will not come through continued fighting.  The only way to end the suffering of the Yemeni people is through peace.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":909,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO04900"},{"type":"question","counter":910,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[40136\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300071#WRO05000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the name and number of Bills in preparation in his Department and published by his Department since May 2016; the Stage each Bill is at in the Houses of the Oireachtas; the number of Bills from his Department signed into law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":911,"content":"<p>No Bills prepared in my Department since May 2016 have been signed into law.<\/p>  <p>  The Protection of Cultural Property in the event of Armed Conflict (Hague Convention) Bill 2016 was presented to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 18 July.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.<\/p><p>As Minister, I draw on information provided by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, maintained by my Department, to recommend structures for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures. However, the final decision in regard to inclusion is a reserved function of the planning authority.<\/p><p>Under section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its Record of Protected Structures a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure.  Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the Record of Protected Structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it.  <\/p><p>There is a duty on owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment.  Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action.<\/p><p>The structure referred to by the Deputy is listed on both the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage and on the Record of Protected Structures.  The destruction of the house, which I understand is the subject of a Garda investigation as a criminal matter, is most regrettable. <\/p><p>My Department has issued guidance circulars previously on disaster management\/security of derelict protected structures to local authorities and follows up as appropriate in individual circumstances.  In this case, officials of my Department met with the local authority in the week following the fire to initiate discussions on all the issues arising from the loss. Correspondence was received from the organisation referred to by the Deputy in relation to the structure mentioned and a reply was issued by my Department.<\/p><p>I understand that the local authority has been acting with the relevant parties to seek to protect the building.  In 2012 and 2014, the council carried out urgent conservation works to the roof of the house with financial assistance from my Department.<\/p><p>There are a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites\/buildings deemed to be at risk.  One of these is the receipt of applications for funding for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.<\/p><p>Financial support is provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.  My Department itself operates a Structures at Risk Fund (SRF) to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts.<\/p><p>In 2015, I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) - for the repair and conservation of protected structures.  The 2016 BHIS scheme has operated via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  In 2016, BHIS has supported over 270 projects across the country, creating over 17,000 days of employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme has also leveraged just under &euro;5.5 million, more than double the scheme&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;2 million. Both schemes will run again in 2017.<\/p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2016, the Council is administering a community-based heritage grants scheme available for projects that contributed to particular heritage themes.  Further details can be found at <i>www.heritagecouncil.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>My Department will continue its ongoing support and engagement with local authorities as regards their functions for the protection and management of our built heritage as set out under the Planning and Development Acts, having regard to the available resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300073#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Urban Renewal Schemes","counter":1006,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300073#WRQ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1007,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[39753\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300073#WRQ02300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding allocations to projects under the town and village schemes by county; the total allocation to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1008,"content":"<p>Last August, I launched the Town and Village Renewal Scheme with an allocation of &euro;10 million in funding for this year.

This new national policy applies to all HSE and HSE-funded services for older people and people with disabilities.  It incorporates the previously existing HSE elder abuse service into a single structure for older people and people with disabilities.  The policy outlines the procedures to be followed when there is a concern of abuse, neglect or self-neglect of a vulnerable adult. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has established a number of structures to implement the policy, including a National Safeguarding Office and a National Safeguarding Committee.  Safeguarding and Protection Teams to deal with suspected abuse have been established in each of the nine Community Healthcare Organisation Areas.  These Teams are managed and led by a Principal Social Worker and staffed by Social Work team leaders and Professionally Qualified Social Workers.  Staff training is under way  and over 900 Designated Officers have been appointed in service settings within the HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Division to receive concerns or referrals of abuse. <\/p>  <p>  The National Safeguarding Committee was established in December 2015 with the overarching remit to support the development of a societal and organisational culture which promotes the rights of persons who may be vulnerable and safeguard them from abuse.   It is a multi-agency and inter-sectoral body with an independent chair and will publish its Strategic Plan 2017 &ndash; 2021 later this month.  This Plan includes the strategic objective of informing and influencing Government policy and legislation to safeguard the rights of people who may be vulnerable, including a focus on issues such as adult safeguarding, advocacy, the use of chemical restraint and deprivation of liberty.  Minister Harris met with the Chair of the Committee on 5 December to discuss a number of issues, including the possibility of a consultation document  on the development of legislation to include adult safeguarding.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to residents of nursing homes, all public and private nursing homes must comply with Regulations under the Health Act 2007 and with National Standards prepared by HIQA and subject to Ministerial approval.  The Regulations contain provisions in relation to the prevention, detection and response to abuse.  National Standard 3.1 specifically states that each resident must be safeguarded from abuse and neglect and their safety and welfare promoted.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering home and other community-based services for older people and people with a disability.  Homecare services are currently not formally regulated.  It is accepted that there is a need to regulate the sector and the Department has asked the Health Research Board to review how homecare services are funded and regulated in comparable jurisdictions.  The HRB review is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300074#WRR04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Coverage","counter":1085,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300074#WRR04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1086,"qnumday":428,"qnumall":"[39526\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300074#WRR04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will amend the terms of the long-term illness scheme to cater for persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1087,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal devices under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300074#WRR04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1088,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300074#WRR04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1089,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[39535\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300074#WRR04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1090,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act, 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Persons can opt to be treated privately on admission to a public hospital, in which case they are liable for the consultants fees and hospital charges arising for that episode of care, whether paid for by the patient or by a health insurer on their behalf.   <\/p>  <p>  The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 revised the charging regime in respect of private patients in public hospitals.  Previously, the cost of providing private services in public hospitals were not reflected in the charges levied on private patients, as only a &euro;75 statutory in-patient charge applied.  The private in-patient charge applicable now takes account of all the services which a public hospital provides, for example, accommodation, nursing, diagnostics (such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI etc.) and other overheads and maintenance costs.  The 2013 Act makes it clear that it is not where the private service is received that matters, but rather it is the receiving of such private services that makes patients liable for the charges and obliges the charges to be raised.   <\/p>  <p>  Regarding the broader issue of charging in respect of customers for inaccurate services, it is my understanding that health insurers issue a statement of benefit to each customer detailing the payments made by that insurer on their behalf.  If customers think that there is a mistake on their statement or that their insurer has been charged for  treatments not received, they can notify the insurer accordingly.  The insurer can then examine the individual case, on behalf of their customers, to ensure the claim details are accurate.  In this way, incidences of error or overcharging by healthcare providers can be identified, fully investigated and rectified as appropriate. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300075#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":1153,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300075#WRS02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1154,"qnumday":451,"qnumall":"[39720\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300075#WRS02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the case of a person (details supplied) who is waiting to receive HSE equipment;

This is in line with the recommendations of the HIQA unannounced inspection reports at the Hospital on 28 November 2014 and 13 January 2015.<\/p><p>This includes:<\/p><p>-  An intensive screening programme for the detection of Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae, CRE among high risk patients;<\/p><p>-  An isolation ward for the mitigation of any risk of cross-transmission of newly detected or known positive patients;<\/p><p>-  Adoption of strict contact precautions, dedicated equipment and a highly intensive cleaning regimen;<\/p><p>-  Speedy laboratory procedures to ensure results regarding infections available within 24 hours;<\/p><p>-  Good communication amongst microbiologists and with all relevant parties on detection of a new case.<\/p><p>-  Good communication with patients and GPs and other health care worker contacts to inform GPs of their patients&rsquo; status.<\/p><p>A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years to tackle healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance, covering improved surveillance of infections and prescribing and infection prevention and control processes.<\/p><p>It also includes antimicrobial stewardship initiatives, public and professional awareness-raising with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.<\/p><p>Ireland is also developing a National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance in line with the World Health Organisation's 2015 Global Action Plan on AMR and the European Council&rsquo;s 2016 Conclusions : 'The next steps under a <i>'One Health'<\/i>approach to combat antimicrobial resistance'.<\/p><p>The National Action Plan is being developed with the oversight and guidance of the Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee.  The Committee was established in 2014 by my Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in recognition of the need for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to tackling the issue of AMR.  This inter-sectoral approach crosses the health, veterinary and environmental spheres to encompass all stakeholders&rsquo; efforts to address what is a world-wide concern.  It is intended that the National Action Plan will be published in 2017.<\/p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) is Ireland's specialist agency for the surveillance of communicable diseases and is part of the Health Service Executive. HPSC works in partnership with health service providers and sister organisations in Ireland and around the world and collates, interprets and disseminates data and information on communicable diseases.<\/p><p>Tackling AMR will require the whole system to prioritise key initiatives, working with our international colleagues. Ireland is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at international, EU and national levels to this end. <\/p><p>Nationally, I expect that the HSE will place particular emphasis on prevention and management of healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in its service planning for 2017.<\/p><p>Protected disclosures received by the Minister for Health are managed in accordance with the requirements under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on such matters.<\/p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s detailed queries in relation to the publication of an HPSC report into infection control at UHL, deaths due to infection at the hospital relative to deaths at other major hospitals, and regarding staff turnover are operational issues and have, therefore, been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300078#WRV03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1367,"content":"<p>Question No. 530 answered with Question No. 469.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Payment Scheme Coverage","counter":1368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300078#WRV04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1369,"qnumday":531,"qnumall":"[40100\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300078#WRV04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to make a certain device (details supplied) available under the general medical card scheme;

This sector is a very important area in the agricultural economy but it has been a challenging year both in terms of market returns and variable weather conditions experienced during the harvest.<\/p>  <p>  While there is no specific funding available for losses due to poor weather conditions I wish to confirm that at Agriculture Council I have repeatedly called for the situation on agricultural markets to be kept under ongoing review, and have said that we should be ready to deploy support measures if the circumstances require it. At the October Council Minister of State Doyle followed this up with a specific request that market support efforts be extended to the cereals sector.<\/p>  <p>  However, I know the Deputy will be aware that I recently chaired a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector.  As I said at the time and I wish to repeat here, again this meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.<\/p>  <p>  At that meeting and in direct response to the difficulties being experienced, I outlined that one of my chief priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day, my plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme. This has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25 m from my Department, to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000. The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU&rsquo;s agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements.<\/p>  <p>  This is a cash flow support facility, to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture SMEs. The loans will be unsecured and are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts. I recently welcomed the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme.  The SBCI is targeting that the loans will be available in the market by the end of January 2017. I am encouraging farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now and, if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.<\/p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments. Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year. This will be available immediately, for this year&rsquo;s tax liability, and this will go some way towards addressing current cash flow concerns.<\/p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made this year in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes. Advance payments commenced on the 17th October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations, with the addition of balancing payments from the 1st December.<\/p>  <p>  To date &euro;1,141 billion has been paid out to 121,508 farmers and payments are ongoing. I was also pleased to note that the processing of the Areas of Natural Constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected that approx 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.  My Department will also be opening a measure under the TAMS Scheme specifically for the Tillage Sector.<\/p>  <p>  I also stressed at the recent Tillage stakeholders meeting and I want to restate my view that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300079#WRW01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300079#WRW01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1395,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[39463\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300079#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to set out in tabular form the total photography costs for his Department per annum since March 2011 inclusive of costs incurred from use of the ministerial allowance; the occasions for which photographers were booked; the photographers used; the breakdown of costs associated with each occasion that a photographer was used; if there is a policy regarding the booking of photographers within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1396,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is available on my Departments website at www.agriculture.gov.ie\/aboutus\/ministers\/photographycosts.

ComReg monitors compliance in this regard by means of biannual drive tests.  I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.\u00a0 Any customer, including those in County Kerry, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance. If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services. The Terms of Reference of the Taskforce state that it will identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken to improve mobile reception and broadband access. The Taskforce has already met approximately twenty times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement. <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecoms operators. I anticipate that we will bring a report later this month, on foot of its work. This report will set out specific\u00a0timelines for the delivery of the recommendations and actions, including a key role for Local Authorities in supporting the rollout of telecoms infrastructure. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys has also established two regional action groups to work with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies in helping accelerate the rollout of broadband and mobile services at local level. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band.\u00a0 This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. <\/p>  <p>  In my Department's estimates for 2017 I have secured an &euro;8m provision for RT&Eacute; to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.\u00a0 ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate\u00a0this spectrum, to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband\u00a0services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated. <\/p>  <p>  The procurement process is underway and the three bidders in the process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland.\u00a0 Intensive dialogue with bidders is ongoing, with a view to putting in place contract(s) that will deliver the NBP network and put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300080#WRX05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Television Reception","counter":1503,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300080#WRX05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1504,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[39533\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300080#WRX05400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding television reception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1505,"content":"<p>RT&Eacute; is responsible for the roll-out, coverage and operation of the SAORVIEW digital terrestrial television (DTT) network and I, as Minister, have no function in this matter.\u00a0The Broadcasting\u00a0Act 2009\u00a0requires RT&Eacute; to provide digital coverage to the same extent as provided over the previous analogue network, i.e. 98% population coverage, and I am advised by RT&Eacute; that this level of coverage is being provided by the SAORVIEW TV network.\u00a0For the remaining 2% of the population, RT&Eacute; launched SAORSAT in March 2012. The development and provision of SAORSAT, which is a &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; satellite system providing access to the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4, was undertaken by RT&Eacute; on its own initiative and, as in the case of the SAORVIEW DTT network, is not a matter in which I have a function.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is not the only country to have introduced a national TV network on both a terrestrial and satellite platform.

However, through SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, Ireland now has 100% &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.<\/p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0area referred to by the Deputy falls within the AMBER area and\u00a0will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.\u00a0\u00a0Over 750,000 premises are currently within the State intervention area. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area including approximately 34,000\u00a0premises in Co Limerick, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. \u00a0Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time\u00a0to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. <\/p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline\u00a0to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>  <p>  In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. I expect the Taskforce to report shortly. <\/p>  <p>  I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band,\u00a0to provide an 86% increase in total\u00a0 spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.  I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to\u00a0provide\u00a0enhanced mobile services. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile\u00a0telecoms\u00a0services. <\/p>  <p>  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country, including County Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300081#WRY01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commission for Energy Regulation","counter":1543,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300081#WRY01775"},{"type":"question","counter":1544,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[39953\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300081#WRY01800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding the use of 1850 numbers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1545,"content":"<p>The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) manages and administers the National Numbering Scheme which lists all numbers and codes that are available for use on public telecommunications networks.

These regulations transposed the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive 2014\/35\/EU into Irish law and replaced the European Communities (Low Voltage Electrical Equipment) Regulations 1992 and 1994 which implemented the requirements of the previous Low Voltage Directive 73\/23\/EEC.<\/p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of domestic and EU competition and consumer law in the State and, as such, is charged with enforcing S.I. 345 of 2016.

We have a number of commitments in the Programme for Government relating to enabling access to high quality and affordable childcare.  I am determined to deliver on these commitments. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) in September 2017 will provide more accessible and more affordable childcare both on a universal and a targeted basis, to families.  This will represent a major milestone in childcare in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Since September 2016, the extension of ECCE had made free pre-school available, for 15 hours per week, to all children from the time they turn three, until they go to school.  Children can enter at three points in the year.  On average, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the current provision of 38 weeks.  Access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE can reduce the cost of childcare by &euro;4,000 per child.  The current ECCE programme is accommodating 67,000 children and this figure will increase to 127,000 next year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department extended the terms of the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme in March 2016 so that it could be provided by private childcare providers across the country as well as community\/not-for-profit providers.  This was to ensure that eligible families, regardless of where they live, can access this important childcare subvention.  The full rate of CCS reduces childcare costs by &euro;95 per week, and is available to parents in receipt of social welfare payments including the One Parent Family Payment or Family Income Supplement.  This Scheme will continue in existence until the new Scheme is introduced in September 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing childcare.  This review will be overseen by my Department and will include analysis of the potential benefits and risks of imposing price caps on childcare providers.  The results will be considered in the context of the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is committed to the provision of childcare options for families that reflect international evidence on how to attain the best outcomes for children.  The Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland was established in 2015 to identify and assess policies and future options for increasing the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland.  The IDG examined international evidence on childcare provision, specifically those that addressed affordability and quality.  Supply side measures were found to be more optimal for reform and quality improvement.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme is an example of a supply side approach and reflects a core recommendation of the IDG to replace the existing targeted childcare schemes, which are administratively complex and inadequate in terms of accessibility, with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme responds to a specific need to increase the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300084#WRBB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children and Family Services Provision","counter":1774,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300084#WRBB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1775,"qnumday":669,"qnumall":"[40194\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300084#WRBB04500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if Tusla has a dedicated working group providing support for children and parents living in emergency accommodation in view of their needs, due to the specific impacts on children in emergency accommodation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1776,"content":"<p>My Department, as part of a whole-Government approach to homelessness is committed to helping families by supporting implementation of <i>Rebuilding Ireland: the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/i>Tusla, in addition to the measures set out below, is represented in the structures overseeing the implementation of this Action Plan<\/p><p>Together with Tusla, we are working to support parents and children in order to minimise, as much as possible, the impacts of living in emergency accommodation.

Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.  The significant turnover of personnel that is the norm in military services requires targeted recruitment so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels.

Although this should help them become more familiar with what it is like to be a soldier and also help them to decide whether they might like to be one, it should be noted there is not a direct route from this programme into the Defence Forces.  Those who would like to join the Defence Forces would have to apply through the normal recruitment competitions but I would expect that their exposure to a military environment together with the skills they will attain through participation in the scheme and the improvement in their standard of physical fitness should be an advantage to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300085#WRCC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Terrorism","counter":1852,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300085#WRCC03425"},{"type":"question","counter":1853,"qnumday":696,"qnumall":"[40155\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016121300085#WRCC03500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he expects to be in a position to augment any deficiencies in the Defence Forces in the context of a terrorist attack; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1854,"content":"<p>Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.
