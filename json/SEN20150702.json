I am pleased to inform him that the Minister has introduced a retention rate of 53 pupils for a three-teacher school for the coming school year.<\/p> <p>The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts are published annually on the Department website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.<\/p> <p>The staffing arrangements for the 2015-2016 school year are set out in circular 0005\/2015, which is available on the Department website.  These arrangements include details of the implementation of two new policies which the Minister announced in February 2015, namely, improved retention thresholds for the second, third and fourth classroom teacher and the improved appointment and retention thresholds for isolated one-teacher schools.<\/p> <p>Under these arrangements, the retention figure for a two classroom teacher school has been reduced from 20 pupils to 19.  For a three classroom teacher school, the retention figure has been reduced from 56 pupils to 53 and in four classroom teacher schools, an enrolment of 83 pupils, rather than the previous 86, is required to retain the fourth classroom teacher.<\/p> <p>The introduction of these changes means that schools with three teachers that had an enrolment of 53 pupils on 30 September 2014 will retain their third teacher for the 2015-2016 school year.  Previously, such schools would have lost a teacher as the retention figure for the third teacher was 56 pupils.<\/p> <p>In addition to the reduced retention figures, a threshold of 15 pupils applies for the appointment and retention of the second classroom teacher for schools situated 8 km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and-or language of instruction.<\/p> <p>The two new policies will provide some improvement to the staffing levels of some of our smallest schools.  These improvements particularly recognise the challenges faced by very small schools that are more than 8 km from the next nearest school of the same type.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This package of measures will provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools, recognising the essential social function which small schools can play, especially in isolated communities.<\/p><p>The staffing arrangements also include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board.  A school with four classroom teachers or less which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional teacher can submit an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board.  Where such schools can provide evidence that the enrolment will increase sufficiently in the coming September so as to allow the post to be retained for the following school year, a classroom post may be allocated on appeal.

This matter relates to the provision of a special needs assistant for a particular child who shall re-enter mainstream school in September.  His parents are about to appeal the decision on the grounds that they do not believe the criteria of the Department of Education and Skills was met.  The reality is that he requires, particularly in his formative years, a lot of help and attention which can only be provided by a special needs assistant in the classroom.  He has been granted four and half hours of resource help but it is insufficient for his needs.  If he does not get the support, he will fail to reach his potential and he may end up becoming dependent on State supports rather than the independent young man who his parents believe he can become once he receives support at this critical time.<\/p> <p>He currently behind his peer group in terms of his educational competence and that is further supplemented by his particular self-care needs.  He is a nine year old boy but as he has grown, he has become more aware of the level at which his classmates are compared with himself and he has become frustrated as a result.  In the absence of SNA support in the classroom, he is likely to fall further behind as he becomes more frustrated, a view supported by a professional opinion.<\/p> <p>The discharge report dated March of this year from the speech and language therapy class he attended for two years highlights that he continues to have severe difficulties with receptive and expressive language skills.  In the notes, it is stated that he will continue to need support in the school given his dual diagnosis of developmental co-ordination disorder and specific language impairment, as well as his difficulties with working memory and processing speed, as assessed by a psychologist.  The report also stated that not only will he find it hard to access the curriculum because of this, but that it would support any application made for additional help. <\/p> <p>Recently, the boy has been referred to the primary care clinical psychology services under the Disability Act 2005 and the child development team for an autism spectrum disorder assessment.  He is waiting for the team to carry out a multidisciplinary assessment which has led to a delay in getting an updated professional report to identify his needs.  I mention the delay in carrying out an assessment because the NCSE mentioned that it wanted a more recent report than the 2013 report that it has on file.  <\/p> <p>The 2013 report stated that he should have access to a special needs assistant.  Despite interventions by various teams on a one-to-one basis, he is still in serious need of a classroom assistant.  Classroom assistance is not just relevant to his receptive and expressive language skills but to his self-care needs.  I will not go into the detail here but they are very important.  The information that the NCSE has, coupled with the result of an assessment that I hope will soon take place, underlines and illustrates the breadth and gravity of the additional supports that he needs.  It especially highlights the full-time classroom support that he needs.  His needs would be above those of other children of the same age who do not share his diagnosis.<\/p> <p>Under the current rules to qualify for a special needs assistant, a child generally must be on the more extreme side in terms of needs and are require assistance with feeding, going to the toilet or lifting.  This particular child meets a lot of those criteria and the 2013 report stated that he would need a special needs assistant.  He was two years away from the mainstream education to which he will return in September.  That addressed some of his needs but not all of them.  The report states that he has severe difficulties, in particular with language skills.  He has had some one-to-one sessions about self-care but they have not been successful in terms of long-term practical application.  Therefore, he still needs the care and assistance in the classroom that a full-time SNA would provide.  <\/p> <p>The boy has been given four and half hours of resource teaching but it is only a drop in the ocean in terms of meeting his needs in the classroom.  I do not usually raise individual cases in the Seanad but his parents approached me.  I have dealt with them for a long time and know them very well.  This issue is of grave concern to them.  His mother is frantic with worry that a lack of a special needs assistant will stunt his development completely and he will be left behind in terms of educational and self-care issues.  He has not reached the same standard as other children his own age who are becoming aware that he has particular needs and they are starting to point them out which has made him feel self-conscious.  It is not just his educational development but his personal development that is being affected and that is why I raise this issue today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015070200002#B00400","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1435829400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter today.  I wish to assure the House that the education of children with special educational needs remains a key priority for this Government.  We have been resolutely committed to protecting and, in some instances, increasing the level of investment being made to support children with special educational needs at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure reductions across a range of areas.  It is an area of spending which has been prioritised above most other areas by this Government, despite the enormous pressures on all areas of public spending.  This year alone, over &euro;1.37 billion or 15% of the Department's budget is being spent to provide supports to enable learners with special educational needs access an education appropriate to their needs.<\/p> <p>The SNA scheme, in particular, has been a major factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education, and the provision of support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.  As part of budget 2015, the Minister announced that an additional 365 SNA posts will be provided in 2015 to take into account increased demand and demographic growth and to ensure that children can continue to have access to additional supports in school.  There is now provision for 11,330 SNA posts in 2015 which is the highest level of SNA provision that we have ever had.  These increases, building on increases which have already been provided in recent years, will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.<\/p> <p>I want to take this opportunity to assure the House that schools, which have enrolled children who qualify for support from an SNA, will continue to be allocated SNA support.  The House will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, is responsible for allocating resource teachers and SNAs to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support and these criteria are set out in Department's circular 30\/2014.<\/p> <p>All schools were asked to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2015-2016 school year by 18 March 2015.  The NCSE continued to accept applications after this date in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.  On conclusion of this process, the NCSE evaluated the level of SNAs required to meet the needs of schools for the coming year and advised the Department on the quantum of SNAs that would need to be provided to meet this need.  Advice from the NCSE has been received and the Department is working to finalise its consideration of this as quickly as possible.  Details of SNA allocations to schools for 2015-2016 will be available on the NCSE website on completion of this process.<\/p> <p>The Senator's specific query relates to the allocation of an SNA for an individually named child.  It is important this House is aware that SNA allocations are not made to individual children but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs, like the example given.  I will ask the NCSE to examine the matter and to respond directly to the Senator.  I thank her once again for raising this matter and I will make sure it is followed up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015070200002#B00500","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1435829400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

Apparently, there are a number of unlicensed auctioneers operating throughout the State.

The authority is independent in the performance of its functions.<\/p><p>A key role of the authority is to set and enforce standards in the provision of property services by property service providers who fall into four categories - auctioneers of all types, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents.  The 2011 Act provides for the licensing of all companies and individuals engaged in the provision of property services.  There are currently in excess of 4,000 companies and individuals licensed to provide property services.  A publicly visible register of these licensees is maintained on the PSRA website at <i>www.psra.ie<\/i>.Under section 28 of the Act, it is an offence to provide a property service, or purport to be available to provide a property service, unless the person is appropriately licensed.  A company or person who contravenes this section of the Act is liable to a fine or imprisonment, or both.<\/p><p>It is the authority's policy to prosecute all of those found to be trading without a licence.  A number of prosecutions have already been before the courts in the Dublin area.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has been informed that two cases have so far resulted in convictions and more cases are pending.  She has been advised by the authority that 242 instances of companies or individuals suspected to be trading without a licence have been brought to its attention since 2012.  Some 23% of these cases involved companies of individuals who were, in fact, already licensed.  A letter campaign instructing companies to cease trading without licences resulted in a further 6% applying for and being granted licences.  Another 31% have ceased trading or were never trading in the first place and no current evidence can be found of trading.

I stress that I am fully committed to road safety.  In my time as a county councillor I made many representations on planning matters.  In cases in which disputes arise and there is any shred of doubt or difficulty about road safety, we must always err on the side of caution. <\/p> <p>I have encountered a significant number of cases where, despite road safety, sight distance, etc., not being compromised or in doubt, the NRA's blanket policy has impinged on a council's decision on whether to grant planning permission for houses on national secondary roads.  In one case in north County Cork, in which I was not involved, the authority successfully appealed a decision by Cork County Council to grant planning permission for a residence for a small business operation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  While I fully respect the road safety perspective of the National Roads Authority - long may it continue - individual cases must be considered from a social and economic perspective from time to time.  In cases in which a farming son or daughter is unable to build a house on the family farm, we will have a ridiculous scenario in which the applicant will be obliged to build or buy a house three or four miles away and traverse the secondary route in question several times a day.  Some dairy farmers will visit a farm two or three times in the middle of the night during the calving season.  The broader safety perspective must also be taken into account.<\/p> <p>In so far as the Minister has powers in this area, I ask him to liaise with the National Roads Authority to ascertain whether there is a reasonable prospect of council engineers discussing individual cases with a local office of the National Roads Authority in an effort to alleviate problems.  I am reluctant to call for discretionary powers, as this term is a throwback to all the funny political decisions made in the past.  The number of cases involved is probably not more than a few dozen, or three or four per county, at any given time and certainly does not run into the hundreds.  On a day when the Government is launching what will, I hope, be a visionary policy on agrifood and rural areas, it is important to ensure that farming families are facilitated in living on the family farm.  This will require a careful examination of planning issues.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for listening.  I do not expect him to perform miracles today.  I ask him to discuss with the National Roads Authority the possibility of shifting its black and white policy towards one in which there is a prospect of dialogue in individual cases.  County councils will not approve a planning application if there are any doubts about road safety.  As a result of a national policy pursued by the National Roads Authority, they are now reluctant to give serious consideration to planning applications for dwellings alongside national secondary roads.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the issue with a view to improving the current position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015070200002#D00300","speaker":"1189"},{"type":"speech","time":1435829400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Cathaoirleach and Senator Bradford for keeping them waiting.

In any case, I extend my best wishes to him in his endeavours and do so in the same spirit as he extended his best wishes to me.<\/p> <p>The short answer to the Senator's question is that I am open to examining this issue.  This should initially involve engagement with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on planning decisions made by local authorities.<\/p> <p>I am aware of the issue the Senator raises, as it has been brought to my attention previously.  I take a similar approach to it as he does, and I expect those who are involved in the relevant decisions to adopt a similar approach.  This means, as the Senator acknowledged, that while primacy must be given to road safety, we must also seek to facilitate a relatively small number of developments or applications as a means of supporting ongoing changes in agricultural families and communities.<\/p> <p>Having raised matters related to funding previously, Senator Bradford will be aware of the policy background to this issue and my responsibilities in this regard.  I have responsibility for overall policy and funding, while the National Roads Authority has a statutory responsibility under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007.  The NRA works with local authorities in performing its duties under the legislation.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, commented on this matter and acknowledged that decisions as to whether to grant planning permission in any particular case are a matter for the relevant planning authority, whether a local authority or, on appeal, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  <\/p> <p>Local authorities must have regard to the local development plan, any relevant ministerial or Government policies, and national guidelines.  All of this work must be completed within the framework of planning legislation.  As a statutory consultee under planning legislation, submissions or comments on planning applications and proposed developments constitute the National Roads Authority's primary input into the planning process.  My understanding is that the approach adopted by the authority in making such submissions or comments is to seek to uphold official policy and guidelines.<\/p> <p>Senator Bradford acknowledged the importance of road safety.  As he is aware, access to roads must be managed, as must conditions on roads.  Access is particularly restricted in the case of national roads, to which speed limits of 60 km\/h apply, whereas a less restrictive approach is allowed for in the case of transitional zones close to urban centres and within 50 km\/h zones.  The Road Safety Authority's strategy for the period from 2013 to 2020 includes an action to reduce the number of access points outside speed limit areas on national roads by 5% by 2020.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I accept this will have consequences for road users, particularly people who are seeking to develop or access roads.  However, I am sure the Senator will appreciate that from a Road Safety Authority point of view, the two main issues are the frequency with which additional vehicles access roads, particularly national roads that can be very busy, and the speed at which those vehicles access those roads, which often is very different from the speed at which vehicles already on that road are travelling.  This can have consequences for road safety that need to be managed.  <\/p><p>As stated by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, under section 2.6 of the guidelines, in exceptional circumstances planning authorities may identify stretches of national roads where a less restrictive approach may be applied, but only as part of the process of reviewing or varying the relevant development plan and having consulted and had regard to the advice of the NRA in line with the approach set out in the guidelines.  It is a matter for planning authorities to consider the implementation of section 2.6 of the guidelines in respect of sections of relevant national roads and in the context of the development plan for that region, county or area.<\/p><p>As I said earlier, I am open to looking at the issue in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government but I do not want to create expectations about potential changes in the guidelines as this could lead to further expectations to which I would then have to respond, and, primarily, because of the impact this would have on the progress we are making in relation to road safety.  I have listened to the points made by the Senator and I agree this is an issue that merits further examination.  My Department will engage on the matter with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in the context of the planning laws already in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015070200002#D00400","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435829400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.15 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1435829400,"counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015070200002#G00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1435829400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>The Order of Business is No. 1, Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2015 - Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 12.45 p.m. and adjourn no later than 3 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 2, Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2013 - Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken at 3 p.m. and to adjourn no later than 5 p.m., if not previously concluded.

I know the Leader has requested the Minister to come here about that.  The scheme is far too cumbersome and it is not getting the traction we thought it would.  There are major problems relating to the local property tax exemption, as many home owners suffering pyrite issues are not being given the local property tax exemption promised as part of the legislation.  The Department and the Revenue Commissioners are insisting on a specific test that can cost up to &euro;3,000, so why would anybody bother seeking an exemption in such circumstances?

I have raised this issue over the last two weeks and I am trying to be helpful, as we are not getting the answers we should from the HSE or the Department of Health.  I will circulate the motion to all Senators later today seeking their support and I will be looking for a specific debate next week, even if it is for only half an hour.  Members might let me know by close of business next Tuesday whether they are willing to support it.  If anyone reads the testimony published on <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>last night of someone waiting for a pancreas transplant, they will see that she feels the rug has been pulled from under her.  There is no access to pancreas transplant co-ordinators and we have no pancreatic surgeon.  The post remains vacant.  I ask Members to put their names to the motion if they feel they can, as the Seanad has a role in this regard.

I advise colleagues that this Bill started life as a Private Members' Bill introduced by Senator Moran and myself on behalf of the Labour Party in March 2013.  On Second Stage, 11 Members spoke and, as such, there is significant interest in the legislation, which is intended to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act to ensure that discrimination against teachers, in particular, on the basis of sexuality or family status will no longer be possible.  It is a very important Bill and there is great interest in it from civil society, the unions and LGBT rights groups.  It was delayed and we had Committee Stage over two dates in March 2014, at which time there was again a great deal of interest from colleagues.  In light of that, we are scheduling the resumption of Committee Stage, which will hopefully conclude this evening, as the Government has now approved a set of amendments for Report Stage.  We hope Report Stage will take place next week.  Those Senators who tabled amendments on Committee Stage, Senators Zappone and Power, have been briefed by the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and a further briefing has been arranged for next Tuesday, 7 July, at 3 p.m. for all Senators with an interest in the Bill so that people can have a full briefing on what the Report Stage amendments will entail.  The meeting will take place in meeting room C in LH 2000.  I have circulated a notice on that at the request of the Minister of State.  It is a very important Bill and it is a good day for the Seanad to see it progress as a Government Bill, having started life as a Private Members' Bill.  It is broadly welcomed on both sides of the House.<\/p> <p>I also welcome the announcement this week, which other colleagues spoke about yesterday, of the extension of GP cards to all children under 18 who receive a cancer diagnosis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, announced it earlier this week and it is a hugely important and very welcome extension.  Finally, I commend Alcohol Action Ireland, the alcohol health alliance, for the work it is doing in support of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which was published in February 2015 and which will provide for minimum pricing of alcohol and various restrictions on alcohol advertising.

These people have jobs, but those low-paid, low-quality jobs are not in any way lifting them out of poverty.  The Government says the cuts and changes are going through so lone parents can get a job and no longer be poor, but we have evidence to the contrary.  It just does not work that way.  In fact, I am getting reports from some lone parents today that the new cut payment is not in their bank accounts yet.  Can the Cathaoirleach imagine how they must feel?  Even the bureaucracy appears to be getting it wrong and it is causing distress.<\/p> <p>My first question to the Leader is whether he can confirm that all lone parents will get their payment today and explain why it is not there now.  Many Members in both Houses protested vehemently against the cuts as recently as last night, but our voices have fallen on deaf ears.

Yesterday, I published findings from a civic forum that I held in Leinster House, attended by more than 30 lone parents, at which we debated what changes they wanted to see so that they and their children might have an equal chance to flourish in Ireland.  With its publication, I call on Government to immediately establish a special working group with a predominance of lone parents and their representatives to review the cuts and conditions in one-parent family policies and to feed their recommendations into budget preparations, beginning with the national economic dialogue that will be held later this month.<\/p> <p>That brings me to my other question.

People travelling in their cars to collect their children after work, some of whom might have been lone parents, could not collect them because of the protest.  These people did not care.

I propose that No. 67, motion No. 16 on the Order Paper, be taken before No. 1 today.<\/p> <p>I support those Members of the House who referred to yesterday's disgraceful and anti-democratic scenes outside this House of democracy.  Senator Moran is right.  I attempted to move my car at 3.30 p.m. and was confronted by a line of garda&iacute; at the front gate.  In front of them were at least 40 or 50 anarchists who certainly had no interest whatsoever in democracy and were only concerned about starting a fight.  The garda&iacute;, in discharging their duties, attempted to clear a way for my car to make its way out.  As Senator Kelly said, I had an appointment that I had to go to - I had no choice - and the car was parked at the front of the House, not the back.  The garda&iacute; tried to clear a way in the most diplomatic manner possible.  There was no attempt to push or shove people but rather to move them out of the way, yet the garda&iacute; were immediately set upon.  iPhones were produced, and there were shouts of abuse and \"Shame\" because the garda&iacute; were attempting to do their duty in what I thought was a very diplomatic and orderly fashion.  People stood in front of the car, totally oblivious to the pleas of the garda&iacute; that they move.  I eventually withdrew, reversed back in and took a taxi to my appointment, as I did not really want to put the garda&iacute; under any extra pressure.  Subsequently, a garda was injured.  There was no question in my mind that if I had persisted and if the garda&iacute; had continued to attempt to allow me out there would have been injuries to the garda&iacute;, and I was not prepared to subject them to that.<\/p> <p>We engaged with some of these anarchists a little later on, as Senator Kelly said, and we might as well have been engaging with the wall.  One of them actually said, when I put it to him that it was most unlikely that he would be allowed to do what he was doing in any other country, that this was his country and he was entitled to.  I said \"Yes, you are entitled, but what about the rights of other people?\".  That was what seemed to be missing yesterday afternoon.  <\/p> <p>I want to separate what happened in the afternoon from what went on later.  I have no doubt there were people who were there legitimately to protest, and they were perfectly entitled to do so.  Indeed, a Member of this House who had expressed a particular view earlier in the day was actually one of those on the platform later on.  I do not want to be critical of him in any way for taking a party line.  It gives an indication of the depth of feeling among all parties and none about what was going on in the earlier part of the afternoon.<\/p> <p>I hope the Leader will answer my next question, in light of the fact that the Garda Commissioner will be coming before the other House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paschal Mooney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1990\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1990&amp;amp;pid=PaschalMooney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=02\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Given the Garda and the authorities must have known in advance that there was to be a protest, why were these people allowed to congregate in front of the gates of Leinster House?

It is appalling that many families who, as we know from the statistics, struggle economically to rear their children and make ends meet, as well as being below the poverty line, are being abandoned by the Government.  As Senator Healy Eames said, the Minister gave a commitment that none of this would be triggered until such time as there were adequate child care facilities in place to enable such women to work.  The cost of child care in this country is prohibitive for anyone on a modest income.  I ask the Minister to revisit the decision at this late stage.<\/p> <p>There is an interesting resolution before the 29th session of the Human Rights Council of the UN, which is currently under way in Geneva, entitled \"Protection of the family: The contribution of the family to the realisation of the right to adequate standard of living for its members particularly through its role in poverty irradiation and achieving sustainable development.\"  It could not be more pertinent in view of the debate we had today on lone parents.  The resolutions includes a number of points.  It urges member states to create a conducive environment to strengthen and support all families; underlines that the family has the primary responsibility for nurturing and protecting children from infancy to adolescence; states that the introduction of children to the cultural values and norms of their society begins in the family; urges states to take appropriate measures to ensure that a child is not separated from his or her parents against his or her will, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child; and reaffirms the right of the child to education and states that education should be directed to the development of the child's personality, talents and mental and physical abilities.  Ireland is a member of the UN Human Rights Council.  It is more in hope than expectation that I say I expect Ireland to support this, given the record of the Government on child protection and the family.  In the event that Ireland does not support or opposes the resolution, I ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House to explain why an anti-family course of action was taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015070200002#M00600","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1435829400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>For the past number of days I have asked for an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that the Minister for Social Protection be brought to the House to discuss the issue of lone parents.

It is a template which follows the strategy introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, known as Food Harvest 2020.  It is a ten-year blueprint for agricultural development and the agrifood sector.  However, the sheep sector is currently at a crossroads and is facing a major crisis.  According to the current flock register, there are 3.53 million sheep in the county.  There are around 450,000 in my county and some 5,500 flocks.  In the past fortnight alone, the price per head for a ewe or lamb going to a factory has fallen by &euro;17 on average.
