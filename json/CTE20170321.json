Before setting out some information and details regarding the initiative, I will briefly introduce myself and my colleague, Ms &Aacute;ine Maher.  We are part of the inward investment team in the innovation and investment division of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We work closely with IDA Ireland on issues, be they budgetary, administrative or financial, concerning the agency and more broadly on the implementation of effective foreign direct investment policy in Ireland.  This includes the Succeed in Ireland initiative, which is the subject of the committee's deliberations today.<\/p> <p>  The Succeed in Ireland programme was borne out of the 2011 Global Irish Economic Forum.  The concept behind the initiative was, in essence, to engage individual members of the Irish diaspora in helping to attract new foreign direct investment to Ireland in return for a financial award.  The Government asked the IDA to oversee Succeed in Ireland, and following a tender in August 2011, ConnectIreland, a subsidiary of the Taxback Group, was appointed to implement the initiative.  The programme was subsequently launched as part of the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs, with a target of creating 5,000 new employment positions in Ireland.  It has been in operation since then and has contributed to the Government's efforts to win more foreign direct investment and jobs for the people of Ireland.  According to the IDA, which is responsible for its oversight, 535 positions have been created through the initiative.  As a financial reward is due in respect of each job that has been verified as having been created on the ground, ConnectIreland has received payments to date totalling &euro;2.11 million from IDA Ireland.  This figure does not include an additional &euro;150,000 which ConnectIreland received from the IDA for marketing support.  I should point out that the figure of 535, representing the total number of jobs created to date by the initiative, may yet increase.  This is because jobs generated by approved projects under the programme will continue to be counted up until March 2020.  Moreover, the verification process for any such jobs will continue to operate until March 2022.<\/p> <p>  As regards the conclusion of the contract underpinning the programme, it was originally due to end in March 2016.  However, in advance of that date, ConnectIreland and the IDA agreed to extend it for a further 12-month period.  The express purpose of that extension, which was mutually agreed by both parties, was to effect an orderly wind-down of the original agreement signed in 2012.  The original agreement is now set to conclude on 26 March, this coming Sunday.  The IDA has advised the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that granting a further extension to the agreement, which would allow the programme to continue beyond 26 March, would legally not be permissible.  This is because of public procurement law which provides that in this instance a new tender would be necessary before a further contract could be entered into.<\/p> <p>  At its meeting in November 2016, the board of IDA considered the future of Succeed in Ireland and whether a new tender should be issued in 2017 for its continuation.  The board made the decision not to re-tender and the agency informed the Department of this immediately thereafter.  The fact the IDA board opted against retendering in November 2016 does not necessarily mean - this is an important point to make - that a definitive decision has been taken in respect of the long-term future of the initiative.  There is nothing to prevent, for example, the IDA from deciding to proceed with a tender for a further Succeed in Ireland programme at a later stage.  The IDA has decided instead not to pursue that route at this point.  The conclusion of the contract will also allow us to take stock of the programme and the contribution it has made to employment generation in the State.<\/p> <p>  We will be aided in this process by a review which, on the instructions of the Minister, will shortly be commissioned by the Department.  In short, this review will allow for a full and comprehensive assessment of the costs and impact of Succeed in Ireland.  Once completed, it will improve our understanding of how the initiative has functioned, its strengths and weaknesses and, crucially, how we could improve it for the future.  As made clear by the Minister it is important that this review be undertaken before a determination is made on the ultimate future of the programme.  The committee should be aware that the terms of reference for this review have not yet been finalised.  A decision on the start date and authorship will be taken in due course following the conclusion of the current Succeed in Ireland contract.  Confirmation of details concerning the review, once finalised, can be supplied to the committee in due course.<\/p> <p>  I want now to turn briefly to the well-publicised differences that have arisen between ConnectIreland and the IDA regarding the operation of the initiative.  While this is unfortunate, it is the case that the contract between the parties provides for a procedure to resolve any such differences.  This dispute resolution mechanism has been triggered and I understand the two sides have been engaged in efforts, pursuant to that contractual provision, to find a solution.<\/p><p>That process remains ongoing, and the Minister is hopeful that a mutually acceptable outcome can be reached for both parties.  As the committee will appreciate, I am unfortunately precluded from commenting any further on the substance of this dispute or anything in connection with it in the event that I inadvertently prejudice the position of either of the parties in any future proceedings.<\/p><p> The Minister has asked me to emphasise that the attraction of further foreign direct investment to Ireland will remain an absolute priority of hers in the time ahead.  The Government, together with the IDA, is continuing to do its utmost to attract more overseas companies to expand or locate here and to create new employment opportunities.  ConnectIreland, through its operation of the Succeed in Ireland programme, has made a useful contribution to the collective efforts made in recent years to win more FDI for Ireland.  The Minister is grateful for this contribution.  We look forward to undertaking a review of the programme to be in a better position to make a determination as to how to proceed with Succeed in Ireland.<\/p><p> I am now happy to answer any questions the committee may have.  I may not, however, be able to address certain operational or legal queries in connection with the programme for reasons I have just described.  I trust the committee understands why that is the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017032100002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Scannell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490094000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Scannell.

It is a large organisation and was invited here on a number of occasions, such as during the Brexit exercise we undertook.  It came before the committee on that occasion, as did the IDA, and I wish to put that on the record.  It is simply not good enough.  This is coming off the back of St. Patrick's Day and the diplomatic offensive in which this country has traditionally engaged over the years in reaching out to the diaspora.  The core business of ConnectIreland is exactly that: connecting with our diaspora to try to promote economic activity in the country.  I ask that we write to these two organisations again.<\/p><p>We should demand that they come before us so we can register with them our disapproval and the fact that it is disrespectful to the Houses of the Oireachtas and, by extension, to the people of Ireland.

I find it incredible that the Department is still drafting the terms of the review.  Deputy Quinlivan was right in how he reacted to the answer.

A number of weeks have now elapsed yet the Department is coming in here and saying that the review is still being drafted, that we will have it in due course and that a decision will ultimately be taken, but we do not know who is taking the decision.  It appears that IDA Ireland is happy to let the clock run out on this.  I am at a loss to know who exactly has the responsibility for driving this review.  Is anybody within the Department, from the Minister down, concerned that the current initiative will cease on 26 March, that we will then go into a period of drift and that the momentum that has been built and the connections that have been made could potentially come to naught?  This is despite all the work that has been done and the money spent.  Mr. Scannell outlined the amount of money that has been paid to ConnectIreland to date.<\/p> <p>  I find what is happening incredible.  Is this is what the Department is serving up to us at this point, namely, that the review is being drafted?

That is very much at the heart of what we are discussing here today.<\/p> <p>  I place on record my appreciation of the work of ConnectIreland particularly in rural areas.  I was instrumental in developing, with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the agencies, the regional Action Plan for Jobs approach.

ConnectIreland, for obvious reasons, would favour a bridging contract arrangement being provided.

I do not mean that disrespectfully but he has told us absolutely nothing in relation to the key issues here.  Like my colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, I have to express my huge disappointment at IDA Ireland's decision not to attend, Enterprise Ireland's decision not to attend and the Minister's decision not to attend. To be frank, something very strange is going on here when no one wants to turn up and when the people who do are extremely restricted in what they can say.  I find it odd.<\/p> <p>  I do not mean to be flippant but my first question is do the people here now report to IDA Ireland?  If they do not - and I take it that they do not - then perhaps they could tell us why the Department accepted IDA Ireland's decision not to retender.<\/p> <p>  One thing in particular puzzles me.  My understanding was that the wind-down period - that last 12 months - was to allow for a retender to take place.  We have not been given any credible reason why that retendering did not take place.  This seems to be a very cynical exercise designed to wind down time and then say that there was nothing that could be done.  We are up against it now in terms of next Sunday.<\/p> <p>  I live in rural Ireland.  I think ConnectIreland has done a huge service to the country.  The Department's statement refers to the absolute priority to attract further foreign direct investment to Ireland.  How does the Department reconcile that with the fact that it is going to close ConnectIreland on Sunday?  I am absolutely stunned.  There is something really odd about this.<\/p><p>It is completely unacceptable that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland decided to duck the issue today in the hope that time would run out.  I hope I speak for every committee member when I say that we are not going to allow this to happen.  It is beyond reasonable and beyond what the taxpayer should tolerate.  ConnectIreland delivered jobs to rural Ireland which the IDA will not because it only works with projects of 30 employees and upwards.  Many of the ConnectIreland projects involve smaller job numbers.  There is a gap there.  We are facing into Brexit and this committee has spent much time dealing with the challenges of Brexit.  At the very time it is about to hit us, the Department is shutting down one of the key elements in our army to fight back for jobs.

The purpose of the 12-month extension, as I understand it, which was agreed in March 2016, was not to allow for a further tendering.

I will pre-empt the answer to my question by saying that I am a member of this committee because I am interested in the creation of real jobs.  However, I have no way of knowing that the jobs that ConnectIreland or IDA Ireland bring to this country are well paid and that the workers who take them up are looked after.  From time to time, companies attracted here by way of foreign direct investment are brought to my attention by those who work for them.  I am interested in this committee discussing ways to save jobs at Bus &Eacute;ireann and An Post and how we can attract nurses back to the country.  We never seem to discuss those issues, however.  We are always discussing foreign direct investment and where it is leading us.

If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

It is a tremendous privilege for ConnectIreland to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to present a successful job creation initiative, primarily for rural Ireland, of which we are very proud.  Before reading my presentation, I wish to offer our sincere condolences to those in Sinn F&eacute;in on the loss of their colleague last night.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of ConnectIreland's appearance before the committee is to appeal for a bridging contract to allow us to continue to operate the Succeed in Ireland initiative, preferably with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The contract for Succeed in Ireland is due to expire on Sunday next.  Recently, the Minister for Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, confirmed in the D&aacute;il that she has asked her Department for a review to be conducted on the initiative after it has been terminated.  ConnectIreland welcomes the review but we respectfully request that it be independent, that it be carried out by third party and that it include the experience of ConnectIreland in implementing this programme, overseen by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We have received tremendous support from tens of thousands of loyal members of the Irish diaspora who continue to introduce valuable leads every day, thereby benefiting rural Ireland.  We wish only to continue the work that we do until that review has been concluded and recommendations arrived at.  We see no advantage in the discontinuation of this vital job creation programme before the review is complete.<\/p> <p>  ConnectIreland is a not-for-profit patriotic initiative founded by Terry Clune to operate the Succeed in Ireland initiative to bring jobs to Ireland in the wake of the recent financial crisis.  The initiative is an idea which came from the Global Irish Economic Forum in 2011.  It utilises Ireland's relationship with its diaspora and global connections to persuade companies to move to Ireland.  The way it works is simple: people - connectors - who know someone planning to move a company into Europe will get in touch with ConnectIreland which will then provide a wide range of supports to that company to help it decide to choose Ireland.  For passing on the lead, the connector will receive a reward of &euro;1,500 for every job created.  ConnectIreland has operated under the auspices of Industrial Development Agency, IDA, Ireland.<\/p> <p>  ConnectIreland has proved very successful in bringing small companies to Ireland.  We have also been very successful in bringing jobs to rural Ireland, not just Dublin.  We have brought 82 new-name, greenfield projects to Ireland, with a heavy rural emphasis.  We have had 2,351 jobs approved by IDA Ireland's management investment committee, scaling over three years, with 1,046 jobs already on the ground.  There have been 527 verified by IDA Ireland.  There are almost 80,000 connectors, loyal members of the Irish diaspora who continue to introduce companies to us every day.  They understand the initiative and support its ambitions.  They are an army of volunteers working for Ireland.  I take this opportunity to introduce Mr. James Moran, a connector in the first instance but now also running a company called SLM Connect in Gweedore, Donegal, and his colleague, chief executive of SLM Connect worldwide, Mr. Abdul Salam, who has graciously taken time to travel from Manchester today.  Mr. Moran has travelled from Donegal to tell the committee why they chose Gweedore and why relationships with the Irish diaspora are so important.<\/p> <p>  Beyond what IDA Ireland has approved, we are working with 957 additional companies.<\/p><p>I direct Deputies and Senators to the list which shows the companies with which we are currently engaged and the relationships that will be lost on Sunday should we not be able to continue.  We encourage them to relocate to Ireland.  Should the programme be discontinued, the relationship and trust ConnectIreland has built with them will be lost.  There is no cost to the taxpayer unless jobs have been created.  At &euro;4,000 per job created, of which we share &euro;1,500 with our connectors, the initiative is 250% cheaper per job than the cost for IDA Ireland.  We consider this to be something of which we are very proud.  IDA Ireland's track record in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland is exemplary, but as a new company, we are working with the diaspora to deliver jobs at a much lower cost to the taxpayer, of which we are very proud.  Our connectors are based in 147 countries worldwide.<\/p><p> IDA Ireland is not renewing the contract which is due to expire on Sunday.  We have had some significant challenges in implementing the programme, none of which was getting a lead from the diaspora in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland.  We are committed to resolving these issues.  This is more important than structural difficulties.  We are here because we want to continue to create jobs in Ireland which needs as many channels to job creation as possible.  Closing down ConnectIreland is not in Ireland's national interests.  Shutting down the Succeed in Ireland initiative will have an enormously negative impact on job creation in Ireland.  Our global network will be lost and all jof the jobs in the pipeline will be put at risk.  It will be extremely damaging to Ireland's reputation for thousands of investors.  We will be missing huge opportunities for dozens of small towns in Ireland.  In the context of Brexit, does this make sense?  We see the continuing volatility of the jobs market and global uncertainty on the political landscape which confirm the need to have all possible job creation measures.  This will be another killer blow to rural Ireland.  We need the initiative to be extended to facilitate a review, of which we would be part, and until such a time as a path forward can be found for the initiative.  We plead with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to step in to save jobs in rural Ireland and provide cross-departmental support for ConnectIreland.  ConnectIreland has been the recipient of huge support from various Departments which we acknowledge and also from Irish embassies and consuls, as well as from significant Irish organisations such as the GAA.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017032100002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Joanna Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1490094000,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Murphy for the presentation which was appreciated.

I was born in Manchester and raised in Donegal.  After my leaving certificate, I went to university in the UK and stayed there for a number of years.  I subsequently worked in Dublin and, in recent years, in the US.<\/p> <p>  In 2015, I was working for a US technology company in Manchester.  It shared a building with Mr. Salam's company, SLM Connect, which is a contact centre or call centre organisation.  I got to know Mr. Salam on a personal level.  One day while chatting, he said that he wished to expand his operation outside Manchester, possibly to Wales or Scotland.  I put my green hat on and threw Ireland into the picture.  He was happy to consider that.  I was aware of the ConnectIreland initiative through a friend of mine back home.  I became an approved connector.<\/p><p>When the management of SLM and ConnectIreland subsequently spoke, that set the seed for encouraging the company to set up in County Donegal.  After a few months, when the project was progressing well, Mr. Salam asked me to consider joining the company to look after its Irish operation.  I jumped at the chance for personal reasons.  My mother has been on her own in County Donegal since my father passed away a few years ago.  Her five children are scattered all over the world, as many Irish families are.  I have a sister in the United States and another in New Zealand.  I jumped at the chance to go back home to look after my mother.  She would probably be adamant that it is still a case of her looking after me and she is probably right.<\/p><p> Our operation in County Donegal is off the ground.  We employ 36 people and are looking to increase that number to 125.  Our facility can probably hold approximately 150.  We are hoping to have 50 employees by Easter and 125 within two years.  It has been a great experience.  It is good to be back home.  We have been very impressed by the calibre of people we have managed to get.  It is probable that approximately 50% of our staff have third level degrees.  I am sure they did not envisage working in a call centre or a contact centre when they were in college, but to be fair, they appreciate and are grateful for their jobs.  A few Deputies have hammered home the point that rural jobs are much more important.  People in County Donegal really appreciate their jobs and are committed to making this operation a success.  A significant cohort of our staff had been among the long-term unemployed.  Just as I wanted to move back home to be closer to my mother, many people in County Donegal are tied to the area because of family commitments.  They want to stay in the county in order that they can remain part of the fabric of the community.  The great ConnectIreland initiative is helping us to provide 125 jobs in Gaoth Dobhair in the first phase.  Mr. Salam and I are quite keen to increase the number of jobs provided by the company to between 300 and 500 in the second phase, which might be closer to Letterkenny or one of the other bigger towns in County Donegal.  I reiterate that all of this has been made possible by the ConnectIreland initiative which has enabled me to get in touch with officials to take the project onwards and upwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017032100002#W00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490094000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>With the agreement of the committee, it might be useful at this stage if Mr. Salam were to give colour to the issue we are discussing - the need for employment in very remote parts of Ireland.

I first heard of ConnectIreland when I emigrated in February 2010.  In terms of marketability, ConnectIreland appealed to the ordinary emigrant on the ground as opposed to the key decision makers in established industries across the world.  That was the strategy and key focus at the time, in terms of getting companies to set up in Ireland but also to re-establish our reputation.  The organisation was trying to do that from the ground up; it was a bottom-up approach.  When I went to Australia, I was working in recruitment and every Irish emigrant knew about ConnectIreland within 24 to 48 hours of arriving.  It was a way for emigrants to reconnect with Ireland because most of us were forced to leave.  We never thought we would have to go.  Our country educated us to the hilt, we thought we had endless opportunities and then bang, we had to go, like the generations before us.  We were the first emigrants who were highly educated and we were able to speak in business language with key decision makers in order to attract businesses back to Ireland.  We were the ordinary punters on the ground at the time and that was the strategy behind it.  Indeed, that is where ConnectIreland worked.  I know that the company was spoken about by The Ireland Funds Australia and other network groups.  I wanted to put that on record from my experience on the ground, as a modern emigrant.  That is the way we saw it.  There was an incentive there.  The question was always asked, it was spoken about around the tables - can we get companies back?  We wanted to help the country.  We wanted to give something back and to have that connection, unlike previous generations who, through no fault of their own, did not have that opportunity.  Indeed, as a country, we were not as commercially aware back then as we are now.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions for the witnesses.  They mentioned interactions, spoke about prospective clients interacting with either IDA Ireland or ConnectIreland and referred to a six-month timeframe in that context.  I ask them to define what is meant by interaction.  Does it mean a conversation, a phone call or documented interaction?  Second, was ConnectIreland privy to any information regarding the review mechanism or the roll-over mechanism?  Do the witnesses know what criteria were used in the decision to roll over and continue the contract?  I asked the previous speakers the same question but they did not have that information.  In terms of the review, were there key performance indicator targets that ConnectIreland had to achieve and did that have an impact on the roll-over time period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017032100002#Z00400","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1490094000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point about what it was like to be an emigrant in Australia reminded me of the type of benevolence of which ConnectIreland has been the recipient.  Every year at the All Ireland Hurling and Football Championship finals, the GAA affords us an opportunity to reach the four corners of the world with a video message about getting involved in ConnectIreland.  The GAA became so heavily involved because it is a community benefactor and ConnectIreland is, ultimately, a community organisation, supported by city and county councils across Ireland.<\/p><p>It was also because it had difficulty in fielding football teams at that time and it wanted to reach out to young men and women from Ireland across the world to tell them they could do something too.  One of our ambassadors is M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, who members will be well aware of as he is almost a president of Ireland.  He is more than 90 years of age now and he never travels outside of the country without a box of ConnectIreland brochures under his arm.  He insists on it because he wants to do something useful.  He wants to talk about job creation and the value of our diaspora.  We receive that type of contact and support from a mind-numbing number of people.  I recognise what the Deputy described as it is what we feel and see every day in ConnectIreland.<\/p><p> We welcome the review but we were hoping to be part of the review and that perhaps somebody might ask us what we thought was good about the programme after operating it exclusively from when it began to where it is now.  Certainly, we believe there are areas that can be improved but we would also like to celebrate the success of the initiative.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about the roll-over and key performance indicators.  There was no key performance indicator, as such.  We had what we have now, which is monthly operational meetings.  We are delighted and proud that we have another three announcements today.

When we hear the figure of 957 companies in the pipeline, any of us who knows how the IDA works - and I used to work with the IDA regularly in a previous life - knows there is no way in heaven the IDA will be able to take on that pipeline in any way.  Let us be absolutely honest about that.  I find it very disturbing.  We have all worked collegiately on Brexit and produced a report last week.  I must put on the record that I am absolutely bewildered that the Department could consider letting ConnectIreland lapse in the way it proposed to do so.

I participated in a business talk in Kilkenny, where I live, and said to those present that we should use our contacts around the world.  A lady stood up to say she was a distant relative, going back 120 years, of the Coca-Cola family, who had left Callan, County Kilkenny, and went on to be one of the founding families of Coke.  She still has a distant connection she has never utilised.  She also said to us that within three of miles of where she lives, in Windgap in rural Kilkenny, lived the man who designed the White House, and within six miles of where he in turn lived, the grandfather of Walt Disney lived.  This elderly lady told us of her connections and the connections of those connections in this tiny region of rural Kilkenny, and it just struck me that we really should utilise these connections.<\/p> <p>  There has been much talk of the diaspora for several years.  I proposed my idea to the Taoiseach and he really liked the concept.  I also proposed that I would finance it at the start and get it up and running and that we would be paid back over time as we became successful.  I proposed that it would run as a break-even initiative, which is ultimately the way it is materialising now.  We now have a huge network of educated connectors who know about the project, people all around the world who are eyes and ears for the country and are keeping their eyes and ears open.  If they hear about companies that are expanding, they let us know.  We receive huge numbers of leads every day.  Not all of them convert or turn into jobs for Ireland, but the State does not have to pay in that case.  The State simply pays us a small amount, two and a half times less than the cost of the IDA, for each job we get into the country.  It is a success-only model, so I see absolutely no national advantage in shutting it down.  To answer the Senator's question, I set it up as a patriotic initiative and thought I could get it done.  We had not only a fantastic team led by Ms Murphy, but also a massively loyal network of connectors around the world that we have now built who help the country for nothing.  We give them an opportunity to help the country, and it is as simple as that.<\/p><p>Would I do it again?  Absolutely.  It works.  There are challenges with it so we would like very much to be involved with a review rather than it being this contract whereby we are a direct contractor to IDA Ireland.  It should be a public-private structure whereby one can use the best of the private sector and the innovation of entrepreneurs with the structure and infrastructure of the State organisation to get a job done.  Ultimately, that is what we are doing but there is a lot of opportunity to fix the structure and make it much more successful into the future.<\/p><p> What we would really like is that, as one of the Deputies suggested earlier, rather than closing it down on Sunday, the Department would take it over as a short-term measure and operate it or oversee it until the review is conducted and completed.  Based on the outcome of the review, either the Department would continue running it, IDA Ireland would run it or Enterprise Ireland would do so.  However, somebody would run it or else the Department would deduce at the end that this does not make sense.

There is no doubt one of the great things Ireland has is an extraordinary network of people around the world who feel very passionate and strongly about the country.

That would be very wrong.<\/p> <p>  I sincerely hope the Department will reconsider this situation and I will certainly be talking to the Minister about it.  I am fully aware of the fact that this is very different to the work ConnectIreland does, and that it is a case of no fee, no foal.  It is about providing better value for money in a different sort of way.  It is going for the smaller scale of one to ten, 20 or 30 jobs as opposed to IDA Ireland, which works in the hundreds and thousands.  We want to support IDA Ireland and that is fantastic.  I fully accept the witnesses' point that it is not a case of either-or but, rather, that it is both working in tandem.<\/p> <p>  In Swords yesterday, I visited a home-grown company that started off in 2010 with six people, that now employs 120 and that is going to invest &euro;25 million in order to increase its workforce to 400 over the next three years.

There are hundreds of such companies and we want to support them.<\/p><p>As the Taoiseach once said, if every SME in the country just took on one extra employee we would have 80,000 off the dole immediately.

Every day we are blown away by people, such as the two gentlemen on my right hand side, who have chosen this country.  To reiterate, I do not believe that this is a them-and-us situation.  There is little wrong with this initiative that a few people in a room with a constructive frame of mind could not resolve in a number of hours.  Issues such as verification and red lighting can be resolved.  There is not much wrong with it.  It is okay that there are gaps and that these things did not exist.  The programme is new and, if members will excuse the phrase, one does not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  One figures out where the issues are and resolves them.  That is what ConnectIreland seeks to do, and that is why we did not trigger an arbitration.  We did not want to.  We want to continue on behalf of our network across the globe.

We have built them and we have the dialogue.  The IDA is not structurally able and I assume would not be in a position suddenly to take over 900 other new companies when it is already stretched enough.  Again, the cost of our initiative is pay on success only.
