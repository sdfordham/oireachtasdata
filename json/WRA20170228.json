Tax revenues have grown by over 40%\u00a0from &euro;34 billion in 2011 to &euro;48 billion in 2016.  It is true that new taxes have been introduced but much of the increased revenue is driven by stronger growth and tax buoyancy.  I have said on many occasions that I am cognisant of the high marginal income tax rates\u00a0that apply to many people.  We should be proud to have a highly progressive income tax system, but we must also appreciate the value of retaining the incentive to work, to enable those who work hard to provide for their families and generate further economic growth through increased employment and expenditure in the domestic economy.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a small economy open to trade, open to the exchange of ideas and open to the movement of people.  In order to provide the best opportunities for our citizens we must strive to make Ireland a fair and attractive place for people to live, to work and to build their futures.\u00a0 It is my view that this requires fairness at both ends of the income spectrum reducing the tax burden on lower incomes while also having a top rate of tax that is internationally competitive.<\/p>  <p>  The steady progress I have made in reducing the USC in the last three Budgets, allied to the many other factors at work in rebuilding our economy, is bearing fruit.  When I took office in 2011 the unemployment rate was over 14% and went on to peak at 15.2%. It is now 6.6%.  This is the 17th successive quarter of employment growth and more than 200,000 net jobs have been created since 2011.\u00a0 Employment levels have increased in all regions of Ireland and we've had net inward migration for the past year or so people are coming home.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the feasibility of USC abolition, the forecasts contained in Budget 2017 set out the indicative net fiscal space over the 2018 to 2021 period of some &euro;9.3 billion in cumulative terms.\u00a0 Abolition of the USC over this period would absorb approximately 40% of the currently available net fiscal space.  Furthermore it is my view that the resulting reductions in marginal tax rates would support job creation and economic growth, and better enable us to address the challenges and opportunities arising in the global economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800054#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Investigations","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800054#WRA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[9989\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800054#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has satisfied himself with the Central Bank's response to a bank's placing of 2,141 SME customers into a global restructuring group (details supplied);

The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0\u00a0CCMA is a key part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears framework.\u00a0 It is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act, 1989 and applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the\u00a0State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.\u00a0 Non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The recent Central Bank report on Mortgage Arrears, published on the Department of Finance website on 16 December 2016, found that overall, there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process with regard to mortgage arrears on family homes.\u00a0 I would therefore urge those with mortgage debt to engage with their lender by completing a standard financial statement of their income and expenditure or contact MABS for independent professional and confidential advice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800054#WRA03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Transactions","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800054#WRA03500"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[10008\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800054#WRA03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of the 2010 facility deed between a bank (details supplied) and the Central Bank, which was guaranteed by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":38,"content":"<p>The Bank of Ireland annual report for year ended 2010 provided the following\u00a0details in relation to the\u00a0facility deed:<\/p>  <p>   On 23 December 2010, the Bank entered into a facility deed (the deed) with the Central Bank.

While the\u00a0Review\u00a0\u00a0 indicated that this would come\u00a0via the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, to the value of 35% of the third party motor insurance claims, further discussions are ongoing with industry about options for\u00a0alternative funding arrangements which\u00a0would provide greater\u00a0\u00a0predictability about their financial\u00a0exposure.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the recommendation that the provisions contained in section 78A of the Road Traffic Act 1961, requiring insurers to supply details to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, be amended to provide greater clarity on what is meant by the term \"details\", was implemented by section 30 of the Road Traffic Act 2016.\u00a0 This Act has yet to be commenced.<\/p>  <p>  This report when fully implemented will provide greater certainty in relation to the operation of the insurance compensation framework and it should ensure speedier payments and a simplification of the claims procedure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800055#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[10036\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800055#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to deal with discriminatory practices by motor insurance companies against particular categories of drivers in terms of the setting of premiums; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[10037\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800055#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to deal with discriminatory practices by motor insurance companies against young persons, elderly persons, taxi drivers and those with older cars in terms of the setting of premiums; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":73,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 71 together.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can direct insurers to provide cover to a particular category of drivers at a particular price as this is a matter of a commercial nature and would be contrary to EU rules.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0providing motor insurance, insurers adopt a risk based approach to determining premiums. In simple terms, they look at an application and make a determination of what the likelihood of a claim is and price accordingly.  Their previous claims history will heavily influence their decisions in this area.  Consequently, if a company has had a significant level of claims from a particular age group, then this will be reflected in how they price such a group of people in the future. <\/p>  <p>  Amongst the risk factors insurers look at are the age of the driver, the age of the car and how the car is used, as well as the location of risk, driving history, vehicle details (e.g. engine size), medical conditions, etc.  Using these factors,\u00a0some people will be priced at higher levels because they are considered to represent higher risks.  I do not believe that this can be\u00a0described \u00a0as a discriminatory practice as it simply reflects the nature of how insurance operates.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to taxi drivers, for instance, their time spent on the road makes them a much higher risk for an insurance company compared with a person who drives a short distance to work every day.  This higher risk is also likely to be reflected in an insurer's claims experience, though obviously this will differ from company to company.<\/p>  <p>  However, I do accept that it\u00a0is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the cost of insurance.\u00a0Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  Its\u00a0 Report\u00a0was approved by Cabinet on January 10 2017, and subsequently published.\u00a0It contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation.  Work on implementing\u00a0these recommendations\u00a0is\u00a0under way.<\/p>  <p>  While there is no single simple solution to effect a reduction in the cost of insurance, when taken cumulatively, the implementation of these actions\u00a0 can deliver fairer premiums for consumers including young persons, older persons, taxi drivers and those driving older vehicles without unnecessary delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800055#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800055#WRB03600"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[10039\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800055#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount currently earned in taxation on interest from crowdfunding loans to small and medium enterprises; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that it is not possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy concerning\u00a0the current\u00a0yield to the Exchequer from the taxation of investment earnings from\u00a0crowd-funding loans\u00a0to small and medium enterprises.

NAMA requires that the projected return resulting from the provision of additional funding must be the value maximising strategy for the asset and this is fully in accordance with Section 10 of the NAMA Act.\u00a0 NAMA's actions also must be in line with market norms so as not to create any distortion in the market.  This means NAMA will facilitate the development of only those sites that are commercially viable and where site development will deliver a better recovery than the sale of the undeveloped site and all funding will be provided on market terms.\u00a0 The\u00a0development locations reflect\u00a0key demand and commercial\u00a0viability.\u00a0 In line with its commercial mandate, NAMA will continuously review the\u00a0programme to ensure funding is provided only where this is the value maximising option in line with its commercial mandate.<\/p>  <p>  I am supportive of\u00a0the NAMA Board's decision to\u00a0make\u00a0this very substantial contribution, on a commercial basis, to the increased supply of new homes. \u00a0In fact, my Department's Section 227 review of NAMA published in July 2014 contained a recommendation that NAMA preserve the capacity to consider such a strategy as the commercial logic of such an initiative became clear.<\/p>  <p>  Through this initiative, NAMA will continue to maximise its return to the Irish State and taxpayer,\u00a0currently projected to be in the region of &euro;2.3 bn\u00a0when it completes its work,\u00a0whilst also contributing to increased housing supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800055#WRB04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Ombudsman","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800055#WRB04500"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[9880\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800055#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to resource and equip the Financial Services Ombudsman to the extent that it has the capacity\u00a0to provide a dedicated advice and assistance service to persons to help them articulate their complaint and is a service which person could also refer to in the course of the complaint for further guidance, in view of the fact that the absence of such a service puts many persons with complaints at a substantial disadvantage.","asker":"1259","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p> The Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO) legislation provides for an independent, impartial investigation and resolution of disputes between consumers and financial service providers.

This new model involves considerably more interaction with the parties.  The emphasis is\u00a0on utilising mediation to resolve complaints.  This is a faster and simpler method for resolving disputes and complaints.\u00a0\u00a0 I understand that the FSO\u00a0dispute resolution team also provides information and assistance as required to ensure the consumer is well-informed and best-equipped to engage with the services being offered.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  If these early interventions do not resolve the complaint, parties have the option of having it independently investigated and adjudicated by the FSO and a legally binding finding issued.  This, of necessity, is a more formal and lengthier process.  During this process, the Investigation Service usually\u00a0writes to the Financial Service Provider (FSP) setting out a series of lengthy, detailed and probing questions which are based on the specific issues which the consumer has raised, but goes beyond this by also asking a series of questions about the FSP's conduct in relation to the\u00a0FSO legislation and to their obligations under consumer protection legislation.\u00a0 This assists the articulation of the complaint on behalf of the consumer.<\/p>  <p>  Because the FSO issues findings that are legally binding on the parties, it would be incompatible with fair procedures for the FSO to also provide dedicated advice and assistance to a party to a complaint.

person being an Irish citizen.  In this regard, I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation under the details as provided by the Deputy.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation can only be made after an application is received.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation is available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  The website also contains an on-line naturalisation residency calculator which individuals may find of assistance in establishing if the residency requirements are met.<\/p>  <p>  Following a Referendum of the Irish people, the 27th amendment to the Constitution changed the situation in relation to entitlement to Irish Citizenship.  As a result, Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 was amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004.  The changes came into effect on 1st January 2005.  As of that date a person born in the island of Ireland is not entitled to be an Irish citizen, unless that person's parents have been lawfully resident in the island of Ireland for a total of three years during the four years preceding that person's birth.  Periods of unlawful residence, periods of residence which were for the sole purpose of having an application for refugee status determined or periods of residence where permission was granted for the purposes of study are excluded from the determination of periods of reckonable residence.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child born in the State did not at birth have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, the parent or guardian or person who is in loco parentis to the child may lodge an application for naturalisation on behalf of the child if and when the conditions for naturalisation are satisfied, including a requirement to have a total of 5 years' reckonable residence in the State.  This ensures that, even where a child born in the State did not have an entitlement to Irish citizenship, there is a path to obtaining Irish citizenship through naturalisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800057#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Resettlement Programme","counter":147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800057#WRC01000"},{"type":"question","counter":148,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[9576\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800057#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to terminate the Irish refugee protection programme once the September 2015 commitment to take 4,000 persons has been met.","asker":"1294","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision on 10 September 2015 as a direct response to the migration crisis that had developed on the southern shores of the European Union.  Under this Decision a programme office was established in my Department to oversee the operational aspects of the programme, which aims to bring in 4,000 vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees to Ireland under two different mechanisms, refugee resettlement - operated by the Office for Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI) - and asylum seeker relocation from within the EU.<\/p>  <p>  We will be 100% ahead of target numbers on the Resettlement Programme by next September, due to our commitment to accept an additional 520 programme refugees from Lebanon this year.  While there have been challenges at EU level to maximise the functioning of the Relocation aspect of the programme, following my visit to Greece last December, I am satisfied that the numbers coming in under relocation will scale up to agreed levels this year.  My emphasis currently is to increase the number of people arriving in Ireland under the mechanisms currently in place.  I am satisfied that we are making that progress now to ensure many more people can come to Ireland under our resettlement and relocation programmes.  Our attention is focused on meeting these targets and the needs of those accepted under the programmes on arrival.

This Audit covered the period 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2016 and includes the statistics currently available on the Garda website (www.garda.ie) and it is anticipated that this National Audit will conclude in the second quarter of 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have also assured me that no issues stem from this audit with regard to the performance of MAT checkpoints or prosecutions emanating therefrom.<\/p>  <p>  The Road Traffic Act 2016 (the 2016 Act) was enacted on 27 December 2016 but has not yet been commenced.  The Deputy will be aware that road traffic legislation is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr Shane Ross, T.D.  I am, however, informed that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is working with key stakeholders to introduce the new roadside tests for drugs, which will be known as preliminary drug tests.  It is intended that the provisions will be commenced at the Easter Bank Holiday weekend.  This will allow time for all stakeholders to prepare for introduction, and will provide a valuable opportunity to highlight the dangers of drug driving over the Bank Holiday weekend.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to the introduction of the preliminary drug tests and am confident that these new road traffic enforcement measures will impact positively on road safety.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have no direct role in the enforcement of Road Traffic legislation, including the conduct of MAT checkpoints, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as through a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including driving while intoxicated, as well as speeding and use of a mobile phone.<\/p>  <p>  By working together with the Road Safety Authority and other agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to confront dangerous road-user behaviour through public presence, legislative enforcement, education and partnership.  Both targeted operations and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.<\/p>  <p>  In January, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be an additional 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has an agreed overall vision for the Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This very substantial investment in personnel is driven by our commitment to ensuring that all citizens have the reassurance of a visible, responsive and effective policing service.<\/p>  <p>  At present there are approximately 2,000 civilians in the organisation carrying out senior management, administrative and technical roles.  4,000 civilians will effectively double this figure and represents a medium term target of 20% civilians over the next 5 years.  This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained police men and women are available for and utilised in operational areas.<\/p>  <p>  To support the implementation of this vision, Budget 2017 has provided funding for 800 Garda trainees, 300 Reserves and up to 500 civilians.  The recruitment and appointment of these additional civilians will facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional levels, and also to begin the phased redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front-line policing roles.  These additional resources will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has agreed that the 20% target will be achieved through a twin-track approach: firstly, the identification of Garda&iacute; filling roles that could be done by suitably qualified civilians of whom the Garda Inspectorate has indicated there may be in the region of 1,500, and secondly, the application of a \"civilian by default\" policy.  Under this policy all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, will be filled by civilian staff with the appropriate skills and expertise.  Having regard to the Policing Authority's statutory functions in relation to approving the number and grades of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and making senior appointments, I have requested the Commissioner, in conjunction with the Authority, to prepare a 5 year plan to achieve the 20% target through the rigorous application of these policies.  Work is underway on this plan and I am informed by the Authority that of the 500 civilians to be recruited this year, Garda management has indicated that some 30% will lead to redeployment opportunities which is a very welcome start on a road that has the potential to make a huge contribution to ensuring that we have an effective and efficient police service.<\/p>  <p>  SI 109\/1990 provided that members appointed with special technical qualifications and assigned to serve in particular sections of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under Regulation 14 of SI 164\/1988 (Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988) were not eligible for transfer to any other section or part of the organisation, on promotion or otherwise.  Both of these statutory instruments have been revoked by SI 485\/2006 (Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Promotion) Regulations 2006) and SI 470\/2013 (Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 2013) respectively.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequent regulations continue to provide for appointments of persons with special aptitudes, knowledge, skills or technical qualifications as members in certain circumstances without compliance with all of the normal provisions applicable to trainee Garda&iacute;.  Such appointments are rare and in the past would have included, for example, persons with ICT expertise.  Such expertise is now secured through recruiting civilian staff.  Obviously there is no intention that members appointed under any of the above regulations and who do not have the necessary training and skills for front-line policing would be redeployed.  Where appropriate, any such posts which do not require policing powers and could be filled by suitably qualified civilians will be filled in the future using the \"civilian by default\" policy at such a time as the posts become vacant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800057#WRC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800057#WRC03100"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[9571\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800057#WRC03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on a matter (details supplied) regarding a visa appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the appeal referred to was received by the Visa Office in Abu Dhabi and is now awaiting examination by the Visa Appeals Officer.<\/p>  <p>  The documentation submitted with the original application and any additional documentation provided with the appeal will be considered.

It was chaired by then Senator Martin McAleese and it is commonly referred to as the McAleese report.  The material in the Report relates to 10 different institutions which were run by 4 different Orders of nuns over a period of 70 years.  Although there was no finding in the McAleese Report which indicated that the State had any liability in the matter, following the report&rsquo;s publication the Taoiseach issued a State apology to the women.<\/p><p>Mr. Justice Quirke was asked by the Government to make recommendations on an appropriate redress scheme for those who were in the 10 Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese Report.  The Government also included in the scheme the laundry that was attached to Stanhope Street Training School and later also decided to include a 12th institution, the Training School in Summerhill.<\/p><p>The Scheme provides for lump sum payments varying from &euro;11,500 to &euro;100,000 depending on the length of stay in the institution concerned.  Further, each woman is entitled to a top-up payment to bring her weekly income from the Irish State up to the equivalent of the Irish Contributory Pension.<\/p><p>To date 819 applications have been received by my Department all of which have been processed.  No application was refused due to inaccurate or missing records.  However, 101 applications were refused because the applicants were not resident in a relevant institution.  <\/p><p>If there is a discrepancy, or in cases where the religious congregations have an incomplete or no record for an applicant, my officials carry out a thorough examination, checking whatever records are available from other departments, agencies and institutions to support the application.  The records of the religious congregations are not regarded as decisive; they are just one factor that is taken into consideration.  Interviews were conducted with 70 applicants for whom the religious congregations concerned did not have records and of those 70 applicants, 2  were refused entry to the scheme.<\/p><p>Over &euro;25 million has been paid out to 669 women under the Scheme, of whom 118 qualified for the maximum lump sum payable under the scheme.  In addition there are a further 17 applicants who also qualify for the maximum payment but have not yet been paid.  Of these 17 applicants, 9 are deemed to lack  capacity but will be paid following the commencement of the Assisted Decision Making legislation.  The remaining 8 applicants who qualified for the maximum payment are deceased and payments will issue to their estate once a Grant of Probate issues.  The Deputy will be aware that Judge Quirke recommended that where an applicant was deceased before a payment issued that the maximum amount payable to her estate should be &euro;50,000.  <\/p><p>Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking into account any available records, documents and statements including the applicant's testimony.  Processing of all applications under the Scheme operates on the premise that the testimony of the applicant is correct and the officers processing the application then seek to verify the application by checking appropriate records.  If there are records and they are consistent with the application, then an offer is made.  It should be noted that the majority of applicants who were resident in the 10 Magdalen institutions fall into this category. <\/p><p>In relation to the question concerning applicants accepting lesser awards than were claimed, it should be noted that the award is determined solely by the proven length of time spent in the institution concerned.  In some instances an applicant may believe that they spent a longer period of time in an institution than the available records support.  Usually, when an applicant is shown all the available records, which include religious, primary school, employment records and and so on, they are satisfied, given the lapse of time involved, that the available records provide a more accurate account of the length of stay in the institution.  The exact number of applications that category is unavailable but I am informed that the number is not significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800058#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Staff","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800059#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[9748\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800059#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the current and potential future delays in probate registration in County Mayo as a result of the non-replacement of the recently retired probate officer; the plans of the Courts Service for this position; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Probate Office is an office of the High Court and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.

As the Deputy will be aware, the allocation of judicial resources and the scheduling of court cases is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the judiciary who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The President of the Circuit Court has been very helpful as regards consideration of dedicated new court arrangements for repossessions and the option and implications of the use of pre-existing legislative powers to implement a system of specific court sittings  for repossessions at specific venues on specific dates.  This is being pursued at present between my Department and the Courts with a view to possible new arrangements for the Easter law term where appropriate and having regard to constitutional constraints. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the Government, at its meeting of 6 December 2016, decided to reassign, by appointment, three specialist judges of the Circuit Court as ordinary judges of the Circuit Court to fill three existing vacancies and so there are currently no vacancies in the Circuit Court.  The Department is actively involved in discussions, including with the judiciary and Courts Service, as regards what progress can be made on introducing the proposed dedicated arrangements for mortgage arrears cases which I hope to bring to Government for consideration in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of the commitments in the Programme for Government is, as the Deputy will also be aware, putting in place a national mortgage arrears resolution service and priority was given last year to getting the new national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service (Abhaile) up and running.  The service, which forms part of the Programme for Partnership Government commitments on mortgage arrears, ensures that people who are at risk of losing their home have access to free independent financial and legal advice and assistance.  The objective is to help these homeowners to identify and put in place solutions to their mortgage arrears, with priority to helping them remain in their home wherever possible. <\/p>  <p>  On 27 February 2017 a new national information campaign went live, designed to reach out to homeowners in mortgage arrears and further raise awareness of the highly effective Abhaile service.  This information campaign wants to ensure that everyone who needs assistance and may be at risk of losing their home is aware that free advice and support is available through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) helpline and MABS offices across the country.  Homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears, including those facing repossession proceedings, can contact MABS which will provide support and advice.  Support available includes in-house dedicated Mortgage Arrears advisers in MABS offices across the country, specifically to assist and negotiate with financial institutions on the borrower's behalf. <\/p>  <p>  MABS can also provide access to free independent financial advice and assistance on personal insolvency and bankruptcy from a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP), and to free independent legal advice from a solicitor, under a 'voucher' system.  The advice and assistance is provided by a PIP or solicitor from expert panels, established under the Scheme respectively by the Insolvency Service of Ireland and by the Legal Aid Board.  The service also includes free support and assistance at Circuit Court repossession court lists country-wide, with MABS court mentors in attendance to provide help and advice to borrowers attending, and a 'duty solicitor', from a Legal Aid Board panel, to provide legal assistance in court to unrepresented borrowers in repossession proceedings.  The scheme also offers legal aid to borrowers seeking the new Personal Insolvency court review under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015.  To date some 4,800 individual vouchers have been provided under under Abhaile for free financial or legal advice and assistance on home mortgage arrears since 22 July 2016. <\/p>  <p>  A further key element relates to the power of a court to impose mortgage arrears solutions for those in arrears and it is critical to note that use of the key statutory provision allowing for imposition of debt solutions involving a mortgage, where the solution has been rejected by the creditors, is increasing due to the availability of the Abhaile service since last October.  I am referring to the \"section 115A\" procedure put in place under the 2015 Personal Insolvency legislation which allows the Circuit Court, in defined circumstances, to impose a personal insolvency arrangement (PIA), on application from the debtor, where the proposed arrangement has been rejected by the creditors.   <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to point out to the Deputy that early indications, while based on small initial samples, suggest that the new Abhaile service is reaching those most at risk of losing their homes, and particularly the cohort of those who are in mortgage arrears equivalent to 720 days or more.  They also suggest that access to free, independent expert help, and to statutory protection against creditor pressure for those who are engaging, is a significant relief for those at risk, and that independent advice is identifying solutions which offer better outcomes for the homeowner, often enabling them to remain in their homes.  Representative outcome data for the Abhaile Service is not yet available, but this information is being tracked and collected and full analysis will be available at a later date.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Department of Social Protection, leads both operational oversight and governance steering groups for the new Abhaile service and its effectiveness and impacts are being closely monitored as part of these processes.  Furthermore, my Department continues to pursue the remaining aspects of the Programme for Government commitment, including the identification of any necessary legislation, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, bearing in mind constitutional and legal aspects, with a view to further implementation measures in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800059#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":225,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[9783\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800059#WRF01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the the courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":226,"content":"<p>Work on the preparation of the General Scheme of a Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is at an advanced stage at my Department.

The Courts Service has informed me that the total expenditure to date exclusively on the Irish sentencing project is &euro;397,060.

This commitment follows on from the recommendation of the Penal Policy Review Group that a programme similar to the existing Diversion Programme for persons under eighteen years of age, be introduced for young people above the age of eighteen years, with an initial focus on eighteen to twenty one year olds.  The Review Group recommended that the relevant Departments and agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, should immediately consult in relation to the most appropriate and effective means of targeting this group within the context of current and future resources.<\/p>  <p>  The Review Group did acknowledge that a Diversion Programme for eighteen to twenty one year olds would have resource implications for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  They also recognised that a greater focus on young offenders in this age cohort \"would require a level of consultation and cooperation between Departments and agencies, as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, comparable to the existing Diversion Programme\".  Importantly, the Review Group went on to say that \"undoubtedly this would require a level of commitment in terms of resources, finances and cooperation that is undetermined\".<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Irish Youth Justice Service continues to engage with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the recommendation with a view to scoping out the detailed implications of introducing a Diversion Programme for young offenders over eighteen years of age, focusing in the first instance on offenders aged eighteen to twenty one years.  This requires a detailed analysis of the nature and scale of offending by the age cohort concerned in recent years.  This is necessary so that there is clarity in relation to the potential numbers that might be amenable to diversion should such a programme be established and operated on the same basis as the existing Programme.  It is also essential to establish the potential resource implications for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in terms of the number of additional Juvenile Liaison Officers that might be required and the additional workload that would fall to the Director of the Diversion Programme and the Garda Youth Diversion Office.  There would also be the potential implications for the Irish Youth Justice Service to be considered should that office's remit be extended, not least in terms of the management and oversight of likely additional expenditure to expand the current network of Garda Youth Diversion Projects to support the operation of a Diversion Programme for the age cohort involved.<\/p>  <p>  As previously indicated, consideration must also be given to the outcome of the ongoing comprehensive review of the existing Diversion Programme which is being undertaken by a Group established by the Garda Commissioner.  The outcome of that review will likely inform considerations relating to the establishment of a similar programme for young offenders over eighteen years of age.  Other considerations could include how effective such approaches are in other jurisdictions where this age cohort is concerned.  <\/p>  <p>The Deputy will therefore appreciate that while progress is being made in relation to the questions raised, the implications of introducing a diversion strategy for the age cohort concerned requires detailed and careful consideration so that there is full appreciation of its likely impact, both in terms of its effectiveness and on the agencies concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800059#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[9904\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800060#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the way in which her Department has upheld its role within goal 5 of the national policy framework for children and young people 2014&ndash;2020 in supporting effective transitions.","asker":"1280","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is probably aware, Transformational Goal 5 of 'Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, the national policy framework for children and young people 2014 - 2020', is concerned with supporting effective transitions.

The Department's role in this regard could arise in circumstances where children and young people are being released from detention in the Children Detention Campus in Oberstown and who become subject to Probation Service supervision after their release.

The Irish Prison Service Strategic Plan sets out the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to strengthen family supports to facilitate on-going contact with prisoners while in custody and their reintegration post release, with appropriate supports and programmes. <\/p>  <p>  The Director General of the Irish Prison Service established the Families and Imprisonment Group, and tasked the group with examining existing visiting facilities for all prisoners and in particular to address the needs of children and families as highlighted in the report published by the Irish Penal Reform Trust titled \"Picking up the Pieces: The Rights and Needs of Children and Families Affected by Imprisonment\".<\/p>  <p>  The Families and Imprisonment Implementation Group is currently overseeing the delivery of the actions identified and is chaired by Governor Pat Dawson and includes representatives from the Childhood Development Initiative, the Psychology Service, the Probation Service, the Prison Officer's Association and Tusla.  A key goal is to establish a model of through-care to parents returning to the community in partnership with Tusla and other community based organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Following a period of consultation with a range of non-government organisations, the Irish Prison Service forged a partnership with the Childhood Development Initiative and the Parents Plus Charity to introduce a dedicated family and imprisonment programme on a pilot basis called 'Family Links' which commenced in Limerick Prison in September 2014 with the aim to improve the visiting experience for families, improve staff awareness of the effects of imprisonment on families, and to support the family unit with the introduction of a parenting programme. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this initiative, Limerick Prison has radically changed the design for visits in the C Block.  The visiting room now consists of eight round tables with four chairs around each in a warm and colourful environment.  Prisoners on standard regime have access to this style of visit.  Limerick Prison has also established a &lsquo;family room&rsquo; which is available to prisoners on an enhanced regime. <\/p>  <p>  Limerick Prison has worked closely with the Irish Prison Service Training College and the Childhood Development Initiative in developing and delivering a number of learning and development programmes.  Training have been delivered to over 40 staff to include: (1) 'Front-of-House' training to improve customer service, and increase awareness of the challenges faced by families with a loved one in custody; (2) Family Liaison Officer training to support the prisoners in their role as parents and to co-deliver the 'Parents Plus' parenting course to prisoners; and, (3) Children First awareness training.  <\/p>  <p>  The Parents Plus Charity and Childhood Development Initiative have worked with the Irish Prison Service to tailor the &lsquo;Parents Plus&rsquo; parenting programme to meet the need of parents in prison.  Family Liaison Officers in Limerick Prison facilitate parenting skills course for prisoners, and &lsquo;Bedford Row&rsquo; charity works simultaneously to deliver the parenting programme in the community.  This programme has been successfully delivered to 24 prisoners. <\/p>  <p>  The University of Limerick was commissioned to undertake an independent evaluation of the Limerick pilot, utilising both qualitative and quantitative methods.  <\/p>  <p>  I had the pleasure of launching the evaluation of the  Family Links Programme on Monday 13th February, 2017 at an event in my Department.  At the launch, I stated that &ldquo;by improving and supporting family relationships, we can not only reduce tension and family conflict but very importantly, minimise the numbers of offenders returning to prison, which is to everybody&rsquo;s benefit&rdquo;.   <\/p>  <p>  Governor Pat Dawson who chaired the Irish Prison Service Families and Imprisonment Group stated at the launch that the Family Links Programme was implemented with the support of Childhood Development Initiative (CDI) to develop models of best practise to be implemented in Irish prisons.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme is currently being extended to both Midlands and Wheatfield Prisons and  includes family related courses and programmes, staff training and support, community follow-up and partnership, communications and enhanced visiting facilities.<\/p>  <p>  Further small capital projects are underway to enhance visit facilities across the prison estate.

In order to achieve this aim the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service have a multi-agency approach involving considerable resources devoted to offender management and rehabilitation from pre to post-imprisonment in order to support planned re-integration, reduce re-offending and improve prisoner outcomes.  <\/p>  <p>  Where the Courts have ordered the post-release supervision of offenders on completion of sentence, or in the case of life-sentenced prisoners released on reviewable conditional release by the Irish Prison Service, prison-based Probation Officers complete appropriate risk assessments to inform future case management.  This case management is undertaken by Probation Officers in the community for the duration of the specified community sanction. <\/p>  <p>  In addition the Prison Service provide a range of services to prisoners to enhance their chance of successful reintegration. <\/p>  <p>  The Integrated Sentence Management process is  a prisoner centred, multi-disciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress. <\/p>  <p>  A primary function of the Psychology Service in prisons is to assist offenders address factors that place them at risk of re-offending including emotional regulation, mental health, substance abuse, sexual and violent offending.  Where deemed clinically appropriate, the Psychology Service provides support to those who have been engaged with the Service who are transitioning between prison and community.     <\/p>  <p>  The guiding principle which underpins the Prison Education Service and the Prison Work and Training Service is to make available work, work-training, education and other purposeful activities to assist offenders cope with their sentence, achieve personal development and prepare for life after release. <\/p>  <p>  The Chaplaincy Service provides pastoral and spiritual care to any prisoners who wish to avail of the service.  The Irish Prison Service provides funding to the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders (IASIO) for two operational services, the 'Gate' Service and the Resettlement Service. <\/p>  <p>  The 'Gaining Access to Training and Employment' (GATE) Service is a vocational service that offers guidance counselling and placement supports to referred prisoners with the overall aim of securing a placement in training, further education or employment post-release.  The Resettlement Service is a primary needs resettlement support service for prisoners with less than 18 months left to serve.  The Resettlement Service provides one-to-one support from the prison to the community.  Since 2007, the Irish Prison Service has engaged Merchant's Quay Ireland to develop and deliver an effective prison-based Addiction Counselling Service. <\/p>  <p>  Local review meetings are held in prisons on a regular basis where a prisoner&rsquo;s sentence progression is discussed.  They are chaired by the Governor with the attendance of all members of the prison-based multi-disciplinary team.  Elements of these review discussions include the risk of re-offending on release, risk of homelessness on release, and proposed supports pre- and post-release in the case of prisoners being assessed for early release.<\/p>  <p>  The Community Return Programme is an incentivised early release scheme co-managed by the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service.  This involves an initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work in a supervised group setting.  In addition a Community Support Scheme has been introduced to reduce recidivism rates of short-term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures post release and by providing for a more structured form of temporary release.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service are actively engaged with senior management in the Department of Social Protection and Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government  with an overall aim of establishing a protocol between Departments for the case management of offenders who are at risk of homelessness in line with Pillar 1 of 'Rebuilding Ireland'.<\/p>  <p>  A new release planning policy for the Irish Prison Service will shortly be put into place and will represent considerable improvements to current pre-release planning and practices in Irish prisons.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. <\/p>  <p>  Blanchardstown Garda District forms part of the DMR West Division. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda strength of the DMR West Division on the 31 January 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 672 and the strength of Blanchardstown District was 309 which includes 27 Community Garda&iacute;.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 76 of whom have been assigned to DMR West, Blanchardstown District.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda District, including the Blanchardstown District in the coming years. <\/p>  <p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will also facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800062#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800062#WRJ00350"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[10240\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800062#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a disclosure can be made by a member of the public regarding the Courts Service of Ireland under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.

This means that 92% of the Report's 173 recommendations are now implemented, partially implemented or are in progress.  This is a significant increase on the 80% reported in the first audit of progress published last June.  I gave a clear commitment last June when Minister Stanton and I published the first audit of progress that the process of implementation would continue.

These improvements are in line with our commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to reform the Direct Provision system.  <\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has also been made in dealing with those in the protection process for the longest time.  When the Working Group examined the figures in 2015 there were 2,695 people in Direct Provision for 3 or more years.  As of 1 January this year, this has been reduced by 55% to 1,204 people.  The number of people in the system for 5 years or more has reduced by 58% from 1,946 to 811.  Only 251 of these are awaiting a final decision on their protection application and the vast majority of these cannot be processed for various reasons such as pending judicial review proceedings.

It is encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation in November 2015, burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend.  The most recent CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q3 of 2016 show a decrease of 31% in burglary for the twelve months ending 30 September 2016 compared to the previous twelve month period.  In fact, Raheny Garda Station, which services the Donaghmede area, recorded a reduction in burglary of 33% in 2015 when compared to the previous year.

I am pleased that these provisions are now available to Garda&iacute; in relation to prosecutions arising from the concentrated drive against crime which is being implemented under Operation Thor, which is supported by very significant investments in Garda resources.  In addition, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act was commenced a year ago and introduced the DNA database, which provides garda&iacute; with investigative links ('hits') between people and unsolved crimes including burglaries.  It is anticipated that this should significantly assist in improving detection rates for burglary over the coming years. <\/p><p>Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

The entire financial services landscape has changed utterly, characterised by the presence of new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.<\/p><p>New European regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes.  The capital requirements' regulation and directive, which came into force in 2014, brought about significant enhancements in the quality and quantity of capital that banks are required to hold and the setting of minimum liquidity requirements. <\/p><p>The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism have transformed the framework for dealing with failing banks and are designed to provide a financial safety net and a means for recovery and resolution with minimum disruption to the sovereign.

Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted.  Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted.

The\u00a0Programme for a Partnership Government, therefore,\u00a0sets out a number of important and practical\u00a0measures which can be taken to improve the position of variable rate mortgage holders.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, it wishes to\u00a0promote competition in the supply of mortgage finance.  To that end,\u00a0the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) will\u00a0work with the Central Bank to set out\u00a0options for\u00a0Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to\u00a0improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to\u00a0section 10(3) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014,\u00a0the CCPC will undertake an exercise which will involve:-<\/p>  <p>  (i) setting out how competition in the mortgage market operates in terms of interest rates and mortgage approval with a focus on outcomes in comparator jurisdictions;<\/p>  <p>  (ii) setting out what consumers want and expect in a properly functioning mortgage market;<\/p>  <p>  (iii) identifying gaps where competition or consumer protection is inadequate, including a survey of potential new entrants (both traditional and non-traditional) on barriers to entry into the Irish mortgage market;<\/p>  <p>  (iv) outlining of options, including their likely\u00a0benefits and costs, to reduce the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve competition and consumer protection in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation.<\/p>  <p>  In liaison with the Central Bank, the CCPC has now commenced this work and this week announced\u00a0a public consultation to gather all views about the future of the Irish mortgage market. The closing date for submissions is 20 March 2017.\u00a0 The CCPC will\u00a0produce a final report outlining\u00a0their proposals by the end of May 2017.  For more information on this please see the following link: www.ccpc.ie\/news\/2017-02-20-future-irelands-mortgage-market-ccpc-opens-public-consultation.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the Government considers that measures to encourage and promote a greater level of switching in the mortgage market would also\u00a0help boost the level of competition in the market for existing mortgages.  In particular, the Programme for Government considers that the development of a code of conduct\u00a0for switching mortgage provider would be a useful and practical initiative\u00a0which would have the potential to deliver savings to many existing mortgage holders.  To that end, the Central Bank has commenced a programme of research on this topic and the Bank has indicated that the output of this work will be used to inform its consideration of the need for any future work in the area of mortgage switching and specifically around the need for a mortgage switching code.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A healthy commercial banking system that is in a position to provide finance to customers and is resilient to economic and financial market shocks, needs to be able to generate sustainable profits over the long term   for example, sufficient profit levels to absorb credit losses over the credit cycle while still generating capital.  In Ireland, the mis-pricing of risks in historical lending continues to be a significant contributor to weak profitability, as evidenced by the continued high level of non-performing loans, prevalence of very low yielding tracker mortgages, and low net interest margins.<\/p>  <p>  It also needs to be\u00a0noted that the residential mortgage market is evolving and that it now comprises, inter alia, fixed interest rate mortgages, loan to value managed variable rate mortgages, trackers and\u00a0restructured mortgages of various types.\u00a0 Therefore, the residential mortgage market cannot be assessed by only looking at standard variable rate mortgages, and any assessment, would need to consider the large number of different factors that influence interest rate pricing.\u00a0 The provision of clear information to consumers on mortgage products is, therefore, very important.\u00a0 The\u00a0Central Bank requires that all mortgages are advertised and sold in accordance with the requirements of financial services legislation (including Central Bank Codes), and that consumers who choose a given mortgage product (or to switch to a new product) are treated in accordance with these requirements in the context of the product they have chosen.\u00a0 Also, the Central Bank has recently made changes to better inform and protect variable rate mortgage holders\u00a0in relation to changes in the mortgage rate.  The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and are effective from 1 February, will require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase.  The measures will also improve the level of information to be provided to borrowers about other mortgage products their lender provides that could provide savings for the borrower and signpost borrowers to the CCPC's mortgage switching tool.  Central Bank\u00a0research has also\u00a0showed that there is\u00a0scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages.<\/p>  <p>  In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition rather than administrative controls is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.\u00a0 This is a policy\u00a0area that the Government will keep under active review in its\u00a0ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments to help deliver on a long term basis better outcomes for all mortgage borrowers.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800063#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800063#WRK01050"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[9678\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800063#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the legal fees incurred on freedom of information, FOI, requests received by his Department; the staff hours involved in the processing of FOI requests for the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The review sets out a series of actions that will make MTR quicker, more transparent and more accessible for borrowers in mortgage distress.\u00a0\u00a0The changes are designed to increase the number of households availing of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The MTR Review also announced the testing of\u00a0alternative funding models for the scheme to deliver volume.\u00a0 The Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a minimum of 200 units based on the new arrangements.\u00a0 The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is to be hoped that the test of the alternative MTR model will be positive and will result in a further scheme to aid as many distressed borrowers as possible to remain in their homes through a leasing arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I must point out that as Minister for Finance, I am unable to intervene directly in the commercial decision-making process of any financial institution, which is a matter for the management\u00a0boards of each institution.\u00a0 Separately, however, I would refer the\u00a0Deputy to the Central Bank Report on Mortgage Arrears, published on my Department's website on\u00a016th December, which noted inter alia that: <\/p>  <p>  -  There is a broad range of available restructures offered and delivered by both bank and non-bank entities depending on the individual circumstances of the borrower;<\/p>  <p>  -  Since the June-2013 peak,\u00a0considerable progress has been made in addressing mortgage arrears primarily through the use of restructures, rather than loss of ownership;<\/p>  <p>  -  The use of a range of restructuring options for distressed borrowers increases the potential for them to remain in the primary residence;<\/p>  <p>  -  Overall, there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Relief Extension","counter":416,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL00750"},{"type":"question","counter":417,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[9844\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the mortgage interest relief will be retained beyond 2017 on a tapered basis, in view of the fact that a substantial number of homeowners are still in negative equity.","asker":"1310","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":418,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that there is a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to retain mortgage interest relief (MIR) beyond the current end date on a tapered basis. \u00a0At\u00a0present,\u00a0Section 244 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, with relief being available until 31 December 2017.\u00a0 Mortgage interest relief was abolished for homes purchased on or after 1 January 2013.  As the legislation currently provides for the relief to continue until the\u00a0end of December 2017, it was not necessary to include legislation in Finance Bill 2016 to provide for the tapered extension of the relief.\u00a0 However in my Budget speech in October last\u00a0I confirmed my intention to extend MIR beyond the current end date on a tapered basis to 2020 and that the details of the extension will be set out in Budget 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Mortgage interest relief operates as a tax relief at source, meaning that the relief is deducted by the bank from the mortgage payment due, and the homeowner pays only the net amount due.  Therefore existing recipients of the relief could face a significant\u00a0increase in their monthly mortgage payments\u00a0when the tax relief at source is withdrawn (all other factors being equal).  The purpose of the proposed tapered extension is to avoid a sudden significant increase in mortgage repayments for those losing the relief, but instead to withdraw the relief gradually, allowing the mortgage holder time to adjust to the change in mortgage repayments.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that, on foot of a change I introduced in Budget 2012, first time buyers who bought at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008 receive a rate of mortgage interest relief of 30%.  This compares favourably to the rates available to other remaining recipients of MIR which reduce on a gradual basis from 25% in years 1 and 2 of the mortgage to 15% in the 8th and subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  Single individuals and\u00a0married couples\/civil partners that are first-time buyers qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven tax years of their mortgage up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively.  Thereafter relief is restricted to\u00a0ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan, when interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment.\u00a0 Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans.  It is worth noting that the application of the annual ceilings on\u00a0interest qualifying for relief, and the\u00a0stepped reduction in the rate of relief available to remaining recipients other than those\u00a0who purchased\u00a0between 2004 and 2008,\u00a0already work to reduce the relief in a gradual manner. <\/p>  <p>  A review of policy considerations and potential costs of\u00a0an extension of mortgage interest relief was contained in the Income Tax Reform Plan published by my Department in July last year and may be of interest to the Deputy.  The plan is available at: www.finance.gov.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/Income%20Tax%20Reform%20Plan-FINAL_0.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the challenges that individuals continue to face notwithstanding the improving economic conditions.  In relation to negative equity, I would point out that the position is improving with the number of primary dwelling home mortgages in negative equity as of December 2015 having\u00a0reduced to 15 per cent, a decline of 5 per cent since December 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Data","counter":419,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL00950"},{"type":"question","counter":420,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[9850\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of local property tax collected in the Fingal County Council area in 2016; the amount of proceeds from the local property tax allocated to Fingal County Council in 2016; the way this money was spent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

It was introduced by the previous Government to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.  The Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm\u00a0that is regulated by the Central Bank.  The significant point is that\u00a0the regulation is focussed at the point of contact with the customer.  Therefore relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation in July 2016.  It is also important to highlight that the transfer of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is now the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of credit servicing firms.  Credit servicing firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including the various codes and Regulations mentioned already and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).<\/p>  <p>  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have:<\/p>  <p>  -  Robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance;<\/p>  <p>  -  Agreements with loan owners that enable the credit servicing firm to fully comply with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Adequate and effective control of loan servicing in the State to enable Central Bank oversight. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  The legislation also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit servicing firm to perform such an action.  Therefore the borrower is protected because the owner cannot give an instruction that would breach the rules but also the instruction cannot be implemented by the regulated credit servicer, over whom the Central Bank has oversight as a regulated entity.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, my Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections\u00a0that they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expects that the Central Bank, as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ireland Strategic Investment Fund Investments","counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL01350"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":192,"qnumall":"[9932\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of funding that has been made available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for social and affordable housing provision; if he is satisfied with the current rates of interest being charged to borrowers through the fund; if he is reviewing the operation of the mechanisms through which credit is accessed from the fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in the social and affordable market, in line with Rebuilding Ireland commitments, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and a number of key Government Departments are examining the feasibility of establishing a funding vehicle, in conjunction with the private sector, which could facilitate investment in social and affordable housing. <\/p>  <p>  Key factors which must be addressed to facilitate ISIF involvement in such projects include: the commercial viability of proposals; Eurostat treatment of fund structures which receive a substantial proportion of their revenue from Government sources; and the ability to create off-balance sheet vehicles outside of the existing PPP model.

This work was undertaken within the whole-of-Government framework established by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  Following the result of the UK referendum and to prepare for the forthcoming negotiations, work has been intensified across the whole of Government including in the Department of Finance.

In addition, the Department\u00a0of Finance staff complement in the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels has been strengthened.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2017, the Department of Finance published the Economic and Fiscal outlook which presented a full macroeconomic projection including updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space, taking account inter alia of the impact of Brexit.  As part of Budget 2017, the Department also published detailed analysis of sectoral exposure to Brexit across the economy. \u00a0Utilising the sectoral exposure analysis, Budget 2017 included a number of measures to respond to the challenges of Brexit, to mitigate future risks, and to support any opportunities that might arise.  These included measures to support SMEs, entrepreneurship, agri-food and Irish exporters.  The Department also worked with the ESRI to deepen the macroeconomic analysis and a report entitled 'Modelling the Medium to Long Term Potential Macroeconomic Impact of Brexit on Ireland' was published in November 2016. \u00a0Updated macroeconomic forecasts will be published by the Department as part of the Stability Programme Update in April 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Important work is also ongoing in relation to financial services.

The levy was charged at 35% of the Deposit Interest Retention Tax\u00a0(DIRT) paid by a financial institution in 2011 and raises approximately &euro;150 million annually for the Exchequer.  In the case of a financial institution where the amount of DIRT in the base year does not exceed &euro;100,000,\u00a0the levy is not payable.<\/p>  <p>  In the budget statement two years ago,\u00a0I announced that I intended to extend the levy for a further five years to 2021.  I indicated that the overall yield from the levy would be maintained at &euro;150 million annually but that I would undertake a review of the DIRT based methodology for calculating the\u00a0levy.<\/p>  <p>  That review, which included a public consultation on the issue, was undertaken by my Department in early 2016.  Following that review, I decided that the DIRT based formula should be retained but that the base year for calculating the levy in 2017 and 2018 would be changed from 2011 to 2015.\u00a0 I have also decided to introduce a rolling two-year series of base years which will introduce a new base year of 2017 for calculating the levy in 2019 and 2020 and a new base year of 2019 for calculating the levy in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the rolling two-year series of base years has a twofold effect.

Secondly, it will help to correct, on an ongoing basis, any anomalies for individual institutions thrown up by prevailing market conditions, such as the interest rate offering, in any one year.<\/p>  <p>  In order to maintain the annual yield from the levy at &euro;150 million, I have to increase the rate at which the levy is\u00a0charged from 35% to 59% for 2017.

Nevertheless, the serious threat that criminal activity of this kind poses to legitimate and compliant businesses, consumers and the Exchequer is recognised, and action against it has accordingly been a priority for Revenue over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has implemented a comprehensive strategy to tackle the illegal fuel trade, including the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls underpinning a rigorous programme of enforcement action and supported by a range of new legislative measures that I brought forward in Finance Acts.  In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom undertook a joint initiative to find a new fiscal marker for use in marked fuels, which was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom from the beginning of April 2015. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in curtailing fuel laundering in Ireland.\u00a0 This view is supported by a significant increase in tax revenues from road diesel over the past three years.\u00a0 I am also advised that Revenue conducted a National Random Sampling Programme in January 2016, with a view to obtaining an updated picture of the extent of the fuel laundering problem.  The programme methodology entailed taking samples of road diesel from a randomly selected group of licensed traders and testing for the presence of the new marker.\u00a0 No evidence of the new fiscal marker was found in any of the samples tested.  This provides very persuasive evidence that the strategy undertaken in recent years has been successful in addressing the laundering problem. <\/p>  <p>  Revenue works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in acting against fuel fraud, and the relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, through cross-border enforcement groups, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of this criminal activity.\u00a0 This work is being supported and facilitated by the setting up earlier this year, in the framework of \"A Fresh Start: the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan\", of a Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue as well as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts. \u00a0Revenue also works in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, the European Anti-Fraud Office and other international bodies and agencies in the ongoing programmes of action at international level to combat the illicit fuel trade.  The Deputy may be interested to note that in an intelligence-led operation in December 2016, Revenue enforcement officers supported by the Garda Regional Support Unit, seized two oil tankers, 20,000 litres of laundered mineral oil, 140 bags of bleaching earth, ancillary equipment associated with oil laundering and cash, bank drafts and cheques in excess of &euro;60,000 in the Castleblayney area.  This is the first oil laundry detected in this jurisdiction since 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The penalties for offences relating to fuel fraud are laid down in section 119 of the Finance Act 2001 and section 102 of the Finance Act 1999.  On conviction following summary prosecution under these provisions, a court may impose a fine of &euro;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both.  Where a person is convicted for an indictable offence, the court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or a fine not exceeding &euro;126,970, or both.  In addition, for an indictable offence under section 119 of the Finance Act 2001, if the value of the fuel concerned in the fraud exceeds &euro;250,000, including duty and taxes, the court may impose a penalty of three times the value of the fuel, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or both.  The current levels of fines were introduced by the Finance Act 2010 and represented significant increases over the previous amounts: for example, the fine on conviction for an indictable offence was increased from &euro;12,695 to an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970.<\/p>  <p>  The Courts decide on the amount of the fine to be imposed in any particular case and, in practice, do not apply fines up to the existing limits.  There are no proposals at present to increase the level of fines available to the courts.  However, the position is kept under review taking account, among other considerations, of the practical experience of the fines imposed under the current provisions.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue's work against fuel laundering has achieved a considerable level of success, and I am assured that action against fuel fraud will continue to be a high priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget Measures","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL03150"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[9941\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800064#WRL03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the preparations for budget 2017; if the upcoming budget will involve at least a 2:1 split between public spending and tax reductions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>I presume the Deputy is referring to the preparations for Budget 2018 which will be presented to Dail Eireann next October. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the annual budgetary process,\u00a0my Department will prepare the 2017 Stability Programme Update in April, updating the\u00a0economic and fiscal outlook.

Preliminary planning has begun for a possible third European Financial Forum early in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  EFF 2017 featured 24 domestic and international speakers which included President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Jin Liqun; Blackrock Vice Chairman, Philipp Hildebrand; and Credit Suisse Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors (and Chair of the British Bankers' Association), Noreen Doyle among others.<\/p>  <p>  Minister of State Murphy launched IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017 the evening before the forum.  The 2017 plan was drafted following extensive engagement with both public and private sector stakeholders through the IFS2020 implementation framework.  The 2017 Action Plan is divided into two sections.  Section one is a contextual piece outlining the development of the Strategy with a strong focus on Brexit while section two\u00a0contains the suite of 40 individual measures to be actioned in 2017 under the IFS2020 strategic priorities, with the Department or agency responsible for each measure, and the timeline for delivery.  A copy of the 2017 Action plan was provided to each attendee of the EFF.<\/p>  <p>  Since his appointment Minister Murphy has undertaken a significant number of overseas visits to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment and launch the IFS Ireland banner brand.  In September 2016 Minister Murphy travelled to Singapore, Shanghai and Tokyo, in October he visited New York and Washington and in January participated at the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong while also visiting Beijing.<\/p>  <p>  Minister of State Murphy will continue to promote Ireland overseas as the perfect European location for financial services investment as the IFS2020 Strategy moves into 2017, with upcoming engagements in London, Brussels and a visit to Asia in May. \u00a0Minister Murphy will of course meet with international IFS firms and promote our financial services offering during his St Patrick's Day visits to Montreal and Toronto.  In addition officials from my department continue to engage with key financial services stakeholders through the IFS2020 framework to ensure continued growth and development of the international financial services sector in Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800066#WRN03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[2781\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800066#WRN03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has raised Ireland's bid to secure the European Banking Authority with his EU counterparts in bilateral meetings.","asker":"1353","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>While I personally have\u00a0not specifically raised this issue in talks, I would point out that  Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy\u00a0along with my officials are using\u00a0every\u00a0opportunity,\u00a0to\u00a0promote Ireland as a location of choice for the European Banking Authority.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We place a strong emphasis on Financial Services as can be seen from the growth and development of this sector both in the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin and other locations in the country.

In his subsequent appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee, the Governor indicated that this is a lower band figure and that it is expected the number of affected cases will be higher. <\/p><p>Based on current progress,\u00a0the Central Bank\u00a0expects that all relevant lenders will have identified and commenced engagement with most impacted customers by mid-2017.  Payment of redress and compensation, processing and consideration of any customer appeals and the Central Bank's own assurance work will continue beyond this point for some lenders. <\/p><p>The Central Bank has set down a robust framework whereby lenders' internal reviews will be overseen by independent third parties.\u00a0 As part of the Examination, the Central Bank has made very clear what it expects of lenders in terms of redress and compensation to impacted customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800067#WRO02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Compliance","counter":559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800067#WRO02500"},{"type":"question","counter":560,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[10250\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800067#WRO02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax that hosts of a company (details supplied) are liable for; and the differences between the tax relief measures available to landlords and the tax relief measures available to these hosts.","asker":"1215","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":561,"content":"<p>Individuals who provide short-term guest accommodation organised through platforms such as the company in question are liable to income tax, USC and PRSI in the normal manner on the profits arising from the provision of such accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  Where the services are provided on an occasional basis, as distinct from in the course of a trade, the income arising is treated as miscellaneous income and expenses incurred directly in the provision of the accommodation, for example the cost of providing meals, light, heat or laundering costs, would be allowed to be deducted in computing the homeowner's taxable profits from that activity.

or<\/p><p>- the transfer relates to any matter or thing to be done in the State.<\/p><p>However, in practice stamp duty is not generally payable on such documentation as the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act (SDCA) 1999 provides for a range of exemptions from the charge.<\/p><p>Prior to 7 December 2006, stamp duty was chargeable on documents securing loans on property situated in the State and any subsequent transfer of such secured loans.  Section 100 of\u00a0Finance Act 2007 terminated this charge for such 'mortgage' documents executed after this date.<\/p><p>Section 85 of the\u00a0SDCA\u00a01999 provides for an exemption from stamp duty on:<\/p><p>- the issue of loan capital or any Government loan;<\/p><p>- the transfer of companies' loan capital;<\/p><p>- the issue or transfer of securities issued by a qualifying company within the meaning of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997;<\/p><p>- the issue, transfer or redemption of loan capital issued by a company to raise finance to acquire, develop or lease aircraft.<\/p><p>Section 86 of the\u00a0SDCA 1999 provides for an exemption on the transfer of loan stock issued by certain State bodies.<\/p><p>Section 90 of the\u00a0SDCA 1999, in dealing with debt factoring arrangements, provides for an exemption on the transfer of a debt, or part of a debt, where such transfer occurs in the ordinary course of the business of the vendor or the purchaser.<\/p><p>Relief from stamp duty is also provided in relation to transfers of property (whether real or intangible) between associated companies (section 79 SDCA 1999) or in relation to the merger of companies where such transfers are effected for bona fide commercial reasons (section 80 SDCA 1999).  Depending on the particular circumstances and the type of company involved, it could happen that some part of the property transferred could relate to loans.<\/p><p>As stamp duty is not generally payable on documentation transferring a loan, the question of &quot;taking proceedings&quot; on this issue does not arise.<\/p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that normally any profit earned from the sale of loans from one entity to another is chargeable to corporation tax as a trading receipt.  This is the position as regards the financial services sector in particular.  Therefore, in general, the sale of a loan does not constitute a disposal of an asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes.

In this regard a lender must examine each case on its individual merits and it must base its assessment on the full circumstances of the borrower, including, inter alia, the borrower's current repayment capacity. In order to determine which options for alternative repayment arrangements are viable in each particular case, a lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements that they offer. The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) also requires lenders to review an alternative repayment arrangement at appropriate intervals for the type and duration of the arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  The CCMA is a key part of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears framework.  It is a statutory code issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act, 1989 and applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the\u00a0State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  The recent Central Bank report on Mortgage Arrears, published on the Department of Finance website on 16th December 2016, found that overall, there is strong evidence that banks and non-banks are looking to exhaust available options before moving into the legal process with regard to mortgage arrears on family homes.

The Programme for a Partnership Government, therefore, sets out a number of important and practical measures which can be taken to improve the position of variable rate mortgage holders.<\/p>  <p>  Although Ireland is in a monetary union with other Euro area Member States, it has to be acknowledged\u00a0that there are many factors, such as differences in\u00a0national legal and housing systems, cultural preferences, language, the proximity of lenders\u00a0to\u00a0borrowers, which will continue to inhibit\u00a0the full integration of the residential mortgage market\u00a0and of mortgage interest rates in the Euro area and the wider EU.  More directly, differences in the\u00a0nature of\u00a0mortgage and other credit markets, credit and market conditions,\u00a0mortgage default\u00a0rates\u00a0and the funding of mortgage credit\u00a0will also impact on the levels of mortgage lending rates between and\u00a0within\u00a0different\u00a0countries.<\/p>  <p>  However, there have been some developments which seek to promote a more harmonised market for\u00a0credit across the EU.  In particular, the 2014 Mortgage Credit Directive, which has now been transposed into Irish law by the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, seeks to develop a more harmonised, efficient and competitive internal market for the provision of residential mortgages to consumer borrowers and this should help to promote the closer integration of EU mortgage markets over time.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the national context, this Government\u00a0is committed to reducing the cost of secured mortgage lending.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, it wishes to\u00a0promote competition in the supply of mortgage finance.  To that end,\u00a0the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) will\u00a0work with the Central Bank to set out\u00a0options for\u00a0Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to\u00a0improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In liaison with the Central Bank, the CCPC has now commenced this work and last\u00a0week announced\u00a0a public consultation to gather\u00a0views about the future of the Irish mortgage market.  The closing date for submissions is 20 March 2017.\u00a0The CCPC will\u00a0produce a final report outlining\u00a0their proposals by the end of May 2017. <\/p>  <p>  In overall terms, the Government is of the opinion that increased competition\u00a0is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole but without giving rise to potentially undesirable consequences for the provision of new mortgage lending.  This is a policy\u00a0area that the Government will keep under active review in its\u00a0ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government commitments to help deliver on a long term basis better outcomes for all mortgage borrowers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800070#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":648,"content":"<p>Question No. 272 answered with Question No. 49.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Industry","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800070#WRR00700"},{"type":"question","counter":650,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[10434\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800070#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the lending institutions are lending to the construction sector with particular reference to the urgent need to offset the housing crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":651,"content":"<p>Over the last number of years, the construction industry, like many parts of the economy, has gone through a period of deleveraging.  According to the Central Bank's Credit, Money and Banking Statistics, outstanding loans have fallen from a peak of over &euro;10.28 billion in December 2007 to &euro;1.14 billion in September 2016.  Although this process of deleveraging continues, the ongoing recovery in construction activity is evident in growth of new lending to Irish construction firms, which increased by 14 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 2016.  Construction-related lending is in addition to that for the purposes of real estate, land and development activities, where total loans outstanding fell from a peak of &euro;106 billion in September 2008 to &euro;17.3 billion in September 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the need for the construction sector to move away from the former 100 per cent debt financing model and instead adopt a more appropriate risk-weighted model of funding, my Department has actively encouraged the development of alternative sources of development finance.  ISIF, under the auspices of the NTMA, continues to explore ways of funding projects that will enhance the supply of housing. Currently Activate Capital, the joint venture between ISIF and KKR, is providing funding on a commercial basis to fund the development and construction of housing. <\/p>  <p>  The availability of development finance alone will not be sufficient to encourage development unless projects are seen as commercially viable.  As part of Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, the Government has set out a comprehensive package of measures designed to address the structural constraints which continue to inhibit the viability of construction.

Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring SME access to finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector. <\/p>  <p>  Government policy is focused on ensuring that all viable SMEs have access to an appropriate supply of credit from a diverse range of bank and non-bank sources.  In this regard the Government has developed a number of initiatives to ensure that the supply of credit in the market is sufficient to meet the existing and future needs of SMEs. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a key objective of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) is to ensure that SMEs can access low cost flexible loans from a variety of sources. The SBCI channels its funds through lending partners known as on-lenders.  The SBCI currently has three bank on-lending partners and five non-bank on-lending partners.  The SBCI has a current funding capacity of &euro;1.05 billion which it makes available to its on-lending partners as demand from SMEs arises.  To the end of September 2016, a total of &euro;458 million has been lent to over 10,600 SMEs and the SBCI has committed a total of &euro;906 million to its eight on-lending partners. In 2017, the SBCI will continue to make significant funding available to SMEs across Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Another recent initiative is the &euro;150 million Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme for Farmers announced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This fund will provide highly flexible, low interest loans to farming SMEs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people. <\/p>  <p>  The Credit Review Office is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.  This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the Credit Review Office and the bank. The Credit Review Office overturns more than 50% of appeals it receives.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector and sees it as the key engine of ongoing economic growth.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department, working with other relevant Departments, Bodies and Agencies, such as the Credit Review Office, will continue to advance policies to ensure the availability of both bank and non-bank credit so as to ensure that viable Irish SMEs have sufficient access to finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800070#WRR01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Charges","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800070#WRR01700"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[10439\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800070#WRR01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he and his Department continue to monitor the levels of bank charges being imposed by various banks; the basis for such charges, nationally and internationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>All credit institutions in Ireland are independent commercial entities.

Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to\u00a0provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  This additional investment will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be\u00a0provided with a total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need\u00a0in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE advised schools that there was no longer a requirement for schools to make applications for special education teaching supports for individual\u00a0pupils with\u00a0special education teaching\u00a0needs, as resources\u00a0would be provided for schools by the\u00a0profiled allocation.<\/p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding year 2016\/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new allocation model for each school.<\/p>  <p>  A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being devised by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS).  This model will take account of the qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. <\/p>  <p>  For the next re profiling of the model, the pupils with newly identified Complex Needs will be included in this revised allocation. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria it is expected that allocations made to school will be\u00a0sufficient to meet both current and future needs as they arise until the next review. <\/p>  <p>  Currently most schools' educational profiles\u00a0remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The model will provide, from this year, additional resources to schools where it is expected that there will be additional needs.  In protecting resources in schools where the profiles indicate that the levels of need are\u00a0lower than are currently provided for some additional capacity is also provided for in those schools.

Variables used in the\u00a0compilation of the\u00a0HP Index include\u00a0those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at .<\/p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.

The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.

The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out our vision for future intervention in the critical area of social inclusion in education policy.\u00a0<\/p><p>A\u00a0key element of DEIS Plan 2017 Plan is the availability of a new identification process for the assessment of schools for inclusion in DEIS using centrally held CSO and DES data.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The key data sources are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas\u00a0which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.\u00a0 Variables used in the\u00a0compilation of the\u00a0HP Index include\u00a0those related to demographic growth, social class composition and labour market situation. \u00a0This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.\u00a0Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at <\/p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.\u00a0 Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.<\/p><p>Schools included in the list published\u00a0by the Department on\u00a013 February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage.\u00a0<\/p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, including the two schools referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.<\/p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie<\/p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13 February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.\u00a0 I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. <\/p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p><p>Once this work\u00a0has been\u00a0completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.<\/p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.\u00a0 Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.\u00a0 The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.\u00a0 If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800073#WRU01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to schools admissions generally, it is my Department's responsibility to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. <\/p>  <p>  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.

The Tribunal recommended that the income of political parties be disclosed and that political donations, apart from those under a modest threshold, be reported. <\/p>  <p>  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, (the 2012 Act), addressed issues that were central to the recommendations on political funding made in the Moriarty Tribunal Report.  The 2012 Act significantly enhanced the openness and transparency of political funding in Ireland and brought into force restrictions on corporate donations and considerable reductions in the maximum amount that a political party or an individual can accept as a political donation.  The donation limit for a political party was reduced from &euro;6,348.69 to &euro;2,500, while for an individual politician or candidate it fell from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.  A limit of &euro;200 was placed on donations in cash.  The threshold for the receipt of anonymous donations was reduced to &euro;100.  The donation threshold amount that gives rise to the requirement to open a political donations account was reduced to &euro;100.  Anonymous indirect donations were banned.  The threshold at which political party donations must be reported and published was reduced from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500. <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 Act also provides for the disclosure and public inspection of the accounts of registered political parties.  In this connection, parties are required to have their accounts audited each year and to submit to the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) an Annual Statement of Accounts and a copy of the auditor&rsquo;s report on the accounts. <\/p>  <p>  These requirements first applied for the year 2015 and in December 2016, SIPO furnished the Political Parties Statement of Accounts Report 2015 to the Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

A breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP, including the number of Rent Supplement Transfer, in each local authority area at 31 December 2016 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>A breakdown of households supported by HAP within each local authority area at end of Q1 2017 will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly after the end of the quarter.<\/p><p>The HAP has been rolled out to local authorities on a statutory phased basis since September 2014.  As HAP is rolled out nationally, it replaces Rent Supplement for households with a long-term housing need.  My Department and the local authorities work together to help get the operation of the scheme embedded within the local authority area in a phased and organised manner. <\/p><p>In the early stages of HAP being made available in a given local authority area, the assessment and support of households presenting without any housing support are prioritised.  Local authorities are advised to ensure that this process is working efficiently and that the scheme is being operated well before beginning the process of Rent Supplement Transfers.  However, Rent Supplement recipients can approach their local authority to enquire about the scheme and to commence the assessment process for social housing support.  The scheme will be made available to all households in the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal County Councils with effect from 1 March 2017. <\/p><p>Following the commencement of the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, HAP is considered to be a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list.  However, acknowledging that households on the waiting list who avail of HAP might have expectations that they would receive a more permanent form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.<\/p><p>The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of their scheme of letting priorities.  The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.  My Department does not gather or hold any information on households seeking a transfer to an alternative social housing support whether they are currently having their housing needs met through HAP, RAS and or any other form of social housing support. <\/p><p>I understand that the majority of HAP households do avail of the option to be placed on a transfer list.  Some 1,450 households have exited the HAP scheme since its statutory commencement in September 2014, including 240 households (at the end of December 2016) that have transferred from the HAP scheme to other forms of social housing support. <\/p><p>A local authority must be satisfied on inspection that any privately rented dwelling, including those supported under HAP, complies with the statutory standards for rented accommodation prescribed under section 18 of the Act of 1992.  The regulations that provide for these standards specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.  Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  Under section 41 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 local authorities are required to commence this inspection process within 8 months of HAP being paid in relation to a particular dwelling if not already inspected within the previous 12 months. <\/p><p>While in the context of policy development, my Department does consider reports of additional rental payments made by tenants supported by HAP, the number of additional payments being made by tenants is not fully known.  Each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit in circumstances where it is necessary, because of local rental market conditions, to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.

It sets out over 80 actions that the Government is taking through new policy, new legislation and innovative Budgetary   measures to achieve that aim. <\/p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of the Action Plan committed to development of a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector and this was delivered, with the publication of the Strategy for the Rental Sector  , which identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.  To address this situation, the Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards most acutely. <\/p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure. Areas of the country satisfying the statutory criteria will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones and rent increases in those areas are generally capped at 4% per annum for a period of 3 years.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin Local Authority areas and in Cork City.  A further 12 Local Electoral Areas were designated as Rent Pressure Zones on 27 January 2017. <\/p>  <p>It is important to note that the latest report referred to in the Questions relates to rent price inflation in the period prior to the introduction of the Rent Predictability measures and the Rent Pressure Zones.  The data in the report underline the need for and the relevance of the Government's measures.   <\/p>  <p>  The provisions limiting rent increases in rent pressure zones apply both at the commencement of a tenancy and at each rent review.  In addition, at the beginning of a tenancy, there is a statutory obligation on a landlord in a rent pressure zone to provide a tenant with details of the rent under the previous tenancy of the dwelling, together with a statement as to how the new rent has been calculated.  The purpose of this provision is to allow a tenant to ensure that their rent complies with the legislation.  The existing prohibition on charging a rent above market rent continues to apply in all areas. <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides that in confirming whether or not the criteria have been met, the information relating to the area concerned must be determined by the information used to compile the RTB Rent Index quarterly report.  Statistics in the report referred to in the Question are based on asking rents for those properties which are advertised on that company's website, as opposed to the RTB figures which are based on rents paid in all registered tenancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800077#WRY03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":957,"content":"<p>Question No. 382 answered with Question No. 356.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":958,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800078#WRZ00300"},{"type":"question","counter":959,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[10161\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800078#WRZ00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department plans to change planning conditions which prevent the rejection of applications in suburban areas of high density buildings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":960,"content":"<p>National planning policy\u00a0strongly supports\u00a0goals relating to avoiding urban sprawl and securing the efficient use of serviced urban land and increased densities, especially in highly accessible inner city areas, where the full range of employment, retail, educational\u00a0and recreational facilities are within walking or cycling\u00a0distance and close to frequent public transport.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a detailed and national level policy approach in relation to\u00a0residential densities in urban areas has already been set out in my Department&rsquo;s Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas, published in May 2009 under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of these\u00a0Guidelines\u00a0is to ensure local authorities bring about high quality and sustainable urban development using their development planning and management functions to deliver:<\/p>  <p>  - quality homes and neighbourhoods;<\/p>  <p>  - places where people want to live, work and raise families; and<\/p>  <p>  - places that work in relation to the provision of infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Guidelines\u00a0set out a broad and accepted policy context for achieving sustainable development by balancing the need to ensure the highest standards of\u00a0residential\u00a0design which encompasses building lay-out, design and heights and the need to ensure efficient use of scarce land and infrastructural resources and the avoidance of urban sprawl.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the\u00a0Guidelines\u00a0outline a range of\u00a0densities\u00a0appropriate to different location types, from lower\u00a0densities\u00a0in the range of 15 to 20 dwellings per hectare at the edges of smaller towns and villages for private site-type developments to\u00a0densities\u00a0in the range of 20 to 40 dwellings per hectare in more central or edge-of-centre sites in smaller towns, through to\u00a0densities\u00a0in the range of a minimum of 50 dwellings per hectare in larger urban areas along public transport corridors.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Guidelines\u00a0also place a heavy emphasis on the importance of public infrastructure, such as public transport, community and sports facilities, as\u00a0densities\u00a0increase towards more central urban locations, and of the development plan process in securing effective sustainable urban development outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  However, the Guidelines do not set out specific policy advice in relation to height of buildings alone, in isolation from broader location, design and layout considerations nor would it be appropriate to do so, given variability in urban contexts and the inappropriateness of a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; height policy for urban areas that can range from small villages to towns and cities and from suburban to city centre settings.  Rather, it is a matter for local authorities to ensure the appropriate application of the Guidelines in their statutory development plan and development management processes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the National Planning Framework will further develop the policy in this area, for example in relation to identifying potential to build up the population and economic vitality of city and town centre areas that in many cases have witnessed a sustained movement of people outwards to suburban and wider settings.<\/p>  <p>  In view of the above, I consider that there is appropriate and sufficient national policy guidance to support good higher density development proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800078#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":961,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800078#WRZ00600"},{"type":"question","counter":962,"qnumday":384,"qnumall":"[10163\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800078#WRZ00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to extend tenants' rights to those persons that rent a room in a person's house; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":963,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[10165\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800078#WRZ00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to legislate to force those persons that rent rooms in a house to register as landlords and ensure that the accommodation they provide is of a minimum physical standard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":964,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 386 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended, regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector.  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an  independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.<\/p>  <p>  The Act applies to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions.  The dwellings to which the Act does not apply are set out in section 3(2) of the Act, and include for example:<\/p>  <p>  - a dwelling that is used wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on a business;<\/p>  <p>  - a dwelling within which the landlord also resides;<\/p>  <p>  - a dwelling the subject of a tenancy the term of which is over 35 years.<\/p>  <p>In these cases the RTB does not have any function in relation to the agreements or arrangements on which they are based.<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where it is unclear as to whether a dwelling is the subject of a tenancy to which the Act applies, the RTB can adjudicate on the question and has done so in the past.  Where it finds that a tenancy is unregistered due to the landlord&rsquo;s wrongful claim that the Act does not apply to the dwelling, the RTB can serve a notice requiring registration and failure to comply is an offence.<\/p>  <p>  Where the owner of a dwelling, residing in that dwelling, lets a room, that letting is not considered to be a tenancy within the meaning of the Residential Tenancies Act.

As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.  <\/p>  <p>  The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA services has helped over 3,000 such borrowers.  People seeking to access help under the DMA MABS service do not require a voucher to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS has established a national network of court mentors.  The mentors attend each listed repossession Court hearing nationwide and provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signposting them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,600 borrowers have been referred to MABS services through the court mentor service.  Borrowers do not require a voucher to access this service.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2016, an additional initiative was announced by Government.  The scheme, known as Abhaile, further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.  The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to defined levels of independent expert financial and\/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  Qualification for help under the scheme is based on the being (a) in mortgage arrears on their home; (b) insolvent; (c) at risk of losing their home because of their mortgage arrears; and (d) reasonably accommodated.<\/p>  <p>  The new services are provided by professionals drawn from one or more panels of solicitors, personal insolvency practitioners or accountants.  Professional panels consisting of qualified and regulated solicitors and personal insolvency practitioners are already in place, and an expert panel of accountants is expected to be in place by end Quarter 1, 2017 to provide specialist financial advice, where required. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme has been in operation since 22 July 2016 and was formally launched on 3 October 2016.

","asker":"1222","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1028,"content":"<p>The overall concern in recent years has been to protect the value of weekly social welfare rates.  Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion each year, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2017, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing by approximately &euro;200m year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.<\/p>  <p>  There are three main pensions paid by my Department to people aged 66 and over, namely the State pension contributory (which is based on PRSI contributions), the State pension non-contributory (which is based on means), and the Widows\/Widowers\/Surviving Civil Partners Contributory pension (which is based on PRSI contributions, and is also payable at a lower rate before 66).<\/p>  <p>  The State pension contributory (previously called the Old Age Contributory Pension) was introduced in 1961, and is funded by PRSI contributions, on a pay-as-you go basis.  Since its introduction, the rate of payment has been based on the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; test.<\/p>  <p>  These rates are banded, and those bands have been amended from time to time, most recently in 2012.  There have been no changes in the structure of the bands since then, aside from increases in the rates, which are passed on pro-rata to the reduced rates.<\/p>  <p>  As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  This resulted in one of the bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions) being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of reverting to the rate-bands which existed between 2000 and 2012 would be over &euro;50 million in 2017, if introduced from January 2017, and that this annual cost would rise at a rate of some &euro;10 million each year.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to these changes, in the period from 2000-2012, someone with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and this was regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  Aside from the lack of equity involved, this was a significant disincentive to longer working, as in most cases, contributions paid by people in their sixties had no impact upon the rate of their State pension upon retirement.<\/p>  <p>  Given the requirement to make savings in recent years, it was considered more equitable to address this disparity, than to reduce the rate of payment for all pensioners by an across the board cut in payment rates.  Such a cut would have reduced the incomes of the most vulnerable pensioners, who do not receive such reduced rate contributory pensions, but rather receive a maximum rate non-contributory pension, or a maximum rate contributory pension if they have the required contributions.<\/p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a full rate State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory) which has a maximum personal rate of &euro;222, or just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if a person&rsquo;s spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;209, which is just less than 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).  The latter payment is made directly to them, and is based upon their own means, and not their household means.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800079#WRAA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1029,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800079#WRAA04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1030,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[9639\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800079#WRAA04200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if pension scheme members, including current employee members, deferred members and pensioners in payment, are entitled to receive an annual report on the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1031,"content":"<p>S.I.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age. This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p><p>In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  <\/p><p>Reversing this measure would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension. However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time.<\/p><p>Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.<\/p><p>The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.

Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits.<\/p>  <p>  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This annual figure would increase in subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800080#WRBB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes Data","counter":1073,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800080#WRBB02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1074,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[9806\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800080#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of increasing all working age payments by &euro;3, &euro;4, &euro;5, &euro;6, &euro;7, &euro;8, &euro;9 and &euro;10, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":1075,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[9807\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800080#WRBB03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated full year cost of increasing child benefit by &euro;3, &euro;4, &euro;5, &euro;6, &euro;7, &euro;8, &euro;9 and &euro;10, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1076,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 423 and 424 together.<\/p><p>The full year costs of increasing all weekly working age payments by the amounts specified by the Deputy are listed in the following table:<table><tr><th>Increase all working age weekly payments by: <\/th><th>Full Year Cost <br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;3.00<\/td><td>120.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;4.00<\/td><td>160.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;5.00<\/td><td>200.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;6.00<\/td><td>240.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;7.00<\/td><td>279.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;8.00<\/td><td>320.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;9.00<\/td><td>360.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;10.00<\/td><td>399.9<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>It should be noted that the costings listed above include proportionate increases for qualified adults and for those on reduced rates of payment, where relevant.<\/p><p>The full year costs of increasing child benefit by the amounts specified by the Deputy are listed in the following table:<table><tr><th>Increase child benefit monthly payment by: <\/th><th>Full Year Cost <br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;3.00<\/td><td>43.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;4.00<\/td><td>58.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;5.00<\/td><td>73.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;6.00<\/td><td>87.9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;7.00<\/td><td>102.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;8.00<\/td><td>117.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;9.00<\/td><td>131.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;10.00<\/td><td>146.5<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>It should be noted that these costings are subject to change over the coming months in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800080#WRBB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Data","counter":1078,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800081#WRCC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1079,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[9808\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800081#WRCC00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the estimated full year cost of increasing the weekly direct provision allowance for adults from &euro;19.10 to &euro;25, &euro;30, &euro;35 and &euro;40; the cost of increasing the allowance paid in respect of children from &euro;15.60 to &euro;20, &euro;25 and &euro;30 in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1080,"content":"<p>The direct provision allowance is a non-statutory payment administered by my Department on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality to persons in the Direct Provision system.

The service is delivered by two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua.<\/p><p>To date, 78,000 people have started their engagement period with the service.<\/p><p>The service was rolled out on a phased basis over the period mid-2015 to July 2016, as a result the first groups of participants have only recently completed their engagement period with the service. <\/p><p>It is important to note that jobseekers may be supported through the service for up to 30 months - under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases Jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service.  It will take time therefore to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period with the service) for complete and robust outcome data to be available.<\/p><p>However from 2017, the Department will publish a report on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis, with the first such report having just been published recently (17th of January).<\/p><p>The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging.  Employment outcome data shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were 23% more likely to have started a job  (as of October 2016).  The difference appears to be more marked for very long-term unemployed people, with those out of work for more than three years some 44% more likely to have found a job if they engaged with the service.<\/p><p>Given that only a small number of people have completed their full engagement period with the service these results can only be treated as indicative, nevertheless they are encouraging. <\/p><p>As the number of people who have completed their engagement period with the service increases the department will be in a position to provide greater granularity in the reports to be published each quarter this year.<\/p><p>The first report (with results together with a copy of the independent customer satisfaction survey findings for both companies) is available on the department&rsquo;s website at &ndash;.<\/p><p>The service is being delivered through a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies.

Job sustainment fees are payable only for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. 4 payments).  The Department was careful in designing the service to ensure that payments to contractors are conditional on people not just finding a job, but finding sustainable employment.

The companies contracted to provide the JobPath service have no role or authority in relation to referrals or placements for any other activation schemes or programmes such as CE or T&Uacute;S. <\/p><p>Jobseekers who are already participating on a CE Scheme will not be referred to JobPath and the JobPath companies do not refer jobseekers to CE.Jobseekers can only participate with one activation scheme or service at a time; this is to ensure that the best use is made of the available places and to allow the scheme and service providers time to work with the participants.  However, customers who on the date of their referral to JobPath have a written offer with a start date within four weeks for CE or T&Uacute;S will be facilitated to take up the placement.  Additionally, in a small number of exceptional cases, which are assessed on a case by case basis, my Department may facilitate a customer to move from one activation support to another. <\/p><p>The aim of the JobPath service, which is provided for jobseekers only, is to assist them in finding sustainable full-time paid employment by providing intensive individual support and assistance.  It is distinct from the CE and T&Uacute;S schemes which provide part-time employment and training opportunities in local communities as a stepping stone back to employment for people on a range of Social Welfare payments including those on long term unemployment payments.  These schemes do not, nor are they intended to, provide full-time sustainable employment.<\/p><p>The referral period for the JobPath service is typically for a year.  The JobPath service was rolled out on a phased basis over the period June 2015 to July 2016; as a result the first groups of participants have only recently completed their engagement period with the service.  The numbers referred initially were low but this will increase over the next few months and those who have not found suitable and sustainable employment and exited the Job Path service will have opportunities, subject to an assessment by an Intreo case officer to apply for other activation supports such as CE and T&Uacute;S.<\/p><p>It is important to note, that under the JobPath service, jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  The first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  It will take time therefore to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period) for complete and robust outcomes data to be available.<\/p><p>From 2017 onwards, my Department will publish a report on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis, with the first such report having just been published recently (17th of January).<\/p><p>The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging.  Employment outcome data shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were 23% more likely to have started a job (as of October 2016).  The difference appears to be more marked for very long-term unemployed customers, with those out of work for more than three years some 44% more likely to have found a job if they engaged with the service.  These outcomes refer to full time jobs (over 30 hours per week) only. <\/p><p>Given that only a small number of customers have completed their full engagement period with the service these results can only be treated as indicative, nevertheless they are encouraging. <\/p><p>As the number of customers who have completed their engagement period with the service increases the department will be in a position to provide greater granularity in the reports to be published each quarter this year.<\/p><p>The first report (with results together with a copy of the independent customer satisfaction survey findings for both companies) is available on the department&rsquo;s website at &ndash; <\/p><p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies.  The companies are paid registration fees and job sustainment fees.  A registration fee may be claimed only when a jobseeker has developed a personal progression plan.  Job sustainment fees are payable for each 13 week period of sustained employment, up to a maximum of 52 weeks (i.e. 4 payments).

The UN has estimated that 100,000 people are facing starvation, with a further one million people on the brink of famine.  Three UN agencies have also warned that urgent action is needed to prevent more people from dying of hunger.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided &euro;39 million in humanitarian assistance for South Sudan since 2012.  Our assistance is focused on saving lives and alleviating the suffering of the South Sudanese people through meeting their immediate and most basic needs, providing food and livelihoods assistance, treating acute malnutrition, providing shelter and enhancing their protection.  In 2016 alone, Ireland contributed just over &euro;11 million to South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  In view of the rapidly deteriorating situation this year, we have released &euro;265,000 for South Sudanese refugees in the Democratic Republic of Congo and for internally displaced persons in South Sudan.  Further assistance is now being planned to support the humanitarian and emergency response operations of our UN and NGO partners on the ground. <\/p>  <p>  The concern is shared strongly at EU level.  On 21 February 2017, the European Commission announced an emergency aid package of &euro;82 million which is aimed at addressing the urgent humanitarian situation in the country. Since December 2013, the EU Commission has provided &euro;381 million in humanitarian funding, which, including vital assistance for internally displaced people, refugees, returnees and other vulnerable people. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to our humanitarian assistance, Ireland and our EU partners have issued strong political statements, most recently through the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2016, condemning the outbreak of violence in South Sudan, and clearly stating that there can be no military solution to the crisis.  The Conclusions called on all parties to observe the ceasefire in full and to take the decisive steps necessary to end the conflict.  The Conclusions also underlined the need for a political solution through the implementation of the existing peace agreement, agreed in 2015, and urged the Government of South Sudan to work with regional and international bodies such as the UN, the African Union and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development to resolve the political crisis.  The EU also called on all parties to allow the full, safe and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to all those in need, which is essential in order to save lives. <\/p>  <p>  At the UN level, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on South Sudan at the Special Session of the United Nation&rsquo;s Human Rights Council, stressing the need for all parties to end the conflict and respect international humanitarian law in December 2016.  At the Universal Periodic Review of South Sudan in November 2016, Ireland requested that the South Sudanese authorities provide unimpeded humanitarian access to vulnerable populations. <\/p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation closely, with our EU partners, through our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, and our Embassies in Kampala and Nairobi.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800083#WREE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":1159,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800083#WREE00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1160,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[9610\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800083#WREE01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department has issued any alerts to Irish embassies in regard to the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1161,"content":"<p>At the outset it is important to state that the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes (and certain related Matters) is independent in the conduct of its investigations.

Accordingly, the UK&rsquo;s decision to withdraw from the European Union has not to date been an item on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC).  Although formal discussions on Brexit have not taken place at the FAC, I have since June spoken at least once with each of my EU Foreign Minister colleagues on the issue of Brexit, over the course of more than 35 engagements; my programme of meetings continues in the weeks ahead.<\/p>  <p>  Protecting the peace process and Northern Ireland is one of the Government&rsquo;s four headline priorities in dealing with the UK decision to leave the European Union.  The established framework for all engagement on Northern Ireland is the Good Friday Agreement.  This has been strongly reaffirmed by the Government and the British Government following the UK decision to leave the European Union.  The Good Friday Agreement is an international treaty, registered with the United Nations and it provides for a unique political and constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland, which is the foundation of the peace process.  This is something the European Union as a whole has long recognised and supported.     <\/p>  <p>  On 23 February, the Taoiseach held a very positive meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at which the Commission President expressed his support and solidarity with Ireland in dealing with the challenges of Brexit, including to uphold the Good Friday Agreement and seek the maintenance of the open border.  The Taoiseach will have a further round of meetings in Brussels this week, when he will meet with President Tusk of the European Council and Michel Barnier, Chair of the European Commission Taskforce. <\/p>  <p>  On 30 January, the Taoiseach discussed with Prime Minister May the serious implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and the imperative of retaining the open border on the island of Ireland.  There will be a need for the British Government to reflect the unique challenges Brexit poses for Northern Ireland in the position they adopt in the negotiations with the EU27.  I reinforced this message in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire in our meeting on 14 February.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that there are entirely unique circumstances in respect of the island of Ireland that must be taken account of in the negotiations for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union and the future EU-UK relationship.  While the Irish Government is actively seeking recognition and accommodation of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, our extensive discussions with partner governments across the EU &ndash; including the UK - have made clear that concepts and terms like &ldquo;special status&rdquo; give rise to serious concerns for other EU partners about precedents that might be set elsewhere.  This would risk undermining the Government&rsquo;s efforts to specifically address and mitigate the very real impacts facing our island &ndash; and the people of Northern Ireland in particular - due to Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  While I entirely understand the rationale of those seeking a &ldquo;special status&rdquo; designation, the fact is that such a proposal would unnecessarily distract from work to secure arrangements which reflect the genuine uniqueness of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s situation, founded in the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, as well as its geographic status as the only land border between the UK and the EU27.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 February, I outlined to the House the need for specific, effective, and realisable measures that could address the major issues of concern under Brexit, whether these relate to the border, or to the citizenship, constitutional and human rights provisions of the Agreement, or otherwise.  The Government will also be advocating for the continuation of the range of EU policy supports to Northern Ireland and the peace process, including in relation to EU funding and is looking at existing precedents and potential innovative approaches in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with our EU partners and EU Institutions and prepare comprehensively in support of our overall negotiating objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800083#WREE01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800083#WREE01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1169,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[9796\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800083#WREE01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of persons assigned to the re-established EU division within his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1170,"content":"<p>There are currently twenty-six officials assigned to EU Division.

This support has been based on clear reasoning and analysis of the various options and alternatives, and those reasons remain valid, despite growing concerns about the possibility of achieving such a solution. <br \/><br \/>The inescapable fact is that a two state outcome remains better than any other model that has been considered, and is the only one which can deliver peace, security, freedom and justice for both Israeli and Palestinian peoples. <br \/><br \/>An acceptable one state outcome could only be on the basis of full equality between all those living under its jurisdiction.

The timing of the next meeting is to allow Ministers to report back on issues raised by our communities abroad with them during their St Patrick's Day travel programmes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800084#WRFF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1207,"content":"<p>Question No. 473 answered with Question No. 454.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":1209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800084#WRFF01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ethics in Public Office Recommendations","counter":1208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800084#WRFF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1209,"qnumday":474,"qnumall":"[10267\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800084#WRFF01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide a full report on the actions and investigations being taken on foot of the reports of the Moriarty tribunal; the status of these investigations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":1210,"content":"<p>The Deputy may wish to note that one recommendation (62.15) of the Moriarty Tribunal falls within my remit.\u00a0 This recommendation seeks that consideration be given to Office Holders, (within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Acts, 1995 and 2001), being able to elect voluntarily to have their financial affairs audited by an inspector appointed by the Standards in Public Office Commission.

This is a very clear indication that the Arts Council is prioritising arts participation by young people and children.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Charter, the Creative Ireland Programme,which the Taoiseach and I launched in December, places a special focus on &ldquo;Enabling the Creative Potential of Every Child&rdquo;. Building on the Arts in Education Charter this will involve the development of an integrated plan to enable every child in Ireland to access tuition in music, drama, art and coding by 2022.  My Department will be working with relevant Departments and other stakeholders over the coming months to develop this plan.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800086#WRHH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":1274,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800086#WRHH01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1275,"qnumday":498,"qnumall":"[10094\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800086#WRHH01300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the cost of implementing a living wage of &euro;11.50 per hour for all employees directly employed or in agencies funded by her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1276,"content":"<p>I am advised that, based on current staffing and pay levels, the estimated additional annual cost of introducing an hourly wage of &euro;11.50 for all employees, employed both directly in my Department and in agencies under its aegis and who are not already paid that amount or more, would be in the order of &euro;2 99, 000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800086#WRHH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hen Harriers Threat Response Plan","counter":1277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800086#WRHH01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1278,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[10213\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800086#WRHH01600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if a person (details supplied) is entitled to hen harrier compensation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1279,"content":"<p>My Department was in correspondence with the named individual and a farm planner in relation to drawing up a plan for the NPWS Farm Plan Scheme, but a plan was never submitted.

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:<\/p><p>- the health needs of the public;<\/p><p>- the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;<\/p><p>- the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;<\/p><p>- the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;<\/p><p>- the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;<\/p><p>- the clinical need for the item or listed item;<\/p><p>- the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;<\/p><p>- the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and<\/p><p>- the resources available to the HSE. <\/p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza for maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.<\/p><p>In June of last year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.  The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.<\/p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at:<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement and is made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the drug Respreeza was considered by HSE Drugs Group which did not make a recommendation for reimbursement on clinical grounds.  The HSE Leadership team has accepted the Drugs Group recommendation of non-reimbursement.<\/p><p>Under the HSE statutory assessment process the HSE is required to set out a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company.  The HSE is legally required to provide at least a 28 days period (from the formal written notice of proposal) to enable the pharmaceutical company to consider any such proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE if it wishes to do so.  The HSE is legally required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.<\/p><p>Therefore as the statutory process is still on-going the Company has an opportunity to have further discussions with the HSE. <\/p><p>In relation to the compassionate access scheme operated by the manufacturer, CSL Behring, I note and welcome the decision of the Company to extend the scheme by a further two months.  However it is important to point out that the operation of such compassionate schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers. I as Minister for Health have no role in the operation of these schemes.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need. <\/p><p>I have previously said that any attempts by manufacturers to link continued access for patients already being treated with a new medicine with decisions under the statutory reimbursement process is both inappropriate and unethical and that manufacturers should operate such schemes in a compassionate and not a commercially-motivated manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800087#WRJJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1327,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800087#WRJJ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1328,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[9569\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800087#WRJJ02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department will review the decision not to award funding for an armchair to an adult special needs day service (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1329,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800087#WRJJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Availability","counter":1330,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800087#WRJJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1331,"qnumday":516,"qnumall":"[9572\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800087#WRJJ02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to roll-out the use of the drug Abiraterone (details supplied).","asker":"1303","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1332,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the community drug schemes or as a hospital medicine, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list or to be priced as a hospital medicine.  <\/p>  <p>  Abiraterone has been reimbursed under the community drugs scheme since 2012 for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) which has progressed on or after a docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen and has been reimbursed since May 2015 for the treatment of mCRPC in adult men who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated.<\/p>  <p>  The company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients or for a different indication of the drug.

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:<\/p>  <p>  1. the health needs of the public;<\/p>  <p>  2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;<\/p>  <p>  3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;<\/p>  <p>  4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;<\/p>  <p>  5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;<\/p>  <p>  6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;<\/p>  <p>  7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;<\/p>  <p>  8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and<\/p>  <p>  9. the resources available to the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.<\/p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website.  It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi and Kalydeco.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of the negotiation process, I am advised that the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee met at the end of January and considered the manufacturer's latest price offerings.  The statutory process is still ongoing but I expect it can be concluded in a period of weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800089#WRLL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800089#WRLL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1389,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[9664\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800089#WRLL00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Donegal will receive an orthopaedic appointment at Letterkenny University Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1390,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 100 die from the disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types.  In 2009 the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommended HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  <\/p><p>Although there is no scientific basis to recent claims about the vaccine, this has led to a reduction in uptake rate of the vaccine from a high of 87% in the 2014\/2015 academic year to 72.3% in the 2015\/2016 academic year.  Figures released by the HSE indicate that the uptake rate for the current year may be even lower.  The first round of the 2016\/17 HPV vaccine schedule has been completed with preliminary uptake figures of 40-50% in all Community Health Organisations.  <\/p><p>The focus for the HPV programme in 2017 is to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of the HPV vaccine, and to increase the uptake rate in girls as part of the schools immunisation programme.  <\/p><p>In the spring of 2016, the HSE began consulting with stakeholders with an interest in HPV\/cervical cancer to explore ways of tackling negative publicity and misinformation.  The HSE and Irish Cancer Society (ICS) agreed to take a coordinated approach to correcting HPV vaccine misinformation.  The HSE and ICS worked closely over the last few months to develop plans and schedule activities.  As a result, a two pronged approach was agreed between the ICS and the HSE which has been implemented since before the start of the 2016\/17 HSE vaccination programme in September.  The HSE took a number of actions which included providing information to all school principals, management bodies and National Parents Councils, and meeting with the Department of Education and Skills and school management bodies.  <\/p><p>The 2016\/17 HSE vaccination programme started in September 2016 and parents of girls in first year of second level school were given an information leaflet, consent form and cover letter with contact phone numbers for their local immunisation office.  Since then, the following actions have been taken:<\/p><p>- Inclusion of new section on HSE websites &ndash; 12 key facts about HPV vaccine which address specific issues raised by anti-vaccine groups<\/p><p>- Short information videos developed for HSE website.<\/p><p>- Articles written in publications for health care professionals<\/p><p>- HSE social media campaign underway<\/p><p>- Ongoing interviews for radio, TV, press and online<\/p><p>- Collaboration with ICGP in production of e-learning modules on HPV vaccine &ndash; now available on ICGP website<\/p><p>- Liaison with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Irish Pharmacy Union to promote HPV vaccine and articles written for their websites and publications<\/p><p>- HPV vaccine meeting held with health representatives of all parliamentary parties and interested public representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann (arranged by the Irish Cancer Society and attended by the HSE)<\/p><p>- Presentation at the National Parents Council AGM on HPV vaccine safety<\/p><p>- Attendance at World Health Organization meeting with Danish Health authorities and international experts to discuss strategy to manage decline in HPV vaccine uptake<\/p><p>- Attendance at WHO HPV Prevention and Control Board meeting and seeking further information from partners in countries who have similar difficulties<\/p><p>- Presentation at the ICGP winter scientific meeting on HPV vaccine safety<\/p><p>- Ongoing training sessions across the country for HSE vaccination teams, GPs and practice nurses<\/p><p>- Ongoing liaison with the Irish Cancer Society, National Cancer Screening Programme, National Cancer Control Programme, the Marie Keating Foundation and the Irish Family Planning Association<\/p><p>- Ongoing liaison with the Department of Education and school management bodies.  <\/p><p>Since November 2016, the following additional actions have been taken:<\/p><p>- Teleconferences with Principal Medical Officers ongoing to review programme and plan for 2nd round of immunisation and the 2017\/18 campaign<\/p><p>- Meeting with Department of Education<\/p><p>- Ongoing meetings with key stakeholders including Royal College of Physicians Ireland and UK colleagues (no drop in uptake in Great Britain, possible drop in Northern Ireland border counties)<\/p><p>- Presentation at Faculty of Public Health Medicine Winter Scientific meeting on &ldquo;HPV vaccine-separating fact from fiction&rdquo;.<\/p><p>- Results of focus groups on HPV vaccine parents attitudes and experience led to changes to information materials and parental letters for 2nd round  2016\/17 (to be sent to all parents to allow parents who wish to change their mind and consent to vaccination)<\/p><p>- Launch of HPV vaccine safety and effectiveness lesson for Transition Year Students as part of Science and Technology in Action.<\/p><p>- European Cervical Cancer Awareness week 23-27 January 2017<\/p><p>- Twitter hour on HPV vaccine 25 January 2017.  <\/p><p>The following actions are planned or underway:<\/p><p>- Focus groups with parents<\/p><p>- Enhanced programme for administration for Dose 2 HPV vaccine<\/p><p>- Planning for 2017\/18 HPV vaccination campaign<\/p><p>- Offer 1st dose of vaccine to those who refused it in March \/April 2017 (as part of 2nd round)<\/p><p>- Implement comprehensive communications plan targeting those more likely to refuse vaccine and using results of social media analysis<\/p><p>- Meet with management bodies, parents&rsquo; councils and unions of primary and post primary schools<\/p><p>- Send revised information leaflet and  consent form to parents of first year students<\/p><p>- Develop and send information to 6th class primary school parents<\/p><p>- Continue engagement with national and international stakeholders- Review information materials and plan for 2017\/18.  <\/p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  The parents of all eligible girls are strongly encouraged to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800093#WRPP02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Data","counter":1575,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800093#WRPP02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1576,"qnumday":602,"qnumall":"[10176\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800093#WRPP02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the total number of beds for close observation for older persons' mental health services in each catchment area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1577,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800093#WRPP02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":1578,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800093#WRPP02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1579,"qnumday":603,"qnumall":"[10177\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800093#WRPP02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an assessment will be carried out on a person (details supplied).","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1580,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing.  The International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) advice is that there should be no targeted fisheries in 2017 and 2018 and that any possible provision for landing of bycatch should only happen as part of a management plan.<\/p>  <p>  While I note the anecdotal reports on increased numbers of Picked Dogfish, the Marine Institute fully supports the ICES advice and has very serious concerns about the state of the stock.  Given such robust scientific advice, there does not appear to be a case for the re-opening of a commercial fishery for Picked Dogfish at this time.<\/p>  <p>  The TAC and quota Regulation\u00a0for 2017 (EU Regulation 127\/2017) lists Picked Dogfish as a prohibited\u00a0species and has a prohibition for EU fishing vessels to fish for, retain on board, to tranship or to land picked dogfish, with the exception of fish caught\u00a0by a vessel engaged in a by-catch\u00a0avoidance programme that has been positively assessed by\u00a0European Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).<\/p>  <p>  The EU Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for Picked Dogfish is \u00a0set at 270 tonnes\u00a0for 2017 with 53 tonnes available to Ireland.

Wicklow, a Steering Group was established in late 2016 to oversee a reduction in the deer density in that area. \u00a0The Group is comprised of representatives of local farmers, the Irish Deer Management Forum (IDMF), the Wicklow Deer Management Partnership (WDMP), the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Arts Heritage, regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The Steering Group has appointed a local co-ordinator to manage the project. The co-ordinator is responsible for organising local hunters to implement the density reduction programme, liaising with landowners in the area, collecting and storing samples for scientific analysis and reporting regularly to the Steering Group on progress. Funding for the project has been made available by both Departments.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also in the process of organising a wider study on the prevalence of TB in deer in Wicklow as a whole. Samples will be collected from culled deer across the entire county and will be subject to detailed analysis with a view to determining the linkage between TB in deer and TB in cattle in the area. In addition, my Department is funding a proof-of-concept pilot deer fencing project to demonstrate to farmers how fencing may prevent deer from gaining access to lands. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to dealing with the deer problem, my Department has increased the intensity of its approach to the management of bovine TB in Co. Wicklow.\u00a0 All TB breakdowns in cattle herds are investigated by veterinary staff from the local offices and there is increased usage both of tuberculin and blood testing for TB in order to try and get ahead of the infection cycle.\u00a0 Extra staff has been assigned to the badger programme and last year more badgers were removed from Co.

Two certification groups will also be established as part of this exercise to help reduce the cost for those wishing to certify their woodlands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800101#WRXX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":1877,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800101#WRXX00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1878,"qnumday":705,"qnumall":"[10292\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800101#WRXX00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the closure of Harold's Cross greyhound stadium and the possible sale of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1879,"content":"<p>Bord na gCon has statutory responsibility for the development of the greyhound industry.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.\u00a0 The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008 -2010. The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.\u00a0 The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published\u00a0projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6 - 11% below 2005 levels, depending on whether additional policies or measures beyond those already in place by the end of 2014 are implemented. On a cumulative basis over the period 2013 - 2020, Ireland is projected to\u00a0have a deficit of between 3 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2eq). According to the latest\u00a0inventory published by the EPA in November 2016, GHG emissions for 2015 are estimated to be 59.84 MtCO2eq. This is 3.7% higher than emissions in 2014.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, the\u00a0shortfall to 2020 projected by the EPA reflects both the constrained investment capacity over the decade between 2008 and 2019 due to the economic crisis (including the impact of the troika programme and the EU fiscal governance requirements), and the fact our 2020 target was very significantly above what would have been cost-effective for Ireland to contribute to the overall EU effort. It now represents a significant challenge to be addressed, including as we look out to 2030. It will be necessary, therefore, to pursue other available options, in addition to the introduction of further policies and measures planned as part of the development of the National Mitigation Plan, if we are to address this gap to target.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the first place, this will include\u00a0the retirement of Annual Emissions Allocations and units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexibility Mechanisms carried forward from 2008-2012 which can be offset against the deficit. If this\u00a0does not fully address any potential deficit, further carbon units could be purchased. It is not possible to accurately quantify the cost to purchase\u00a0 notional carbon units at this stage as the cost is dependent on both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800103#WRZZ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1971,"content":"<p>Question No. 738 answered with Question No. 727.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":1972,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800103#WRZZ01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1973,"qnumday":739,"qnumall":"[10289\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800103#WRZZ01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to supply a high speed broadband service to a location (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1331","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1974,"qnumday":740,"qnumall":"[10290\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800103#WRZZ02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to supply a high speed broadband service to a location (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1331","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1975,"qnumday":741,"qnumall":"[10295\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800103#WRZZ02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to supply a high speed broadband service to a location (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1331","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1976,"qnumday":742,"qnumall":"[10303\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800103#WRZZ02200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to supply a high speed broadband service to a location (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1331","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1977,"qnumday":743,"qnumall":"[10304\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800103#WRZZ02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to supply a high speed broadband service to a location (details supplied) in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1331","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1978,"qnumday":744,"qnumall":"[10306\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800103#WRZZ02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to supply a high speed broadband service to a location (details supplied) in County Louth.

A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I and Minister Humphreys\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in July 2016.\u00a0 The findings of this Taskforce recommends practical actions that can be taken\u00a0to remove barriers to and improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland.

Since 2007, the harvest of salmon, by commercial fishing and recreational angling has been restricted to those rivers that are meeting their individual conservation limits for wild salmon.<\/p>  <p>  Research into salmon genetics indicates that each of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers has its own unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as\u00a0juveniles and returns to the same river as mature salmon to spawn and propagate the next generation of salmon distinctive to that river. <\/p>  <p>  The harvesting of salmon either by recreational anglers or commercial draft net fishermen is only considered in rivers where the estimated salmon returns are above the conservation limit for any particular river.  The conservation limit for any river is the number of adult spawning fish required to maintain a viable and sustainable salmon population. <\/p>  <p>  The status of the stock in each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 designated salmon rivers, sections of rivers and estuaries is reviewed annually by the Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) comprised of Scientists from a range of organisations.  The independent scientific advice provided by the Committee underpins the management decisions made by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) in respect of the opening or closing of a river for angling and commercial fishing for salmon on an individual river basis.<\/p>  <p>  The annual Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Tagging Scheme Regulations, made under the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, provide for the management of Ireland's wild salmon and sea trout fisheries by IFI.  Specifically, the Regulations provide for the quotas of fish (surplus to the conservation limits) that can be harvested either commercially or by rod and line from those rivers identified in the Schedule to the Regulations. These Regulations are revised each year taking account of advice from IFI, the Standing Scientific Committee and any submissions received during a 30 day statutory public consultation period.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing the status of salmon stocks for any particular river, the Committee draws on a number of data sets including rod and commercial catch data, fish counter data and the results from catchment wide electro-fishing.

Under the Better Energy Homes (BEH) scheme, the grant available for an oil or gas boiler upgrade is\u00a0limited to\u00a0&euro;100, a small contribution, and is only available when the upgrade is carried out along with the installation of heating controls. Heating controls are an extremely effective way of saving energy and using less fuel.  The incentive of a grant for a\u00a0new boiler is aimed at making the public aware of the grant supports available from SEAI and introducing them to the much wider set of energy efficiency measures they could undertake with SEAI support. SEAI are, at present, carrying out a full review of the technologies that are supported under the BEH scheme.  This will consider the range of technologies that are available to deliver energy savings and look at where Government support will be most effective.<\/p>  <p>  While the Better Energy Programme has been extremely successful in encouraging homeowners to carry out energy efficiency works, the majority of savings have\u00a0come from lower cost, more accessible measures such as attic insulation and energy conservation campaigns.  Tackling these easier, cheaper measures first is a sensible approach and it has done a great deal to raise awareness of energy efficiency.  Now, with the aim of putting Ireland on realistic trajectory to 2030 and 2050 climate\u00a0and energy targets, as outlined in the recently published\u00a0National Mitigation Plan briefing document, the depth of energy efficiency upgrades needs to increase.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Better Energy Communities\u00a0 (BEC) scheme, renewable energy heating systems are already supported. Heat pumps and biomass boilers are being grant funded this year\u00a0at up to\u00a050% (or\u00a0up to 95%\u00a0for fuel poor households) when carried out with a combined fabric upgrade.  Promoting\u00a0a &ldquo;fabric first&rdquo; approach\u00a0reduces heat losses, makes it easier to keep a\u00a0home warmer and more comfortable for longer periods and reduces the likelihood of installing an oversized heating system. <\/p>  <p>  Experience from the BEC scheme, as well as from various pilot schemes I will roll out this year, will be used to form an evidence base to inform future national policies on low carbon heat and create the business cases necessary for large-scale projects to\u00a0apply\u00a0for EU funding, which my Department will be seeking to avail of in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  One of these pilot\u00a0initiatives will, for example, offer deep energy efficiency upgrades to people currently participating in the Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme.  Families who\u00a0become involved in this\u00a0pilot\u00a0can expect to experience warmer, more comfortable homes, significantly reduced energy bills, a higher property value and even improved health and wellbeing.  From Ireland's national\u00a0perspective, it will lower Ireland&rsquo;s CO2 emissions, support local construction industry jobs and contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets. <\/p>  <p>  More widely, the pilot will serve as a demonstration to the families throughout Ireland who are dependent on solid fuels as their primary heating source that there are alternatives, that energy efficiency can deliver real benefits and that moving away from solid fuels will be of benefit to them and the country as a whole.

If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to the independent regulator of the telecommunications sector, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.<\/p><p>The provision of telecommunications services, including mobile phone services, is a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by ComReg.  I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.  However,\u00a0mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.

While under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Grant Funding Agreement, registered childcare providers must ensure that pre-school leaders hold a at least a major award in early childhood care and education at Level 6 on the NFQ. <\/p>  <p>  This particular service provider runs a pre-school in a rural area in Co Limerick.  She made an application to my Department for qualifications assessment last year.  The ultimate outcome of this application was that she met the minimum  requirements under the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016, and not the minimum requirements under the ECCE Grant Funding Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  It is my understanding that this service has no member of staff who meet the requirement for a room leader at the standard capitation rate for ECCE (i.e being a relevant major award at Level 6 or more on the NFQ).  Following a direct appeal by the service provider, my Department permitted her to run the ECCE programme for the 2016 \/ 2017 programme year, as an exception to the usual Grant Funding Agreement requirements.  This was permitted on a one-off basis and this is the only provider within the ECCE scheme for whom this temporary exception was made. <\/p>  <p>  In allowing this exception, my Department was mindful that this service is in a rural area, which lacks many alternatives for pre-school provision.  Also, I understand that when the qualification assessment was communicated to this service provider, it was nearing the end of the 2015 \/ 2016 programme year, and she had many bookings already for the 2016 \/ 2017 programme year. <\/p>  <p>  My Department took into account the service provider's situation specifically that the local community would have very little time to make alternative arrangements, given the lack of ECCE services in the area.  The service provider was clear that it was her intention to retire following the 2016 \/ 2017 programme year, but that she wished to offer the 2016 \/ 2017 ECCE year in order to facilitate and support the local community and give adequate notice that her service would not function beyond this time. <\/p>  <p>  In view of the circumstances, and to support the service provider's efforts to provide an ECCE service for her community for a further year, an official from my Department wrote to her and stated that she would be allowed to deliver the ECCE programme for the 2016 \/ 2017 programme year. However, this situation as it stands cannot be allowed to continue beyond that time frame under any circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that my Department cannot allow services which are not compliant with the contractual requirements, under the ECCE Grant Funding Agreement, to continue to remain within our programmes.

The conduct of Focus Groups will provide for the collection and analysis of qualitative data to complement and further inform the quantitative nature of the Climate Survey findings.   <\/p>  <p>  A total of seventy three (73) Focus Groups have recently been conducted throughout the Defence Forces.

The countries that Ireland will be collaborating with on this Category B project are the same as for MARSUR with the addition of Portugal.<\/p><p>- A project relating to training in Manual Neutralisation Techniques was set up in 2014.  Manual Neutralisation is a method used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (IEDD) Operators where complex explosive devices have to be neutralised manually and where it is not possible to use remote or semi remote techniques such as robots to render the device safe.  The project will run for four (4) years.  The countries that Ireland is collaborating with on this project are Austria, Germany, Italy and Sweden.<\/p><p>- Also since November, 2016, Ireland has participated in a project in relation to Cooperation on Cyber Ranges in the European Union.  This projects aim to maintain and improve cyber resilience as well as the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of Member States' personnel in the area of cyber security and defence.  The countries that Ireland will be collaborating with on this project are Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.<\/p><p>Opportunities will continue to be identified to expand Ireland's participation in multi-national capability development projects within the framework of the EDA in support of Defence Forces' operations, capacity and capability.<\/p><p>Ireland's cooperation with NATO is conducted through the Partnership for Peace (PfP) which we joined in 1999 following approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Ireland's purpose in participating in the PfP is to improve Defence Forces capabilities and to ensure that our Defence Forces are interoperable with the forces of other States engaged in UN mandated crisis management operations. Participation in PfP provides us with opportunities to avail of joint training with other countries and to access courses provided by the NATO schools.<\/p><p>Ireland has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence which provides a framework for developing and furthering bilateral co-operation and relations between the Department of Defence and the UK Ministry of Defence.  The MoU takes into account matters such as military forces training; exercises and military education; exchange of views on EU Common Security and Defence Policy; potential for joint contributions to UN Crisis Management Operations; joint procurement initiatives; pooling and sharing resources; general sharing on reform in defence services; potential for staff exchanges; sharing of information, and joint contribution to Security Sector Reform and capacity building in crisis locations.  It envisages cooperation and exchanges involving both civil and military personnel.  The MoU provides opportunities for more joint and collaborative work in support of international peace and security.  It will also enhance the potential for further joint contributions to UN peacekeeping operations.<\/p><p>It is paramount that the Irish Defence Forces are equipped to carry out their roles at home and overseas.  Therefore, there has to be particular focus on developing capabilities, exploring pooling and sharing opportunities and undertaking joint training with other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800111#WRHHH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":2298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800111#WRHHH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":2299,"qnumday":853,"qnumall":"[10097\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017022800111#WRHHH02100","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the cost of implementing a living wage of &euro;11.50 per hour for all employees directly employed by his Department and in agencies funded by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":2300,"content":"<p>The Defence Organisation includes civil servants, military personnel and civilian employees attached to military installations. <\/p>  <p>  The annual cost, including Employer's PRSI, of implementing a living wage of &euro;11.50 per hour in respect of Civil Service Staff and Civilian Employees employed by my Department is estimated at &euro;108,278.
