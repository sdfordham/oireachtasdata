I have an abbreviated version of the statement that I provided some weeks ago and I don't believe the ... either yourself or the members have it.  So, good morning again, Chairman, and members of the committee.  As the chairman has introduced me, I'm Patrick Neary.  I held the position of prudential director of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority from 1 May 2003 until 31 January 2006, after which I was appointed to the position of chief executive from 1 February 2006 until 31 January 2009.  Before I begin my statement, I would like to say that, with hindsight, the supervisory measures taken by the authority, which I will be outlining in this statement, were not sufficient to meet the challenges posed by the crisis and the recession that emerged.  I am deeply sorry about that.<\/p>  <p>  I'd like to describe the various regulatory actions and initiatives taken by the authority over the period up to end-2008 such as higher capital requirements, new liquidity requirements, new requirements for impaired loans, new fitness and probity tests, new consumer protection requirements for impaired loans, better regulation policy and oversight by the IMF and the OECD.  <\/p>  <p>         I would like to describe the various regulatory actions and initiatives taken by the authority over the period up to end-2008, such as higher capital requirements; new liquidity requirements, new requirements for impaired loans, new fitness and probity tests, new consumer protection requirements for impaired loans, better regulation policy and oversight by the IMF and the OECD.<\/p> <p> I will begin with the regime of prudential supervision.  The Central Bank Act 1971 first established the prudential supervision of banks in Ireland.  The primary purpose of prudential supervision is to safeguard, as far as possible, depositors in banks.  In fact, no prudential supervision of any entity involved in lending is required if that entity doesn't also take deposits.  The approach to supervision by the authority derived from EU banking supervision legal requirements.  The authority&rsquo;s approach, in the same way as that of other countries' banking supervisors, was subject to ongoing best practice review and external assessment by international bodies such as the IMF and the OECD.  These agencies benchmarked in detail the authority against a framework of principles entitled the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision.  The conclusions of all these assessments by these independent expert bodies in relation to the authority were very favourable, such as would indicate that the approach of the authority was at least as good, if not better than other authorities reviewed by those agencies.  The five key constituents of the Basel core principles, which are fundamental to the prudential supervision of banks, are referred to as the CAMEL principles; which is an acronym of capital adequacy, asset quality, management and earnings and liquidity.<\/p> <p> A bank&rsquo;s capital is the ultimate protector of depositors and there are international rules setting minimum requirements for all banks which have been enshrined into EU and Irish law.  It provides the cushion to absorb losses that arise in the loans made by a bank.  EU law requires that an EU bank must hold a level of capital to a value of at least 8% of the value of its risk assets.  I would like to make the following observations.  All loans made by a bank have a risk weighting attached to them to determine its total risk assets.  Loans to EU governments attract a 0% weight, meaning, under EU law, a bank has to hold no capital whatsoever in respect of these loans.  Put differently, it is assumed by the law that these loans will not default and this practice continues today.  Loans to other EU banks with a maturity of less than one year attract a 20% weight, which may go some way to explaining the attraction to EU and international banks of funding the activities of Irish banks during the boom period.  Recognising that the EU legal requirements were minimum standards, the authority required the Irish banks to hold capital within a range of 8.5% to 11% of risk-weighted assets.<\/p> <p> On 1 January 2007, the capital requirements directive, commonly known as Basel II, came into effect.  This directive afforded supervisory authorities some discretion to tailor capital requirements to reflect national circumstances.  Using this discretion, the authority introduced a more stringent capital regime for property transactions to counter the growing exposure of Irish banks to the property sector.  I am not aware of any other instance where an EU banking supervisor imposed tougher requirements on their banks than the basic minimum requirements of Basel II.  At the requirement of the authority, the Irish banks were subject to much higher capital requirements than the EU demanded, for instance, Basel II assigned a risk weighting of 35% for residential mortgages, irrespective of the loan to value of those mortgages.  The authority set a 75% weighting for such loans by Irish banks having a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 75%.  For residential investment mortgages, Basel II also assigned a risk weighting of 35%.  The authority made the entire loan subject to a weighting of 75%.  Basel II allowed a 50% risk weighting for secured commercial real estate; the authority required 100%.  Basel II applied a 100% weighting to speculative real estate loans; the authority demanded 150%.<\/p> <p> Staying with residential property, the authority&rsquo;s decisions reflected the economic and growth forecasts from the Central Bank, which it was obliged to follow.  These predicted a soft landing and if that prediction had been fulfilled, there wouldn't have been a banking crisis.  In mid-2007, the authority introduced a number of additional supervisory requirements on the banks as a response to the strong appetite for credit for residential property purpose.  Stress testing of individual mortgage applications to gauge repayment ability at a level 2.75% above the ECB rate.  Introducing the consumer protection code with measures to address aggressive lending including suitability.  A ban on pre-approved credit and obligations to engage early with customers in arrears.  <\/p>  <p>         Eleven separate press campaigns were carried out in relation to debt as well as numerous interviews and published articles.  I have to stress that these were the minimum standards expected of banks.  The authority did not run the banks and these minimum standards did not excuse the boards from their duties to set appropriate policies.<\/p> <p> In July 2005, well before the crisis in financial markets began to take hold, the authority imposed new conditions on the licences of the Irish banks in relation to credit risk management policies and procedures which required each bank to have specified arrangements in place to monitor and control credit risk, with particular focus on impairments and provisions.  Each bank was obliged to comply with international financial reporting standards and was obliged to advise the authority of deterioration in the credit quality of its loans.  These reports formed part of the quarterly statutory returns submitted by each bank to the authority and never indicated deterioration in loan quality.<\/p> <p> In line with Basel supervisory best practice and corporate governance codes, the authority required that all appointments to the board of a bank and any of its subsidiaries should be subject to its approval.  This was to ensure that all directors of a bank, both executive and non-executive, and later, heads of all business critical functions, should be fit and proper persons with the necessary competence and experience in banking to contribute to the proper running of the bank.  A final framework was introduced by the authority in January 2007 and applied to all new appointments from that date.  Existing persons were \"grandfathered\" under the new arrangements.<\/p> <p> In January 2007, the authority imposed new liquidity rules by way of conditions on the licences of the Irish banks.  This made Ireland a leader in Europe in introducing a forward-looking system of liquidity management.  Ireland was the only EU country to have updated its liquidity requirements in advance of the liquidity crisis.  The reporting frequency was increased from monthly to weekly reporting in August 2007 to coincide with the onset of the international liquidity crunch.  In relation to all of the foregoing, I should mention that the OECD, in its Economic Survey of Ireland 2008, commented that the authority had introduced the new consumer code to limit the scope for predatory lending practices and introduced a forward-looking liquidity regime just before the international financial market turmoil struck.<\/p> <p> Just a few words, Chairman, about regulatory strategy.  The authority adopted a principles-led approach to supervision from its inception in 2003, which essentially placed boards and management of banks at the centre of responsibility for the prudent conduct of business.  The authority was legally obliged, at least three months before the beginning of each year, to prepare a strategic plan and submit this plan to the Minister for Finance.  The plan had to specify the objectives of the authority for the financial year concerned, the nature and scope of the activities to be undertaken and the strategies for achieving these objectives.  This principles-led approach to supervision was followed by all EU countries.  The strategy also set down the objectives of the authority.  One of its objectives was that its regulatory approach would facilitate innovation and competitiveness.  It is clear that both of these elements played an important part in the increased availability of credit in Ireland in the years before the crisis, through a combination of more banks entering the market and more innovative types of lending products being developed.<\/p> <p> In January 2004, a White Paper entitled Regulating Better was issued by Government to improve national competitiveness.  The paper called for wider consultation and more regulatory impact assessment on any new regulations.  This illustrates the context in which all supervisory initiatives of the authority required extensive consultation with a wide range of what are termed stakeholders - Government Departments, representative bodies and the industry and consumer panels, for example.  Detailed regulatory impact analysis was extensive.  In fact, the authority also put in place an arrangement with industry, called the stakeholder protocol, which enshrined time commitments by the authority to respond to industry requests for regulatory approvals, issuance of the findings of inspection reports, etc.  I can understand that initiatives such as this formed a perception of the authority as a can-do entity, willing to prioritise industry demands rather than appearing more detached and discerning.  This is something which I believe, in hindsight, both myself and the authority got wrong.<\/p> <p> The growth in private sector credit arose mainly from the appetite for property acquisition and associated construction activity.  This expansion in these areas was due to a number of factors, including strong economic growth, an increase in the level of household formation, very low interest rates, lower personal tax rates, a vast range of tax incentives for property investment, the desire of Irish people for property ownership, a feel-good element generated by increasing property values which quickly seasoned loan-to-value ratios, and all supported by readily available bank loans.  <\/p>  <p>           A further, and extremely important, factor was the consistent pattern of very positive economic commentary in relation to the performance and prospects for the economy and the property market from the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance.  In formulating its strategy, the authority always took full account of the output of these authoritative sources which predicted that the Irish economy would continue to show growth above the EU average and that the property market would experience a soft landing.  The authority relied on the Central Bank, which maintained an economic services division with 86 staff, including a dedicated financial stability department, to monitor and assess the overall health of the financial system.  Had these predictions held, there wouldn't have been a bailout.<\/p> <p> Questions have rightly been asked in relation to number, skillset and experience of resources devoted to the supervision of banks.  As mentioned in the Honohan report, staff numbers in the banking supervision department increased marginally from 44 at end 2005 to 48 at end 2008, and were allocated in teams to supervise portfolios of banks.  Apart from considerable day-to-day contact with their respective banks, staff in banking supervision carried out over 50 inspections of banks between 2003 and 2008.<\/p> <p> The authority had approved higher staff.  However, the HR department of the Central Bank, which performed recruitment activities on behalf of the authority, experienced difficulty in attracting persons with banking experience to the department.  This reflected constraints on salary levels available to public servants and very strong salary competition for such persons in a market operating at a high level of economic activity.  I agree with the conclusion in the Honohan report that the authority did not have the mix of skills necessary for a more intrusive style of supervision.  The difficulty in attracting new staff with good experience in banking, and the rapid pace of evolution of the new regulatory directives which had to be implemented, stretched existing staff to the limit, to both engage in ongoing supervision work, while at the same time having to maintain training programmes for newer staff transferring in from other departments in the authority.  There is little doubt that staff were stretched more thinly in banking supervision, and thus the capacity to foresee and react to the unfolding crisis was made more difficult.<\/p> <p> In July 2007 an MOU was put in place between the Central Bank, the authority and the Department of Finance to establish a committee called the domestic standing group to help in the management of financial stability issues and to prepare to handle the financial crisis.  Frequent and regular meetings of the group were held, and a number of work streams emerged dealing with emergency liquidity, deposit protection, draft legislation, as well as the updating of a manual to be used in the event of a crisis.  As the crisis deepened the Department of Finance retained consultants to assist in preparations to nationalise a bank or a building society, and work to determine to what extent there may have been a need for further capital injections to meet market expectations.  I see no reason to call the adequacy of the DSG process into question.  Its operations meant that many issues that could arise in a crisis were identified and examined, and several initiatives relating to emergency liquidity arrangements, draft bank legislation, and capitalisation of banks were undertaken.<\/p> <p> I will now address the bank guarantee decision.  On the evening of 29 September 2008 I accompanied the chairman of the authority to a meeting at the Department of the Taoiseach.  The meeting seemed to have only recently begun when we arrived and was in the process of discussing the serious liquidity position of Anglo, and what facilities could be made available to it to help it survive until the weekend.  Mention was also made of the fact that the two larger banks had sought a guarantee for the deposit holders from the Government earlier that afternoon.  The chairman and I advised the meeting, in relation to the solvency position of each bank, from the point of view of the authority.  We advised the meeting that on the basis of the information available to the authority, all banks were in compliance with their required capital ratios, were in a position to meet their obligations on a going concern basis, but liquidity was becoming a critical issue for them, especially Anglo.<\/p> <p> Both the chairman and I left this meeting after about an hour.  We were asked by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance to remain on in the offices of the Department in case our presence was required later.  We rejoined the meeting some hours later, possibly around 11 o'clock.  On our way back to the meeting room we were met by the Governor of the Central Bank who indicated that the discussions that had occurred since we had left the meeting had narrowed things down to two options, either nationalisation of Anglo coupled with a guarantee of the five remaining banks, or a guarantee of all the banks.  He suggested to us that our view was likely to be sought in relation to these options.  <\/p>  <p>         When we rejoined the meeting, the chairman and I raised a concern about whether there would be confusion in the minds of the market practitioners in the following morning as to who or was not guaranteed, and that making a distinction between nationalised banks and guaranteed banks ran the risk of being misinterpreted by the markets.  We raised a concern that this would either encourage the inflow of liquidity that would be expected to occur, nor would it stem outflows of deposits.  Questions would undoubtedly arise whether the nationalised bank was stronger or weaker than the guaranteed bank and in that situation, all banks would risk being adversely affected.  The chairman and I expressed the view that if a guarantee was going to be put in place, we would be inclined to favour it being extended to cover the depositors in all banks concerned in the same manner.  Some two weeks earlier, confusion had arisen in relation to the increase in the deposit guarantee scheme limit to &euro;100,000, especially as regards whose deposits it covered and the eligibility criteria.  The effects of the guarantee were evident immediately, the daily liquidity reports being submitted by the banks to the Central Bank showed inflows of both market and retail resources and an end to the pattern of outflows which had been occurring prior to the guarantee.  The guarantee was viewed positively by market commentators and was seen as addressing satisfactory the concerns of depositors and thus the funding and liquidity difficulties that had been affecting the banks.<\/p> <p> So just in summary Chairman, in this brief statement I have set out for you the authority's approach to prudential supervision of banks, as well as the various initiatives taken by it to strengthen its oversight of banks such as the higher capital requirements liquidity, impaired loans, fitness and probity, consumer code and the influence of the White Papers on regulatory policy.  I also acknowledge Chairman, with the benefit of hindsight, that the supervisory measures introduced by the authority were not sufficient to meet the challenges posed by the crisis and the recession that emerged and I regret that very deeply, Chairman.  So thank you, Chairman and members of the committee for your attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052800002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432767600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Thank you for your opening statement Mr. Neary and just to remind the ... so that we get the structure of today's proceedings under way, this morning's session will be focusing on the period of Mr. Neary's tenure up to October 2007, while the afternoon session will focus on developments in the period of November 2007 to January 2009, which we will be dealing with this afternoon with you Mr. Neary.

We have had a number of witnesses that have come to us during that period.  I would like to quote some of them to you.  Professor William Black told the inquiry on 5 February that extreme growth itself is something that should not be allowed by a regulator.  We have centuries of experience to tell us this is true and then he went on to say, &quot;The Irish crisis was one of the most easily preventable crises by either competent bankers or competent regulators.&quot;On 21 January, Mr. Klaus Regling told the inquiry:<\/p><blockquote>There was this light-touch approach to supervision, not very intrusive, not very assertive and therefore also imposing penalties just did not happen.  The rules which existed were applied very loosely.<\/blockquote>  <p>Professor Alan Ahearne, appearing before the committee on 4 March said:<\/p><blockquote>They [meaning the regulator] had a certain interpretation of principle-based regulation which meant that they really just looked at whether the banks had certain governance systems in place, including having an audit committee.  They put a lot of trust in the senior management of the banks.  That is the very opposite of intrusive, proper regulation and so the implementation of regulation failed dismally.<\/blockquote>  <p>  <\/p>  <p>               On the 11 October ... of February ... or sorry, 11 February, Professor John FitzGerald said:<\/p><blockquote>The build-up of the bubble could have been prevented by appropriate fiscal policy or by appropriate prudential action by the Central Bank and the regulator, or both.  Either one of these policy instruments, if appropriately deployed, could probably on its own have prevented the disaster.  Both together would have prevented [the] disaster.<\/blockquote> <p>And then, when Professor Honohan came before us, discussing his report and where he wrote about the options available to the Financial Regulator on moral suasion, in questions at the inquiry on 15 January, he said:<\/p><blockquote>[M]oral suasion is useful but is not enough if the regulated entity will not heed ... indication.  Moral suasion has nothing to do with morality.  It has to do with non-legally binding requests whereby one says, &quot;Please stop doing this, please stop doing that&quot; and if the banks know what is good for them, they say, &quot;Okay, let's behave differently&quot;.  However, if they do not respond, it has to be followed up with enforcement, strict directives and rules.  It in not principles versus rules, [it is] principles and rules.<\/blockquote> <p>Mr. Neary, the finger of responsibility would seem to be directly pointed at the office of the regulator in those accounts to the inquiry.  Would you care to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015052800002#G00400","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1432767600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Chairman.  Yes, I think you've set out a number of things there but, at the core of this, is the option chosen by the authority in relation to the way it carried out its business and it shows a principles-led regulatory approach.  Now, that meant that it was a combination of the statutory requirements, some of which I outlined already and we'll just go through them again: capital, proper capital, liquidity; making sure there were proper provisions made for bad debts, ensuring that there was fit and proper management in place etc. etc., we've gone through all of those but they were ... they're the key indicators of prudential soundness, capital and liquidity especially.  On top of that, the authority chose to build, if you like, a further layer of principles, which was directed at each bank and the directors of each bank and what they were obliged to do and I think actually it's set out there in the core documents, I'm sure we'll come to them later on.<\/p>  <p>  Now, I suppose that recognised ... the concept, I think, behind that in the mind of the authority was that, first of all, you had very ... should ... we had experienced directors in the banks that had been with them for a long time.  The banks had built up serious resources.  I mean, for example, in earlier testimony by one of the banks, they told the committee that they had 200 people in the risk management unit alone.  I mean, compared to our resources, that was a lot of people.  So, there was trust and reliance placed on the boards and management of the banks to conduct their affairs prudently and properly.  That was part of the model of supervision that was put in place by the authority and that clearly failed.  Now, I mean, it does stretch credibility, and there's no denying it, that what we were faced here with was a pretty straightforward, you know, lending crisis.  I mean, banks, I believe, with hindsight, should have known what they were doing.  They should have been able to, you know, grant loans and make sure they had them properly secured and make sure they were being repaid.  I mean, that's the very least you would expect them to do and I think that's what the principles-led approach to supervision expected.

I think.  I can home in on one particular discussion that was held at the authority and I think it was around 16 September.

And the authority's consensus at that particular time was in favour of a nationalisation of that entity.

The purpose of the proposed motion is to seek the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA.  The proposed motion follows recent Government approval for Ireland to complete the steps required to ratify the IRENA statute.  As the committee is aware, IRENA is an intergovernmental organisation that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future.  IRENA's aim is to promote the widespread and increased adoption of renewable energy with a view to sustainable development.<\/p> <p>  Ratifying the IRENA statute will allow for full membership and provide improved access for Ireland to data and expertise that will complement the high-quality EU and International Energy Agency research, analysis and support with regard to renewable energy technology and policy developments.  This is particularly important given Ireland's abundant diverse and indigenous renewable energy sources, such as wind and ocean power.  It is also particularly timely, given our objective of transitioning to a low-carbon future and in the context of our involvement in setting EU and global targets for climate and energy matters for the period 2020 to 2030.<\/p><p>The agency, which is headquartered in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, currently has 140 members, including major economies such as the United States, India, Japan, Australia and China.  More than 32 states have started the formal process of becoming members.  The European Union and all its member states are members, apart from Austria and Ireland, both of which are in the process of becoming members.<br\/><br\/>IRENA is financed in the main by mandatory contributions from members.  Those contributions are determined by the IRENA assembly, which convenes annually to discuss and decide upon issues such as the agency's work programme and budget.  Based on the budget agreed in January 2014, Ireland's contribution for 2015 would amount to approximately &euro;70,000.  We will be invited to contribute a <i>pro rata<\/i>share of that sum, depending on the date membership commences.  It is because the IRENA statute involves a charge upon public funds within the meaning of Article 29.5.2&deg; of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann that the terms of the statute require prior D&aacute;il approval.  IRENA's role in attracting a greater profile for renewable energy as a long-term solution to climate change and sustainability aligns with the Government's energy policy objectives of security, sustainability and competitiveness.
