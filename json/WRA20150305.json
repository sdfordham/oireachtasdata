It aims to enhance the employability and mobility of disadvantaged and unemployed persons by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities. In addition, it helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine.<\/p>  <p>  CE schemes are typically sponsored by groups wishing to benefit the local community, namely voluntary and community organisations and, to a lesser extent, public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities. Such projects provide a valuable service to local communities while, at the same time, providing training and educational opportunities to job-seekers.<\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the Department provided an additional 2,000 places bringing the number of CE places to 25,300 for 2014. There are approximately 1,000 CE schemes throughout the country at any one time providing services which range from childcare and social care to community support and drug rehabilitation.  The CE budget for 2015 is &euro;373.3m, which is an increase of nearly &euro;16 million on the 2014 budget to reflect the full year implementation costs of the additional 2,000 places. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the participants and the valuable contribution it makes to local communities. <\/p>  <p>  The Department keeps the operations of the CE scheme under review and, where necessary, it updates the programme to comply with legislation changes, Government policy decisions, (such as Pathways to Work) and Departmental policy decisions (such as the CE Childcare programme). <\/p>  <p>  CE is subject to continuous improvement and schemes are reviewed on a regular basis.

In addition, the assessment also does not include non-welfare expenditure measures for 2015, such as healthcare, education, social housing, and the new housing assistance payments, which will remove the barrier to full-time work for long-term recipients of rent supplement.  Work is ongoing to quantify these impacts as part of the ESRI SWITCH research programme.<\/p>  <p>  The assessment found that for the first time since the economic crisis, budgetary policy will result in an increase in average household incomes of 0.7 per cent (equivalent of &euro;6 per week).

Although long-term unemployment has fallen in line with the overall decline in unemployment, those who are very long-term unemployed continue to be of concern. The <i>Pathways to Work <\/i>strategy for 2015, in addition to ongoing reforms, therefore prioritises additional measures to enhance engagement with the long-term unemployed. This includes a structured process of engagement with the existing long-term unemployed that will see at least 8,300 long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact) each month in early 2015.<\/p><p>A new payment by results contract model with third party providers of employment services for the long-term unemployed, JobPath, will be rolled out by June 2015. It will provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers. Long-term unemployed youth 18-24 can avail of a new initiative, First Steps, a developmental internship programme which is a variant of the JobBridge Scheme. A minimum of 16,000 places for long-term unemployed jobseekers will also be provided through key public employment programmes.  <\/p><p>57,000 Further Education and Training (FET) places will continue to be reserved for long-term unemployed jobseekers in 2015.

For example, in late 2014 the proportion of those on the Live Register for more than three years was 27% for the State.

Expenditure on child benefit payments in 2014 was just over &euro;1.9 billion.  Altogether, the Department spends in the region of &euro;3 billion in providing income support for children and families.<\/p>  <p>  Child income supports and other social transfers are very effective in reducing child poverty.  The 2013 CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions shows that social transfers reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 45.5% to 17.9%, thereby lifting a quarter of all children out of poverty.  This equates to a poverty reduction effect of 60.7% in 2013.  Ireland is amongst the best performing member states in the EU in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has published a social impact assessment of Budgets 2013, 2014 and 2015.  Social impact assessment is an evidence-based methodology which estimates the likely effects of welfare and tax policies on households across income levels and social groups.  <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, Government increased child benefit by &euro;5 per month, at a cost of &euro;72 million.

Furthermore, it found that households with children (earning and non-earning) generally gain more that those without children.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.5%).<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who have lost their business and become unemployed may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. <\/p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p>  <p>  The Group also found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.<\/p>  <p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500053#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Overpayments","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500053#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[9314\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500053#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will introduce a statute of limitations to govern the recovery of overpayments.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>Effective debt recovery is a key aspect of the Department&rsquo;s control policy and it is seen as an integral part of the deterrent approach to social welfare fraud.

However, all customers in this scenario will be able to apply for the back to work family dividend (BTWFD).

There are approximately 70,700 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for 2015. <\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market, including areas in Kildare. The Department has put measures in place to ensure that the housing needs of rent supplement customers who are at risk of homelessness are addressed by providing for increased flexibility within the administration of the rent supplement scheme. Notices were circulated to all Community Welfare Service staff reminding them of their discretionary power to award, on a case by case basis, a supplement for rental purposes in such circumstances in July and December 2014. A National Framework has also been developed to ensure that appropriate supports are provided throughout the country in a consistent manner. <\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s response to the current difficulties in the private rented market remains under close review, including the use of the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol.  The Protocol has been recently extended to Cork city and non-family households in the Dublin area and I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep this matter under review.    <\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s role with regard to persons who are homeless is mainly income maintenance. Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance (SWA), subject to the normal qualifying conditions. <\/p>  <p>  Where a person is residing in homeless accommodation, such as a bed and breakfast or long term hostel, steps are taken to verify their address in order to facilitate continued payment of a social welfare payment such as job seekers allowance. Where a person is homeless and has no fixed abode or has night by night accommodation then he\/she is referred to the Community Welfare Service for support under the SWA scheme. The SWA scheme is considered the \"safety net\" within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. <\/p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of a particular case where a homeless family&rsquo;s social welfare payment has been discontinued, he should forward details to the Department for immediate follow up. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500054#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme Data","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500054#WRC01300"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[9762\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500054#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of applications for mortgage support refused in each of the past three years and to date in 2015; the extent to which such cases have been reviewed or appealed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[9764\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500054#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a mortgage support was refused on the grounds of its unsustainability, and the mortgage was subsequently proven to be sustainable, thereby raising the question of the extent of fair treatment afforded in such cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 56 together. <b><\/b><\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas: <\/p><p>- Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrower; <\/p><p>- A social housing response sponsored by local authorities; <\/p><p>- Comprehensive advice to borrowers; and <\/p><p>- Personal Insolvency Reform. <\/p><p>In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement, the purpose of which was to provide short-term support to meet mortgage interest repayments, does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem. <\/p><p>Discontinuation of entitlement to the mortgage interest supplement scheme came into effect for new applicants from 1 January 2014.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 8.5%).<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who find themselves out of business and become unemployed or ill may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed people in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to the full range of activation measures available through the State.  Given the scale of unemployment levels, the key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.  This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments.  Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.  However, many services are available to the formerly self-employed who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.<\/p>  <p>  Some employment services, such as assistance with job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department's employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status.  Unemployed persons, including the previously self-employed, not in receipt of payments may also be eligible to avail of upskilling opportunities but are not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course.  Springboard courses are open to people who were previously self-employed, regardless of their social welfare status.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.<\/p>  <p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.<\/p>  <p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.

The strategy involves ensuring that any critical bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed.

These licences are issued by the Revenue Commissioners in accordance with the requirements laid down under Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Finance Act 1999. \u00a0In order to obtain a licence, an applicant must satisfy the following requirements.<\/p>  <p>  - The applicant must hold a tax clearance certificate, must not have been convicted of an indictable offence under section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (or of a corresponding offence under the law of another Member State) and must be compliant with excise law in relation to the production, delivery or sale of mineral oils, including the statutory requirements relating to the systems (including the measuring systems) and procedures of the business to which the licence relates. <\/p>  <p>  - The applicant must, when requested to do so by the Commissioners, be able to show to their satisfaction that he or she is able to comply with the licence conditions as specified by them. These include, inter alia, the suitability and security of the premises to be licensed, access by Revenue officers, the use of fuel pumps and meters that accurately measure and record the volume of fuel dispensed and other conditions that the Commissioners may impose. <\/p>  <p>  - The applicant must, when required by the Commissioners, show to their satisfaction that the business to be licensed is for the sole benefit of the applicant, is undertaken with the intent of realising profits from legitimate trade in mineral oils and the systems and procedures of the business to be licensed will provide a full and true account of all the mineral oil transactions of the business, in a form readily accessible to the Commissioners.<\/p>  <p>  As part of their licensing conditions, mineral oil traders must provide a monthly report to Revenue of all their mineral oil transactions by fuel type.\u00a0 The Commissioners advise me that the report from any particular trader must show the fuel receipts and deliveries in the month concerned between that trader and each other mineral oil trader with whom they are trading, together with additional information on all sales of a volume greater than 2000 litres.\u00a0 Forecourt sales of fuel are reported in the aggregate by type for the month. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these licensing conditions is to control the supply chain for mineral oils. Public liability insurance is not relevant to this objective and is not provided for as a licensing requirement. The licenses are renewed annually and may be revoked under certain circumstances. The Revenue Commissioners inform me that they encourage any person who has evidence of non-compliance by a mineral oil trader with the conditions of his or her licence to report the matter to them as soon as possible.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by the Commissioners that the monthly return of mineral oil movement due from each licensed mineral oil trader must report transactions for each fuel type, including petrol. The report shows the total monthly amount of fuel by type received and delivered between the licensed mineral oil trader and each other licensed trader. In view of the key focus on the risk of diesel laundering, the report for diesel also shows the individual receipts and deliveries making up this monthly transaction figure.\u00a0 However, the information in the monthly report allows Revenue to identify suspicious movements of any fuel type, including petrol, and Revenue has the technical capacity to analyse effectively the petrol movements reported. \u00a0The mineral oil trader must, in any case, hold information on all individual fuel transactions, including petrol transactions, and this can be examined by Revenue, as required. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners inform me that they are examining the costs and benefits of extending the more detailed level of reporting in place in relation to diesel to petrol also.\u00a0 Because of the volume of transactions involved, such a development would require a significant enhancement of Revenue's existing system as well as developments in the systems used by mineral oil traders.\u00a0 When the Revenue Commissioners have completed their evaluation, I will let the Deputy know the outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500057#WRF00600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500057#WRF00650"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[9692\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500057#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will confirm that a quote attributed to him which recently appeared in a British news magazine (details supplied) is accurate, that is, if quantitative easing becomes the function of national central banks, rather than primarily of the European Central Bank, then he thinks that it will be ineffective; if he still stands over that assessment; in view of the form of quantitative easing that the European Central Bank has now engaged in, does this involve bond purchases being made by national central banks, rather than by the European Central Bank itself; his views that it will be ineffective; if he does not believe it will be ineffective, then how does he reconcile that assessment with the quote attributed to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The fall in inflation combined with the fact that inflationary expectations have begun to drift downwards poses a risk to price stability.<\/p>  <p>  As a result, and with policy rates effectively at zero per cent,\u00a0the ECB announced an expanded asset purchase programme due to commence this month\u00a0to include bonds issued by euro area central governments, agencies and European institutions. Under this expanded programme, the combined monthly purchases of public and private sector debt securities\u00a0will amount to &euro;60 billion.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These monthly purchases are intended to be carried out from March 2015 until end-September 2016 and will, in any case, be conducted until inflation moves onto a path consistent with price stability.\u00a0Price stability in the euro area, in turn,\u00a0has been defined as annual inflation of close to but below\u00a02 per cent (inflation being measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Monetary policy operations in the Eurosystem are normally carried out on a decentralised basis by the National Central Banks (NCB) and are recorded on the published balance sheets of the NCBs. For example, this applies to the\u00a0regular main refinancing operations carried out each week. For the extended asset purchase program, decentralised implementation also\u00a0applies for at least 80 per cent\u00a0of purchases.  This does not mean that quantitative easing is ineffective - the Eurosystem (consisting of the ECB plus the National Central Banks) is expanding its balance sheet with positive implications for inflation and  economic activity.<\/p>  <p>  Decisions on and the implementation of monetary policy in the euro area are\u00a0entirely a matter for the Governing Council of the ECB, which is independent in these matters. I note, however, that there is\u00a0\u00a0some mutualisation -\u00a0the Governing Council decided that\u00a020 per cent of the additional asset purchases under the programme\u00a0will be subject to\u00a0risk sharing.\u00a0Moreover, the scale of the asset purchase\u00a0programme is rightly seen as being the more important issue, as well as the\u00a0 fact that it is potentially\u00a0open-ended <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Irish economy should benefit through a number of channels. For example, the economy\u00a0should benefit directly through improved financing conditions for households and firms. In addition, the euro area is Ireland's single largest export destination;\u00a0therefore, by supporting real economic activity and raising inflation in the euro area this will underpin export growth in Ireland. Monetary policy also works through the exchange rate channel the depreciation of the euro\u00a0will provide a boost to Irish exports. Raising the rate of inflation in the euro area will also help Ireland achieve our twin goals of improving competitiveness and increasing tax revenue. So, over time, the success of quantitative easing will be seen in terms of stronger growth rates in Ireland and across the euro area, and inflation rates consistent with price stability. <\/p>  <p>  So, in summary, my view is that quantitative easing is an effective policy response and will positively impact on inflation and economic activity in the euro area and Ireland.

In addition, the expenses regime for self-employed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the USC in 2011 included\u00a0a 3% surcharge payable\u00a0on that portion of self-assessed income over &euro;100,000. The alternative would have seen self-assessed high income earners\u00a0benefit when compared\u00a0to their PAYE counterparts from the complete (income tax, USC and PRSI) tax package introduced in 2011. On the basis of fairness, this could not have been countenanced at the time.<\/p>  <p>  The 3% surcharge\u00a0was retained in Budget 2015 in order to ensure that the self-assessed on high incomes did not benefit disproportionately from the Income Tax package and that the maximum benefit is capped for all taxpayers at\u00a0&euro;14 per week.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the changes to the income tax system introduced in Budget 2015 will benefit all those who pay income tax and or USC equally, regardless of whether they are PAYE or self-employed taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am cognisant of the disparities within the current system between self-assessed and PAYE workers, particularly at lower levels of equivalent income. I would hope to be in a position to bring about some changes to the system, subject to having the required fiscal space. It is not possible to be more specific at this stage but like all tax reliefs and expenditures, the position will be considered as part of my Budget deliberations later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500057#WRF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Documents Issuance","counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500057#WRF01250"},{"type":"question","counter":226,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[9811\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500057#WRF01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a warehouse (details supplied) in County Cork still has its licence in place to operate as a bonded warehouse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

However, due to a cost base which is significantly out of line with competitor countries, the company has announced job losses at its Coolock and Kerry plants and the closure of its Tallaght operation.  The company has pledged to support departing workers with placement services.<\/p><p>In response to these developments, I have established an inter-agency group to co-ordinate the Government&rsquo;s response to the job losses at the company.  The group will be led by Enterprise Ireland, and will both seek to secure alternative employment for the areas affected, and also ensure that departing workers have access to supports they need from State agencies for re-training, access to social welfare supports and access to advice on employment rights.<\/p><p>In an effort to co-ordinate constructive cross-party action to support workers affected, I invited TDs and Senators from the areas affected to a briefing in my Department on the situation on Tuesday last. The company was also the subject of a Topical Issues Debate in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday.  <\/p><p>I know that the company have said that they would work closely with workers in an effort to ensure that the impact of its decision is minimised to the greatest extent possible and to discuss investment it will be making in Ireland in order to build a stronger business here for the long term.

Further information can be found on the LEO website at .<\/p><p>Last month, I announced details of the Action Plan for Jobs: Regional Initiative, which will seek to maximise the strengths and assets of each region to support enterprise growth and job creation.  The Regional Action Plans will identify specific measures that can be taken to help each region to realise its economic potential, with a view to increasing the number of people at work in the region.  My objective is that six Regional Action Plans will be launched by July, with two remaining Plans in development at that stage.  It is not intended that Regional Action Plans will target every individual town for job creation or investment but, rather, that these Plans will identify measures that can be taken to enable the region as a whole to build on its competitive strengths and increase the number of people at work.  <\/p><p>As part of this initiative, new funding of up to &euro;250 million will be made available over the next five years to support job creation through enterprise growth in the regions.

The Review involved an assessment of the eligible area of each commonage parcel using ortho-imagery from the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) database.

In the majority of cases, the reductions had no impact on payments made under the Single Payment Scheme. There were a number of reasons for this, which includes the following:<\/p>  <p>  -Many farmers acted in a prudent manner and declared a lesser area than their share of the commonage, which meant that the claimed area was still less than the share of the reduced commonage area.<\/p>  <p>-Some farmers declared more land than the number of payment entitlements held.<\/p>  <p>-It was possible up until 31 December 2009 to re-calculate the number and value of entitlements held by farmers where the eligible area of a commonage was reduced.

This will provide a very clear, easier to understand procedure.

Aftercare is the term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of such young people to assist them in making the transition to independent living. It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires. Aftercare is available to all those eligible irrespective of previous care placement, for example, foster care or residential care.<\/p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.<\/p>  <p>  Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that the Child and Family Agency may assist a child leaving its care if it is satisfied that the person has a &ldquo;need for assistance&rdquo;. The provisions have been interpreted and applied on the basis that young people who have had a care history with the Agency are entitled to an assessment of need, from which an aftercare plan may be prepared and an aftercare service may be offered (based on the assessed needs).<\/p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support.  Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.<\/p>  <p>  Between 450 and 500 young people leave care annually upon turning 18.  According to the Child and Family Agency, at the end of September, 2014 there were 1,698 young people aged 18 to 23 years (inclusive) in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those, 946 (56 %) were in full-time education.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare.  This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published in the early part of 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500065#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inter-Country Adoptions","counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500065#WRO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":476,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[9799\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500065#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide an update on the ongoing negotiations over a bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation; when an agreement will be finalised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":477,"content":"<p>Efforts are ongoing in my Department in relation to a bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption between Ireland and the Russian Federation.

However, different people in various circumstances may require different approaches to treatment and support.  <\/p>  <p>  According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, methadone is the most commonly prescribed substitution treatment for problem opiate use in Europe.

This is true for all age groups but particularly important for the vulnerable elderly whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff.<\/p>  <p>  Person-centred care and support is one of the themes of the HIQA National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare.  Standard 1.6 states that service users' dignity , privacy and autonomy are respected and promoted.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE's Patient Charter describes what an individual can expect when using health and social care services in Ireland.  It is based on eight principles which underpin high quality, people-centred care. Included in these key principles are that we treat people with dignity, respect and compassion, services are provided in a safe environment and that we ensure adequate personal space is provided to ensure privacy in providing care and personal social services.  I am aware that following the events in Aras Attracta late last year the Director General of the HSE wrote to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any care setting are treated with dignity and respect.<\/p>  <p>  In the National Service Plan 2015 the HSE has put in place an enhanced governance and accountability framework for 2015 which makes explicit the responsibilities of all managers to deliver on the targets set out in the National Service Plan across the balanced scorecard domains of Quality and Patient Safety, Access to Services, Finance and Human Resources (HR).  The new Accountability Framework describes in detail the means by which the HSE and in particular Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations will be held to account in 2015 for their efficiency and control in relation to service provision, patient safety, finance and HR.<\/p>  <p>  The framework refers to underperformance as:<\/p>  <p>  - Places patients or services users at risk;<\/p>  <p>  - Departs from what is considered normal practice;<\/p>  <p>  - Fails to meet accepted and required standards for that service.<\/p>  <p>  The Accountability Framework outlines performance management processes and sanctions.  Sanctions include disciplinary measures where appropriate or necessary.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also in the process of developing a Code of Conduct for Health and Social Service Providers.  The primary objective of the Code is to ensure the safety of those that access our services and to support the frontline staff who provide those services.  I expect that the Code will be finalised in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, both I and the HSE will continue to work to ensure that the management and staff of our health and health supported services maintain high standards of ethical behaviour and apply the training and principles of person-centred care in everything they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500067#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500067#WRQ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[9648\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500067#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when an\u00a0assessment of needs\u00a0will be carried out in respect\u00a0of\u00a0a child (details supplied) in Dublin 8; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1008","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>As the issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.

The latest figures from the Central Treatment List at the end of January 2015 indicate that over 9,900 clients were receiving methadone maintenance treatment, of which 14 people were in the age range 16 to 19.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of hidden harm which concerns children living with and affected by substance misuse, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol has commissioned a study to estimate the prevalence of children living with parental substance misuse.  The results of this study are expected later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The latest annual figures from the National Drug-Related Deaths indicate that 350 people died in 2012 due to the toxic effects of drugs, a decrease from 387 in 2011.  There were 86 deaths involving methadone in 2012 as compared with 118 in 2011. In many of these deaths methadone was mixed with another drug.  <\/p>  <p>   Many drug-related deaths are avoidable, particularly those involving methadone or heroin overdoses.  For this reason, I have authorised the HSE to undertake a demonstration study for the use of naloxone in the prevention of opioid overdose.  Naloxone reverses the effects of drugs like heroin, morphone and methadone if someone overdoses. The study, which is now underway, aims to increase access to naloxone for non-medical staff, such as the families or friends of a drug user.  The HSE budget for 2015 also includes an extra &euro;2.1m to support this project and other measures targeting vulnerable drug users, including the provision of enhanced residential detoxification and rehabilitation facilities. <\/p>  <p>  An Expert Group, set up by my Department in 2006, examined the regulatory framework required to facilitate the prescribing, dispensing and supply of buprenorphine\/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone.  In 2011, this Group concluded that methadone is the drug of first choice in the treatment of opioid dependency, but that buprenorphine\/naloxone may be more appropriate for particular cohorts of clients.  The HSE has established an Opioid Substitution Implementation Group to develop a plan for facilitating the wider availability of buprenorphine\/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone.  The Group is expected to report to me shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500069#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Offshore Islands","counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500069#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[9734\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015030500069#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the island health care committee of the Health Service Executive has not yet met members of Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann; the reason for the delay in holding this meeting; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.

In addressing &ldquo;our values&rdquo;, the review sets out Ireland's support for a fairer, more just, more secure and more sustainable world through our development programme, human rights policies, peacekeeping, disarmament and security policies and growing engagement with global issues such as climate change, while also considering the role of the EU and UN in amplifying Ireland's voice and extending its influence.  In relation to &ldquo;our prosperity&rdquo; the review considers the global economic background to the ongoing efforts in support of recovery, growth and job creation, in particular through trade, tourism, education, investment and the enhancement of Ireland's reputation. <\/p>  <p>  The review also considers the fundamental importance for Ireland of our place in Europe and how the Government engages across the broad agenda of EU decision-making to safeguard and promote Ireland's interests and to shape the EU and its global engagement.

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and arising from this, it was decided that the scheme be managed by Pobal, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government. <\/p>  <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s management and administrative services for the Scheme included an invitation to tender for the supply and installation of personal monitored alarms, which was publicly advertised on eTenders on 20 October 2014. The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete. Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas. As the market for the equipment is well established, it was neither necessary nor appropriate to engage in consultations with the market on the matter prior to the tender process. <\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is in the transitional period and the operational hand-over between my Department and Pobal will proceed mid 2015.
