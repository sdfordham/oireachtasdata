It works with all stakeholders, including the industry and law enforcement agencies, to ensure as far as possible that counterfeit or falsified medicines do not reach the public. <\/p><p>  IMB enforcement officers work in cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Customs Service throughout the year to detect counterfeit and illegal medicines coming into the State and to investigate instances of illegal supply of medicines over the Internet from retail outlets not authorised to supply medicines, or illegal supply of medicines on the illicit market. Prosecutions have been brought by the IMB and by the DPP against persons breaching regulations under the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1995-2006 relating to the unauthorised manufacture, importation and supply of medicines, to protect public health and protect against the health risks associated with counterfeit medicines.<\/p><p>  Falsified medicines represent a serious threat to global health and call for a comprehensive strategy both at European and international level. The IMB is part of a global rapid alert system on medicines in the authorised supply chain, which monitors and acts on reports of counterfeit medicines that are detected in the supply chain from the manufacturer through to the patient. The IMB participates in two further rapid alert systems, one EU and one global, which deal with counterfeit medicines in illegal markets and pharmaceutical crimes.<\/p><p>   For the last five years the IMB, Revenue Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have participated in a unified interagency operational approach in Ireland called Operation PANGEA. This is an international initiative coordinated by Interpol, to tackle the internet supply of counterfeit and illegal medicines. The principal focus of Operation PANGEA is the protection of public health. The IMB is represented on the global organising committee for this operation. The activity conducted during this operation is ongoing throughout the year in Ireland with the Revenue Customs Service detecting illegal supplies of medicines at ports and airports and working with Garda&iacute; in investigations to identify criminal activity and prevent harmful internet-supplied medicines getting to unsuspecting members of the public purchasing online. <\/p><p>  Memoranda of Understanding exist between State agencies to support this collaborative approach to combating counterfeit medicines, such as that between the IMB and Revenue Customs Service. The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, provides that Revenue Customs Service officers have enforcement powers under the Act to enable them to adequately respond to instances of illegal importation of medicines, medical devices and other healthcare products. This has proven to be a very positive approach and is evidenced by the amounts of illegal medicines detained annually at the entry points to the State. Further, the Garda&iacute; continually work to identify supply lines of controlled drugs in order to prevent them getting into the drug abuse market. <\/p><p>  To date, no counterfeit medicines have been detected in the legitimate medicines supply chain in Ireland. However several instances of counterfeit medicines have been found in the UK and other EU countries over the last ten years even though these countries have been active in taking significant steps to deter this activity. <\/p><p>  At an EU level, it is recognised that, as falsifications become more sophisticated, the risk to EU patients increases every year. The new Falsified Medicines Directive, Directive 2011\/62\/EU, will come into effect from the 2nd January 2013. The transposition of the Directive into Irish law is in progress. This new legislation will further tighten the regulatory regime to prevent the possibility of infiltration of counterfeit medicines into medicines wholesalers and pharmacies and is intended to further protect patients. It introduces tougher rules to improve the protection of public health with new harmonised, pan-European measures to ensure that medicines are safe and that the trade in medicines is rigorously controlled. These new measures include:<\/p><p>-An obligatory authenticity feature on the outer packaging of key medicines;<\/p><p>-A common, EU-wide logo to identify legal online pharmacies and make it easier to distinguish between legal and illegal online pharmacies throughout the European Union;-Tougher rules on the controls and inspections of producers of active pharmaceutical ingredients; and<\/p><p>-Strengthened record-keeping requirements for wholesale distributors.<\/p><p>  These new measures will be progressively introduced over the next few years.<\/p><p>  The public can be assured that the area of counterfeit medicines is constantly under review. The different State agencies, in particular the IMB, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue Customs Service, are working in a cooperative manner to deter, detect and investigate instances of illegality regarding medicines and will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900064#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900064#WRA00550"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[57058\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900064#WRA00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason he narrowed eligibility for the over 70 years medical card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1096","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>Due to the current financial climate, it is necessary to identify measures to mitigate the escalating costs of the medical card scheme for both the over 70's cohort and the under 70's cohort.<\/p><p>  The changes to income limits for the over 70's, which were announced in Budget 2013, will affect about 5% of the entire over 70's population, which is in the region of 20,000 of the 360,000 over-70's medical card holders.

Future Health sets out the building blocks towards the introduction of UHI and maps out 48 time defined actions that will be taken to achieve the Government&rsquo;s objectives.   <\/p><p>Future Health   is founded on:<\/p><p>- A new focus on health and wellbeing  , moving away from simply treating ill people to a new concentration on keeping people healthy;<\/p><p>- Reforming our primary, hospital and social care services   so we deliver care at the lowest level of complexity; <\/p><p>- Reforming our structures   so we deliver services effectively and efficiently; and<\/p><p>- Reforming our financial systems   so we can enhance financial control and create the incentive to deliver cost effective care.<\/p><p>I am determined to maintain access and quality during the reform process.

For this reason, Future Health   proposes that change be implemented in a step by step manner on the basis of good evidence.  <\/p><p>I recognise that effective consultation and collaboration with stakeholders will be crucial for the successful implementation of the reform programme.  In the two weeks following the launch of Future Health,   I met with some 1,500 local clinical and administrative staff and management as well as regional health forums at fifteen different events across the four HSE regions.  I was accompanied by my Department and by the HSE Director General designate of the HSE.

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place, which is a key requirement for the existing private health insurance market and is designed to keep health insurance affordable for older persons and to maintain the stability of the market.  <\/p><p>  I was pleased, therefore, to recently publish the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2012, to give effect to a new Risk Equalisation Scheme (RES) to be applied from 1 January 2013.  An effective and robust RES is required in the Irish private health insurance market in order to protect affordability for those who need it most.  <\/p><p>  I recently announced the rates of risk equalisation credits to apply in 2013 at the Committee Stage debate in the D&aacute;il on this Bill.  The rates are funded by a stamp duty payable by all insurers in respect of each insured person. The credit is provided at source &ndash; that is, the cost of the policy is reduced by the amount of the risk equalisation credit. The measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums paid in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, as well as the old and the young. This action is in line with plans to move to Universal Health Insurance, under which everyone will be insured for health care. <\/p><p>  The Government remains committed to keeping down both the cost of health insurance, so that it is affordable for as many people as possible, and the general cost of healthcare delivery, as part of measures to ensure the sustainability of the private health insurance market in the transition to a UHI system.  In February of this year I established the Health Insurance Consultative Forum which comprises representatives from the country's main health insurance companies, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA) and the Department of Health.  This Forum was established to generate ideas which would help address health insurance costs, whilst always respecting the requirements of competition law.  The Forum will also give a voice to the insurers in the development of the new Universal Health Insurance model. I have also made it clear to the health insurers that I believe that significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums.  <\/p><p>  In this regard, VHI has commissioned consultants to carry out an external review of their claims.  The review is nearing completion and will look at the opportunities and costs involved in possible reductions in utilisation that can be achieved by implementing appropriate utilisation management approaches. <\/p><p>  I would also strongly advise consumers to shop around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs. The HIA provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits. The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900065#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900065#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[57096\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900065#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cuts he intends to make to reach the target of &euro;780 million; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[57030\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900065#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cuts he intends to make to reach the target of &euro;780 million; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[57024\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900065#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will detail the way in which the projected &euro;781 million reduction in the Health Budget in 2013 will be achieved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900065#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[56889\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900065#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress which has been made in the Health Service Executive West region since the introduction of standardised ambulance response times; the steps being taken to improve ambulance response times in the region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Care Inflation","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900065#WRB01750"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[57078\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900065#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason healthcare inflation here is the second highest in Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p> Ireland recorded the third lowest rate of inflation in the Health Category in the EU 15.

In recent years, a number of changes to the pricing and reimbursement system have been successfully introduced in Ireland. These have resulted in reductions in the prices of thousands of medicines.  Following intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA), the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.  It will deliver a number of important benefits, including: significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs; a lowering of the drugs bill to the State; timely access for patients to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions; and reducing the cost base of the health system into the future.<\/p><p>  The gross savings arising from this deal will be in excess of &euro;400m over 3 years. &euro;210 million from the gross savings will make available new drugs to patients over 3 years. Thus, the deal will result in a net reduction in the HSE expenditure on drugs of about &euro;190m.  The Department of Health and the HSE have also successfully finalised discussions with the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland (APMI), which represent the generic industry, on a new agreement to deliver further savings in the cost of generic drugs. It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013.  The IPHA agreement provides that prices are referenced to the currency adjusted average price to wholesaler in the nominated EU member states in which the medicine is then available.  The prices of a range of medicines are due to be reduced on 1 January next in accordance with the agreement.  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Bill provides that when the HSE is setting a reference price for, or reviewing a reference price set for, a relevant group of interchangeable medicinal products it shall take into account the following criteria: the ability of suppliers to meet patient demand for the relevant item; the value for money afforded by the relevant item; the equivalent prices of the relevant item in all other Member States where the product is marketed; the prices of therapeutically similar items; and the resources available to the HSE.<\/p><p>  It is important to balance achieving best value for money for the taxpayer with assuring continuity of supply for critical medical products, particularly in a small market like Ireland. Consequently, the Bill aims to achieve value for money while avoiding disruption in the availability of medicines on the Irish market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Staff","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC00450"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[57097\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 530 of 11 December 2012, if he is satisfied that he has no obligation to ensure detailed consultation and full engagement between the Health Service Executive, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation on issues that impact on their members; if he does have an obligation in this regard if has he fulfilled this obligation with regards to proposed new access protocols for 16 and 17 year olds to mental health services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[57031\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 530 of 11 December 2012, if he is satisfied that he has no obligation to ensure detailed consultation and full engagement between the Health Service Executive, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation in issues that impact on their members; if he does have an obligation in this regard if has he fulfilled this obligation with regards to proposed new access protocols for 16 and 17 year olds to mental health services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 48 together.<\/p><p>  The issues raised by the Deputies are matters in relation to which the HSE has specific statutory obligations.

Before those trusts are established the make-up and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed. <\/p><p>  With specific regard to the South East, I have stated on numerous occasions recently that Waterford Regional Hospital will remain as one of the 8 existing national cancer care programme centres, with the same population referral base for cancer patients and with all of the associated services required to support this, such as joint consultant appointments (e.g. general surgery shared with Wexford).  I have also reiterated that other services currently provided in Waterford, such as invasive cardiology and trauma services will continue to be provided there. The provision of services at any hospital site will, of course, primarily be determined by the appropriate clinical programme for that service, taking account of the population which the hospital serves and services provided by other hospitals which are within a reasonable commute.<\/p><p>  Last June I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups. The Strategic Board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions. A Project Team was established to make recommendations to the Strategic Board on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions. <\/p><p>  The Project Team is currently finalising a Report on the recommendations outlined above, taking account of the observations and comments made by the Strategic Board and of issues which have been raised in submissions by a number of key stakeholders. The report is to be presented formally to me in early January. I will consider it  and I will have any further consultation I require carried out as a matter of urgency. The report will then be presented to Government for decision on the  composition of hospital groups in light of the recommendations of the Report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":83,"content":"<p>Question No. 34 answered with Question No. 30.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Accommodation","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[57076\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of bed closures in acute hospitals to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, I have asked the Health Service to respond directly to the Deputy in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Investigations","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC01650"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[57025\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900066#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will reconsider his rejection of the call by a person (details supplied) for a full public inquiry into the tragic death of their spouse at Galway Regional Hospital on 28 October 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":89,"content":"<p>At a Press Conference on 19th November the Health Service Executive (HSE) gave details of the Investigation Team which is being chaired by an international expert in obstetrics and gynaecology, Professor Sir Sabaratnam Arulkumaran.

The SDU was set up immediately following the Minister&rsquo;s appointment and the initial focus for the SDU's Scheduled Care Team has been on waiting times for in-patient and daycase elective surgery.  For children, the target is that by the end of 2012 no child should be waiting for inpatient or daycase treatment for more than 20 weeks. Huge progress has been made towards this target &ndash; on 13 December, there were just 234 children waiting longer than 20 weeks compared with 1,759 at the end of December 2011.  Improving access to outpatient services is the next priority for the Government. Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the NTPF has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  A maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013.  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.

The Sligo Town facility will be located at Nazareth House; this project is expected to commence in 2013 and its completion date is estimated at 2014.   <\/p><p>  Using the leasing initiative the HSE has delivered primary care infrastructure at 29 locations.  The HSE is continuing its collaboration  with the private sector to progress suitable locations.  Information on locations progressing will be published in the Executive's 2013 National Service Plan.<\/p><p>  The current position with regard to the PPP initiative for primary care infrastructure, the current position is that the HSE is engaging with the NDFA as required to progress the programme. The HSE is currently analysing the available sites in each location and engaging with the GPs in each location to determine their interest in participating in the primary care centre development.  The HSE has commenced the procurement of design teams and technical advisors to progress the design and planning submissions for the primary care centre sites and the preparation of the PPP procurement documents.   Up to 20 of the 35 locations announced will be offered to the market subject to a) agreement between the local GPs and the HSE on active local GP involvement in the centres and b) site suitability and availability. While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual 20 potential locations, it is expected that these primary care centres will be completed in 2016.<\/p><p>  Work is underway on the Executive's multi-annual Capital Plan 2013-2017.  The draft Plan will be submitted to my Department in due course.  My Department will then review the proposals and follow up with the HSE where further details may be required.   The draft Capital Plan 2013-2017 will require my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Professional Qualifications","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[56887\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress that has been made on introducing regulations for psychotherapists and counsellors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>The Health and Social Care Professionals Council (the Council) and the 12 registration boards to be established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (the Act) are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals.

Under UHI, every individual will be insured and will have equal access to a standard package of primary and acute hospital services, including acute mental health services.  A new Insurance Fund will subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for a subsidy. The new UHI system will be underpinned by a robust legislative  framework and grounded in principles of open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating  .  <\/p><p>  In moving to a system of UHI,  there are  a number of key stepping stones  that are necessary to  pave the way for the introduction of universal health insurance including: the strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients; the work of the Special Delivery Unit in tackling waiting times and establishing hospital groups, and the introduction of a more transparent and efficient &quot;Money Follows the Patient&quot; funding mechanism for hospitals. <\/p><p>The reform programme is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and sequencing over a number of years. The Programme for Government acknowledges that full implementation of UHI will take some time to achieve. Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2016   highlights the importance of a step-by-step evidence-based approach to achieving an effective, equitable and efficient system. Work on the critical building blocks is underway and it is anticipated that by 2016 much of the necessary groundwork will be in place to ensure that we are well placed to  proceed with  implementation of UHI. <\/p><p>  Finally, in designing the future UHI system and associated legal and regulatory framework, it is important to acknowledge that, as is the case with all countries, we must make choices in meeting healthcare demands with finite resources.  This involves legitimate policy choices to be debated and resolved as part of the democratic process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[56891\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of ambulance calls responded to by the Health Service Executive National Ambulance Service in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; the average time it takes to successfully deliver a patient to hospital from the point a call is made for the same periods; the number of ambulances available during the same period listed by location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD01850"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[57011\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the Health Service Executive funding or other resources allocated to or paid for services to a nursing home (details supplied) in County Wicklow in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1022","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cost of Drugs","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[57005\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900067#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his estimate of the savings to be made in 2013 from the agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p> the HSE and the Department of Health, a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State was concluded in October last.

First, the asset contribution will be increased from 5% to 7.5% per annum.  This will be capped at three years, or 22.5%, in the case of the principal private residence.  This change will apply to new and existing nursing home residents.  However, for existing residents, it should be noted that, in the case of the principal private residence, the higher percentage will only apply for the time remaining of the three-year cap.  In the case of all other assets, it will apply for as long as the person remains in receipt of financial support under the scheme.  Second, the entitlement for State support to be backdated to 27 October 2009 for people who were in nursing home care prior to the scheme commencing will be abolished.  It is important to note that the legislation underpinning the scheme must be amended before these measures can be implemented.  Therefore, an effective date will be announced in 2013.  Finally, the review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will proceed as planned.  A considerable amount of preparatory work for the review has already been completed.  It will progress within the constraints of available staff and other priorities.

The European Union is working actively to support efforts to bring peace and stability to the country, and this will remain an important foreign policy priority for the EU during Ireland&rsquo;s forthcoming Presidency of the European Council in the first half of 2013.<\/p><p>  The Democratic Republic of Congo has been ravaged by a long series of violent conflicts.  Millions of innocent civilians have been killed, injured or displaced from their homes and there have been systematic abuses of human rights, extremely high levels of sexual violence, and widespread recruitment and use of child soldiers.  The latest upsurge in violence, since the early summer, has been driven by the so-called M23 group which has been responsible for a campaign of violence which has caused many deaths and significant displacement and trauma.  The EU has repeatedly called on the M23 to end its campaign of violence and we have also condemned and called for an end to external support for the group.<\/p><p>  The EU is playing a constructive and significant role in ongoing efforts to deal with the crisis.  Developments in the DRC are regularly discussed by EU Foreign Ministers.  We adopted strong formal Conclusions on the situation in the DRC at the Foreign Affairs Council in November and again more recently on 10 December.  We are supporting the African Union and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region which are taking the lead on efforts to end the conflict in the eastern DRC.  The EU is also providing a programme of support for the DRC authorities aimed at strengthening their capacities to promote better governance and the rule of law. This programme focuses on institutional reform and democracy, physical infrastructure and security sector reform, including within the Congolese Armed Forces. <\/p><p>  Historically, Ireland has played its part in working for peace and justice in the DRC.  In recent years, we have focused in particular on providing support for the humanitarian response to the conflict.  So far this year, Ireland has provided some &euro;8.23 million in humanitarian support, including &euro;3.5 million allocated this month to the Common Humanitarian Fund, a UN-administered fund which is allocated to projects by the resident UN Humanitarian Coordinator in the DRC.  In addition, Irish Aid has also provided funds to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for its work to coordinate the delivery of humanitarian assistance across the country. Further funding has been made available to NGO partners such as Concern, Christian Aid and Oxfam.  Earlier this month, these three NGOs also benefitted from an emergency airlift of humanitarian supplies in response to the serious situation in North Kivu in the eastern DRC, with 18,000 blankets, 600 tarpaulins and 500 tents dispatched from Irish Aid&rsquo;s pre-positioned stocks in Dubai to help those displaced by the recent fighting. <\/p><p>  A very strong focus of our concern and attention in the DRC is, and will remain, on the human rights situation.

As well as regular reviews of the overall country situation, there has been a very specific focus on mapping human rights violations during conflict and on the phenomenon of sexual violence and its impact on victims.  The Government is committed to working with other members of the Human Rights Council, and with the DRC authorities, during our membership term to highlight human rights issues in the DRC and to support efforts to ensure respect for and protection of human rights in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900070#WRG02100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900070#WRG02150"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[57271\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900070#WRG02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will allocate additional overseas development aid to assist the humanitarian relief efforts in Syria and in surrounding countries in view of the fact that the crisis in Syria has intensified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>The appalling suffering of the Syrian civilian population over the last twenty one months is of deep concern to Ireland. Since the uprising in Syria began in March 2011 an estimated 40,000 people have been killed in the violence. Over 2.5 million people inside Syria are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance, with 1.2 million people displaced inside the country. The number of registered refugees from Syria in the region has now passed half a million. This has placed enormous pressure on Syria&rsquo;s neighbours, who have made commendable efforts to host the refugee population and respond proactively and generously to their needs.<\/p><p>  Ireland too has responded swiftly to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and in neighbouring countries. As early as March 2012 we provided &euro;500,000 in emergency funding for the ICRC, UNHCR and the World Food Programme. In August I visited Jordan and witnessed firsthand the huge strain that the refugee population is placing on the host countries, both in relation to the refugee camps and also the host communities. Since then Ireland has provided additional support of &euro;1,750,000 to UN agencies and NGO partners who are providing life saving medical assistance to Syrians both in Syria and neighbouring countries. Irish assistance also included supplies of non-food items from our stocks in Dubai. A contribution of &euro;200,000 to UNRWA for Palestinian refugees caught up in the conflict brings Ireland&rsquo;s total response to the crisis to &euro;2,450,000.<\/p><p>  Ireland also understands that while this is a humanitarian crisis, it is driven by politics and will only be solved with a political solution. From the beginning, Ireland has recognised this, striving to respond to the humanitarian needs of the populations affected by the violence whilst working simultaneously for a sustainable political solution, based on accommodating the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Syrian people. Ireland has worked for a unified international response and has particularly encouraged the members of the UN Security Council to live up to its responsibilities and show leadership in relation to the crisis, primarily through adoption of a new, strong Security Council Resolution. <\/p><p>We continue to strongly support the efforts of the UN\/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to promote a political settlement. An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Eamon Gilmore, T.D. was very pleased to meet with Mr. Brahimi during the recent OSCE ministerial meeting in Dublin where he also met with Secretary of State Clinton and Foreign Minister Lavrov. Ireland has also participated actively within the framework of the Friends of Syria Group, which includes my own attendance at the most recent meeting of the group last week in Marrakesh.  <\/p><p>  Ireland has provided significant support to those in need as a result of this crisis.

Significant resources and efforts have also been put into reducing volumes and improving processing times for appellants to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.

This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900075#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":387,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900075#WRM01150"},{"type":"question","counter":388,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[57189\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900075#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the proposals he intends bringing before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to combat the illegal exploitation of women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":389,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is referring to exploitation in the form of sex trafficking.   <\/p><p>  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 criminalises the trafficking of persons for the purposes of sexual exploitation.

Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation.  Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<\/p><p>  &quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland.  Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon. That is no longer the case. The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.<\/p><p>  There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution.  While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement.  It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;   <\/p><p>  The Minister added that:  <\/p><p>&quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole.  It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course.  Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so.  It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.<\/p><p>  My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document. The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.   <\/p><p>  This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence.  Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate.  I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received.  I expect it is likely that the Committee&rsquo;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.   <\/p><p>  I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;   <\/p><p>  The discussion document will be made available on the Department&rsquo;s website, www.justice.ie   <\/p><p>  This discussion document does not favour any particular approach but simply tries to assist reflection.

Work on the preparation of the legislation is proceeding as a priority and the intention is that the Agency will be established in early 2013.  In order to inform the content of the legislation the Government has decided that upon establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have responsibility for a range of services.

It is my intention that the Agency will be as broadly based as possible and that it should include those services that might, in the first instance, help prevent problems arising for a family, that would identify problems and provide supports at an early stage, and, that would assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised interventions beyond their own resources.

The allocations are distributed to the youth projects through 39 administering agencies\/bodies that hold funding administration status. These include VECs, national youth organisations and 11 other bodies including some county councils. <\/p><p>  My Department is examining the scope for streamlining the tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of funding. From January 2013, it is proposed to transfer the administration of the allocated funding  involving six national organisations to the City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB). These six national bodies are currently responsible for administering funding to some 30 youth projects on behalf of my Department. <\/p><p>  CDYSB is a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin VEC.  The CDYSB, on behalf of CDVEC, has for several years, undertaken the administration of some 50 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.   The initiative is subject to the successful completion of a service level agreement between my Department and the CDVEC and discussions are ongoing with CDYSB at present.  <\/p><p>  The proposed revised administration process will be monitored during 2013 for efficiency and effectiveness for the Department and for the projects concerned. Subject to a successful transition to the new system it is proposed that consideration will be given to further streamlining financial processing arrangements in 2014.<\/p><p>  It is envisaged that the successful streamlining of the administration of the funding for the youth projects will deliver benefits in terms of saving on the administration costs incurred under the present arrangements and efficiencies for both the Department and projects themselves. <\/p><p>Every effort is being made my Department to ensure that, in the administration of the funding allocations in the present challenging budgetary situation, the focus is maintained on the provision of the front line services for young people. The VECs have a statutory role in the provision of youth services and further legislative provision to continue this important function is contained in the Education and Training Boards Bill, 2012. Indeed it would be the hope of the Department that, in reducing the administrative burden in relation to the funding of projects, the role of youth officers, in supporting youth projects in the delivery of a quality youth service to young people, would be strengthened. The VECs will continue to receive funding from the Department in respect of this valued role including for the costs of the youth officers employed by them.   <\/p><p>  My Department will communicate further and hold discussions about the proposals for change with the VECs and other organisations that administer funding on its behalf during the course of 2013.

It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.<\/p><p>  The Department and the HSE are currently examining the changes that need to be made to the GMS contract to facilitate the introduction of Universal Primary Care.<\/p><p>The Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Act 2012 came into effect on 12th March 2012.  The Act provides for the elimination of restrictions on GPs wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the GMS Scheme by opening up access to all fully qualified and vocationally trained GPs.  By 30th November 2012, 97 GPs had been granted a GMS contract by the HSE under the provisions of the Act.  33 further applications are currently being processed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900079#WRQ01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":548,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900079#WRQ01450"},{"type":"question","counter":549,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[57359\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900079#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will instruct all hospitals to abolish catchment areas, publish the waiting time for all consultants and publish the efficiency measurements of all hospitals in view of the fact that this will allow general practitioners to refer to the most efficient hospitals and drive the concept of money follows the patient; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1095","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":550,"content":"<p>The Deputy has raised a number of issues with regard to hospitals. <\/p><p>  In relation to the collection of waiting time data, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) collects information on (a) hospital in-patients and day case waiting times and (b) outpatient waiting times.  In relation to in-patient and daycases, information on the median (average) waiting time in each hospital for the top surgical procedures on the waiting list is published on the NTPF website.  In regard to outpatients, the numbers of patients waiting for a first appointment at a consultant-led clinic, by hospital, by time band are published and available on the NTPF website and through the HSE Performance Reports.  HIQA's Tallaght Hospital Investigation Report 2012 recommended the benchmarking and publication of outpatient department (OPD) appointment wait times across all hospitals at a national, regional, local and consultant level. National, regional and local wait times are now available and I am advised by the NTPF that it is the intention to publish consultant level waiting time during the course of 2013\/14.  In relation to the efficiency of hospitals, the HSE currently publishes two separate monthly reports addressing the efficiency of all hospitals.  The Performance Report is a monthly report published on the HSE website and it details performance against the HSE Service Plan and contains some hospital level information.  HealthStat is a comprehensive databank of performance information which provides detailed monthly results from hospitals and from Local Health Offices responsible for providing health and social care services in the community.  The results are also published on the HSE website.<\/p><p>  In 2013, HealthStat will be replaced by CompStat, which is a performance management and reporting system which will operate on a monthly cycle.  It is built around a balanced accountability framework of Quality, Access and Resources wherein each HSE Region will be the locus of control.  It supports the migration towards autonomous hospital groups and incorporates a score-card performance report on a suite of relevant metrics.  CompStat will focus on Acute Hospitals metrics from an In-patient, Out-patient and Day-case perspective and on Community metrics from a Local Health Office representative of all care groups perspective.  CompStat will deliver higher quality efficiency measurements for all hospitals and community services.<\/p><p>  The Programme for Government commits to introducing a prospective-based &quot;Money Follows the Patient&quot; (MFTP) funding system to replace the current block grant allocation system.  Under MFTP, hospitals will be encouraged to provide services more efficiently and will be paid on a fair and transparent basis for the needs they address, the quantity and quality of the services they provide and the outcomes they deliver. They will be liberated, subject to overall budgetary ceilings, to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving this standard of performance. A Hospital Financing Subgroup, established under the auspices of the Universal Health Insurance Implementation Group, has prepared draft policy and implementation proposals, and these are currently being considered by the Minister.<\/p><p>  With regard to catchment areas, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900079#WRQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":552,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900079#WRQ01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900079#WRQ01650"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[57296\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900079#WRQ01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide in tabular form, the total amount of capital funding his Department has allocated to Waterford for the years 2011 and 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1092","askee":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Industry","counter":553,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900079#WRQ01850"},{"type":"question","counter":554,"qnumday":207,"qnumall":"[57302\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121900079#WRQ01900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the potential in the hostel tourism both nationally and internationally; if he will consider developing this industry in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":555,"content":"<p>The matter raised is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.
