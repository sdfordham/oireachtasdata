Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.

These improvements are reflected in the VPSJ report in that households with pre-school children moved into income adequacy (as defined in the report) as a result of increases in child benefit and the introduction of free GP care for children under the age of six.  In addition, the increase in the weekly rate of payment for pensioners aged 66 and over moved pensioners living alone in receipt of the State pension contributory into income adequacy while pensioner couples on welfare payments have, per the research, levels of income in excess of the minimum standard for many years.<\/p>  <p>  The analysis in the VPSJ report is a valuable contribution to our future consideration of appropriate levels of income supports and services.  I note the importance of better services such a free GP care for younger children outlined in the report.<\/p>  <p>  Analysis in the Social Inclusion Monitor, 2014, published by my Department shows the crucial role that Ireland&rsquo;s social protection system plays in alleviating poverty, cushioning people from the worst effects of unemployment and ensuring an adequate standard of living.<\/p>  <p>  Using Eurostat data for 2014, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate in Ireland from 37.2% to 15.6%, thereby lifting over a fifth of the population out of income poverty.  Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers.  The poverty reduction effect at 58.9% is the highest in Europe, almost twice the EU average.<\/p>  <p>  The latest poverty data are for 2014 and do not fully reflect the impact of the recovery in economic growth and employment.  The unemployment rate in 2014 was 11.3%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.  Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen further, to 7.8% in May 2016.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect to see further decreases in basic deprivation and consistent poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work Strategy 2016-2020 sets out comprehensive plans to increase labour market participation and make work pay.  It continues to prioritise the activation of the long-term and young unemployed people, with supports provided through the network of Intreo offices. <\/p>  <p>  A range of welfare and income tax measures were introduced in Budget 2016 to further incentivise work and improve living standards.  The social impact assessment of the Budget shows greater rewards for working, with over 80% of the unemployed substantially better-off in work.<\/p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the new Programme for a Partnership Government contains a number of significant commitments to enhance the welfare system in the years ahead.  This includes increasing rent supplement limits by up to 15% and I note the impact of housing costs included in the VPSJ report.  I hope to announce changes to the rent supplement scheme operated by my Department very shortly.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make progress on the welfare commitments contained in the Programme for Government in the forthcoming Budget and will seek to do this within the additional resources which will be available.<\/p>  <p>  I also look forward to engagement and input from my colleagues in the Oireachtas in the matter.

Eligibility is not dependent upon the recipient retiring from employment, and there is no retirement pension.<\/p>  <p>  The SPC is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions estimated an annual cost of backdating the Home-maker's scheme, at that time, as &euro;150 million (if to 1973) or &euro;160 million (if to 1953).  However it described those estimates as &ldquo;extremely tentative&rdquo; and the passage of time means that the potential cost now could be significantly higher.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  The Review also examined the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment which were to be introduced in September 2012.  The Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that the &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; describes a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As employees in the public service generally paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which provided no cover for the State pension (contributory), the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  Instead, by impacting upon their continuing public service employment, the marriage bar&rsquo;s pension implications, where they exist, more generally relate to a person&rsquo;s eventual entitlement to a Public Service pension.  Any questions regarding this issue are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.  The position of women who were home-makers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>  <p>  Any significant measures that would increase the cost of the State pension would have to be considered in the context of Budget discussions. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000058#WRA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Services Programme","counter":44,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000058#WRA03150"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[18798\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000058#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to accept new proposals to the community services programme; the criteria that would be used to select new proposals; if he has a preference for particular types of programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>The community services programme (CSP) is designed to address gaps in the delivery of key local services, to tackle disadvantage and to ensure that community facilities are utilised.

The target is to lift over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020.

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that earlier this month, the grant, increased to &euro;1,700 in Budget 2016, issued automatically, to carers in receipt of Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance or Prescribed Relative's Allowance.  The CSG is also payable, in certain circumstances, to other carers who may still apply through my Department&rsquo;s stand-alone RCG section.  It is expected that in excess of 90,000 grants will be paid in 2016 at an estimated cost of &euro;157.6 million. <\/p>  <p>  Conscious of the reports of the Ombudsman regarding the legal status of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts, the Government decided to close both schemes.  In addition the Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by my colleague the Minister for Health. <\/p>  <p>  Monthly payments continue to be made by the Health Service Executive to the 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time the scheme closed in 2013.  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000060#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Placement Programmes","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000060#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[18689\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000060#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to consider the possibility of introducing more flexibility to the T&uacute;s work placement initiative scheme, including considering extending the period of time a person can avail of the scheme on case-by-case basis, with particular consideration given to a person's age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":112,"content":"<p>T&uacute;s was set up to provide short-term, work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.

The Authority provides a wide range of information and guidance to help and support trustees to comply with their regulatory obligations as set out under legislation.  The Authority, in consultation with my Department, is continually assessing governance issues and making improvements in order to protect the members of pension schemes.   <\/p>  <p>  For example, the Authority has introduced trustee training obligations where trustees must receive training in governance matters to improve the quality of trusteeship.  It further introduced a Pensions Data Register where since 2011 some one million data submissions have been processed through the system.  The Authority has published a comprehensive series of model documents for trustees and administrators.<\/p>  <p>  The Authority has outlined plans for improved pension scheme governance in their Statement of Strategy 2016-2020 where it intends to further target areas such as governance and obligations of stakeholders by providing codes of conduct and models of best practice.<\/p>  <p>  On the wider EU level Ireland has implemented the first EU Directive 2003\/41\/EC on the Activities and Supervision of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPS).  The IORPS Directive established the basic EU requirements for occupational pension funds and their supervision, including rules obliging schemes to invest their assets prudently.  Ireland has also been centrally involved in discussions on the revision of the IORPS Directive - IORPS II.  The IORPS II Directive is anticipated to be approved by member states shortly and Ireland will have a two year timescale to transpose the Directive into Irish law.  It is anticipated that the proposed revisions, which Ireland supports, will provide for, and improve, minimum standards in the areas of scheme governance requirements, e.g., new structures for risk management and evaluation, internal audit, internal control and remuneration.  It may also include new requirements regarding &lsquo;fit and proper&rsquo; management standards in schemes and the safekeeping of assets.

Other financial services companies and firms are also located throughout Dublin and in other centres around the country so there are a range of options for firms considering Ireland as a base.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Currently about 3.5 million square feet of office space is under construction.\u00a0 It should also be noted that of this 3.5 million square feet, at least 1 million square foot is pre-let with legal contracts exchanged with a further 600k square feet formally reserved.<\/p>  <p>  Annual office take up last year was c. 2.6 million square feet and expected take up in 2016 estimated at around 2million square feet.<\/p>  <p>  Figures provided by the IDA forecast that there is approximately 5.2 million square feet of grade A office space due for delivery by end of 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  We will continue, through the IDA, to promote the attractiveness of Ireland as a location of choice for investment and talent.\u00a0 This is based on our unique competitive strengths and our position as an English-speaking country in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Naturally, there may be new opportunities arising for Ireland in certain sectors, many of which already form part of the IDA's marketing strategy.\u00a0 We will, for example, continue to implement our clear strategy for driving growth in the financial services sector and we will maximise any opportunities that might arise.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Central Bank had considered the potential financial regulatory resource implications of a UK vote to leave the EU.\u00a0 At present, the Central Bank Commission is satisfied that it has the resources required to regulate the financial sector.\u00a0 I am confident based on the Central Bank's ability to significantly expand its regulatory resources in the last seven years that it is capable of doing so again in order to properly supervise and regulate additional financial service activity that may relocate to Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000063#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pensions Data","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000063#WRF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[19015\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000063#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of approved retirement funds in operation; the value of funds held in these; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":217,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[19016\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000063#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the value of pension buy-out bonds in the Irish markets that may now qualify for approved retirement fund options; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":218,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.<\/p>  <p>  Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) are investment vehicles into which the proceeds of the pension savings of the self-employed, business owners and any individual with Defined Contribution pension arrangements may be invested at retirement, subject to conditions.  Beneficial ownership of the assets in an ARF vests in the individual owner of the ARF and, among other conditions, the ARF must be managed by an independent Qualifying Fund Manager.  The ARF option is an alternative to annuity purchase and essentially gives control over post-retirement income to those individuals who, generally, have borne the investment risk on their funds in the pension growth phase.<\/p>  <p>  A Buy-out Bond, otherwise known as a Personal Retirement Bond, is a single premium pension policy into which an existing pension fund or the cash value of an accrued pension benefit can be transferred from a Defined Contribution (DC) or Defined Benefit (DB) occupational pension scheme.  Buy-out Bonds are generally effected by the trustees of a scheme on behalf of a scheme member when the scheme member is leaving the employment of the scheme-sponsor or when the scheme is being wound-up, in lieu of providing the member with a preserved retirement benefit under the scheme.  They are also availed of in circumstances where the scheme member's pension entitlements are being split under the terms of a pension adjustment order.  Buy-out Bonds are usually provided and administered by life assurance companies.<\/p>  <p>  There is no requirement on Qualifying Fund Managers or on life assurance companies to provide my Department or the Revenue Commissioners with detailed data of the kind requested in the questions in relation to ARFs or Buy-Out Bonds.  I am, therefore, not in a position to supply the Deputy with information on the current numbers or values of such products.<\/p>  <p>  I am assuming that the questions raised by the Deputy have been prompted by the change which I announced last week whereby the holders of Buy-out Bonds whose funds originate from DB schemes will from now on have access to the ARF option.  Buy-out Bonds whose transfer values originate from DB schemes have not had access to the ARF option up to now and the only option available to the holder of a Bond in those circumstances has been to purchase a pension annuity with the remaining funds in the Bond (after taking the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum).\u00a0 Buy-out Bonds are DC pension products, however, and whether funded originally from DB or DC pension schemes, the holders of such Bonds bear the investment risk on their funds in the same way as holders of other DC pension savings who would have access to the ARF option as well as the annuity purchase option at retirement. <\/p>  <p>  The ARF option is not available to the main benefits paid from DB pension schemes, generally, since it was never intended or considered a necessary requirement for such schemes which pay out a specified pension benefit.  This position remains unchanged. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My decision to change the policy on ARF access for the holders of Buy-out Bonds whose funds originate from DB schemes has been particularly informed by the increasing frequency over recent years of the wind-up of DB pension schemes, with the members of such schemes having no choice in many cases but to accept a transfer to a Buy-out Bond and inevitable annuity purchase on retirement.  The policy change will be of particular benefit to individuals in this situation.  The Deputy should note that there is no Exchequer cost involved as a result of this change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000063#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000063#WRF02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools Scheme","counter":219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000063#WRF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":220,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[18837\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000063#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way a new action plan will affect a school from applying for Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools status under proposals from his Department's action plans for disadvantage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1265","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":221,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the review of the DEIS programme is currently underway and it is my intention that a New Action Plan Educational Inclusion will be published by the end of this year. <\/p><p>  The current DEIS Action Plan, was published in 2005 and now provides support to 836 schools serving a total of 169,500 pupils.

However, the formal notification to schools cannot be made until the allocation process is finalised for all schools.  <\/p><p>The provision of allocations in June ensures that schools have sufficient time to plan for the provision of supports in advance of September 2016.

The order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply.  In making determination orders, the RTB can make provision to allow for payment of awards in instalments to facilitate recovery of the award, based on the circumstances of the case.  A party who fails to comply with one or more terms of a determination order is open to having legal proceedings taken against him or her in the Courts.<\/p><p>Under the Act, enforcement of RTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their sixteenth and sixty-sixth birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that the &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; describes a rule that existed in most of the public service and some private sector employments, where women were required to leave their employment upon marriage.  This practice was abolished in 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC.  As employees in the public service generally paid a reduced rate of PRSI, which provided no cover for the State pension (contributory), the marriage bar would not generally have impacted on State pension entitlement, as they would not have qualified for that payment had they remained in public sector employment.  Instead, by impacting upon their continuing public service employment, the marriage bar&rsquo;s pension implications, where they exist, more generally relate to a person&rsquo;s eventual entitlement to a Public Service pension.  Questions on this are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives may not qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;, under which, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical components to be put in place prior its implementation.

In doing so it is hoped to promote competitiveness and productivity.<\/p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment has fallen substantially to 15% in May 2016.  This compares with a figure of almost 21% just one year ago, in May 2015, and with a peak level of over 31% in May 2012.<\/p><p>Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate the young unemployed back into work.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).<\/p><p>The key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s policy response to the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement by case officers with young people to assist them to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  Where young people do not find work relatively quickly, additional supports may be offered, both through reserved places on existing employment and training schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015 (see Table 1 to this reply).<\/p><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and further commits to a number of additional measures.  These include increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.<\/p><p>I am confident these measures, and continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment to add to the substantial improvements that have already been seen over the last few years. <\/p><p><b>Table 1.

The group explored the necessity for and the implications of legislating with regard to a number of issues, including in relation to granting a right of access to private lands by recreational users.<\/p>  <p>  The group reported in May 2007 and the then Minister formed the view that the most appropriate way forward was to continue on the basis of a permissive access regime with the agreement of landholders via initiatives such as the Walks Scheme and the Pilot Mountain Access Projects.  These initiatives continue to be successfully implemented on the ground by a team of Rural Recreation Officers, employed by Local Development Companies.<\/p>  <p>  The consensus approach adopted is underpinned by the principle of mutual respect between landowners and recreation users, with the acceptance of the rights of landowners on the one hand and the need of recreation users to have reasonable access to the countryside on the other.

The Directive establishes a framework for cross border healthcare between EU\/EEA states to facilitate patients to access care in another Member State in accordance with their entitlements in their own country.  Under the Directive, known as the Cross Border Healthcare Directive (CBD), insured patients are entitled to have the costs of cross-border healthcare services reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation.  As such, it allows Irish residents to avail of healthcare in other EU or EEA (excluding Switzerland) Member States that they would be entitled to within the public health system in Ireland, which is not contrary to Irish legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The result of the recent EU Referendum in the UK means that the UK electorate have declared their wish to leave the EU.

Irish patients who had planned to travel to the UK under the CBD in the near future may continue to do as planned.<\/p>  <p>  The terms of a British exit from the EU are unknown at this stage.  It is expected to take a minimum of two years of negotiations between all EU member states, including Ireland, to agree a new arrangement between the UK and the EU, and the Department of Health will be fully involved in these negotiations.

This Group&rsquo;s remit was to address these challenges facing the sector under themes such as biosecurity, animal welfare, quality assurance, antibiotic usage, animal health, salmonella control programme, marketing, feed, non-intensive sector and other production models.  This was a very comprehensive exercise stretching over many months which also included a public consultation phase during which submissions were received and presented to the Committee by many different stakeholders.

International research has shown that deer as a species are not particularly effective as maintenance hosts for TB except when numbers are high.  An exercise conducted in 2007-2008 in an area with known TB infection in deer, focussed on identifying the strains of TB in cattle, deer and badgers, found a significantly higher prevalence of the disease in badgers than in either cattle or deer.<\/p><p>I would note that responsibility for the management of wild deer in the State under the Wildlife Acts rests with the Minister for of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the control of deer on private property is the responsibility of individual landowners.  Landowners may apply to the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht for permission under section 42\u00a0of\u00a0the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where\u00a0this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.<\/p><p>In an effort to address concerns around the linkage between TB and deer, my Department in consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service has conducted post-mortem sampling of deer carcasses for the presence of TB in the Calary area of Co. Wicklow where relatively high levels of TB in deer has been reported.  The project also involves identifying the strains of TB for comparison with that found in cattle and badgers in that specific area.  Mindful of the commitment in the Programme for Partnership Government to address individual TB blackspots, further consultations have recently taken place between officials of the two Departments to further this work and a range of options are currently being considered.<\/p><p><font color=\"#222222\">  Additionally, it should be noted that hunters supplying wild game to Approved Game Handling Establishments (AGHEs) must be trained in animal health and hygiene relevant to wild game.  By law, hunters must report suspicion of contagious disease (e.g. TB in deer) to the relevant competent authority, either my Department or the Local Authority Veterinary Service (LAVS). <\/font>Based on existing evidence, from AGHEs and reports from trained hunters, TB levels in wild deer are, with the exception of Co.

As set out in 'A Programme for a Partnership Government', our objective is to protect our national competitiveness from unsustainable cost growth and to deliver a job-fit business environment which ranks in the top tier globally.<\/p>  <p>  The Costs of Doing Business Report published by the National Competitiveness Council on April 21st provides an assessment of Ireland's cost competitiveness performance vis-a-vis a range of competitor countries.  The report, which has been noted by Government, concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, transport, energy, water, waste, communications, credit \/financial, and business service.  It finds that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years. This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.  However, despite these improvements, Ireland remains a relatively high cost location for a range of key business inputs and there is upward cost pressure evident in the market for commercial insurance.  The report is a timely reminder of the risks of complacency regarding our cost competitiveness.  To protect the gains achieved to date, to sustain the recovery, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our cost competitiveness.  The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business report and the associated reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be brought to Government and published later this year.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance costs are relevant to businesses of all sizes and in all sectors of the economy.  In general insurance costs account for a relatively low proportion of the overall enterprise cost base.  While insurance costs represent a minor component of enterprise operating costs, premium increases can have an impact on costs, particularly for SMEs and micro enterprises.  Under EU law, the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited.  While the provision and the pricing of insurance policies is a commercial matter for insurance companies, competitive and transparent markets are vital. <\/p>  <p>  While my Department has no role in the supervision or regulation of insurance, which is a policy and supervisory matter for the Department of Finance and the Central Bank respectively, last year, the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) considered the commercial insurance market in Ireland as part of its 2015 Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2015 report.  It subsequently set out a range of potential actions which could help facilitate enhanced cost competitiveness in the non-life commercial insurance market.  These were set out in its Competitiveness Challenge 2015 report.  The Council concluded that the absence of price data makes it very difficult to assess market conditions and competitiveness in the non-life insurance market.  The Council subsequently recommended that responsibility for improving insurance cost competitiveness of commercial insurance must be clearly assigned and accorded sufficient priority by policymakers and there is a need to comprehensively benchmark insurance costs and the drivers of costs in Ireland with costs in our key competitors.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance is currently examining the factors which contribute to increasing costs of insurance.  This work is part of an overall review of policy in the insurance sector which that Department is carrying out in consultation with the Central Bank and other Departments, Agencies and external stakeholders.  My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Finance in their ongoing work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UK Referendum on EU Membership","counter":744,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV00550"},{"type":"question","counter":745,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[18982\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the immediate contingency steps she will take following the recent decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":746,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[18983\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the immediate contingency steps IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will take following the recent decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":747,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[18984\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV00800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the immediate contingency steps she will take to safeguard Irish exports and associated jobs following the recent decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[18985\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the immediate contingency steps she will take with respect to trade policy and upcoming trade missions following the recent decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":749,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[18986\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the areas and sectors in which the greatest risks are likely to arise and which will need immediate focus when future negotiations begin following the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[18987\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the potential impact on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations of the recent decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":751,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 to 270, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the UK decision will not take effect for some time and that the precise implications of the referendum result will now depend on the period of negotiation ahead, involving the UK and our EU partners.<\/p><p>As indicated by the Taoiseach in his statement last Friday, the Government has adopted an initial Contingency Framework to map out the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming weeks and months.

His letter also highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s continued strong offering in relation to talent, ease of doing business, a competitive and transparent taxation regime, English-speaking and, critically, Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to the EU market.<\/p><p>Mr. Shanahan has also engaged with international media to highlight that Ireland is very much open for business with full European Union market access.<\/p><p>Ireland will be working closely with the UK and other EU member States to ensure that any potential disruption to trade and investment is minimised. <\/p><p>We will continue to support the EU in creating open markets and will endeavour to ensure that our interests are to the fore in future negotiations with the UK.  Ireland will continue to make the most effective use of the framework of bilateral trade agreements and multi-sectoral trade agreements that the EU already has in place under the World Trade Organisation, and to support the opening of new markets through the EU.  Regarding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement the EU Council of Trade Ministers at their meeting in May urged the Commission to advance the negotiations, whilst fully respecting its negotiating mandate and the EU interests.  While many complex and difficult issues remain to be resolved, both the EU and the US negotiators remain optimistic that a comprehensive and ambitious agreement can be concluded.  Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to take up opportunities to trade more easily with the US.

It will end limitations in access to public contracts, open-up services market, and offer predictable conditions for investors.<\/p>  <p>  The main benefits for Ireland in this Agreement include the opening up of public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing.  Ireland also gains unlimited tariff free access for most of our important food exports.  In addition, Ireland successfully campaigned for a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area.  Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  This is of particular benefit to smaller companies for whom paying twice for the same test can be prohibitive.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) EU-US agreement is still being negotiated.  Like the CETA, it is intended that the EU-US Agreement will cover not only tariffs, services and investment but also include regulatory coherence and cooperation.  An EU-US agreement would be the world&rsquo;s largest bilateral trade and investment deal, and a successful conclusion is expected to benefit Ireland more than any other EU Member State.  An independent study commissioned by my Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs could be created.  The findings are backed up in an interim independent report contracted by the EU Commission, carried out by Ecorys Consultancy and published on 13th May 2016.  The report estimates that an EU-US free trade agreement would boost Irish GDP by 1.4 per cent.  <\/p>  <p>  CETA was discussed at the last EU Council of Trade Ministers on 13th May 2016, which I attended.  The Council had an exchange of views on the Agreement and the process towards signature and provisional application.  I made Ireland&rsquo;s approach clear, that based on our current assessment of its provisions, that we viewed CETA as a mixed Agreement, in terms of EU and Member State competency.  This position was also expressed by other Member States.  There are differing views on the legal position on this and the European Commission may be of the view that CETA falls within the competence of the EU only.  We will need to wait and see the formal proposal from the Commission and, importantly, the legal basis for this.  It will be a matter for the European Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature and provisional application of CETA.  It is expected that the decision making process and ratification process of the EU-US FTA will be similar to the EU-Canada Agreement. <\/p>  <p>  It is in Ireland&rsquo;s interest to see strong progress towards the implementation of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement and conclusion of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership as they will provide opportunities for Irish based firms to further diversify their export markets.  The issue of growing market share in other markets is made even more important by the result of the recent UK referendum on its membership of the EU.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UK Referendum on EU Membership","counter":755,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV01450"},{"type":"question","counter":756,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[18990\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the impact the recent decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union will have on policy decisions pertaining to sustaining employment levels, national competitiveness levels and wage growth in the short and medium term; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":757,"content":"<p>On June 24th the UK voted to leave the European Union.  This decision has significant short-term and long term implications for Ireland.  Economically, the uncertainty arising from the outcome of this decision in the short term, has resulted in a weakened exchange rate, stock market volatility and lower growth prospects for the UK economy.  Due to our close and well established ties with the United Kingdom, the outcome of the referendum has particularly direct consequences for Irish growth and trade prospects.<\/p>  <p>  The economic and political implications and timing of Brexit &ndash; and indeed the institutional arrangements between the UK and EU, and between Ireland and the UK are unclear at this juncture. Notwithstanding this considerable uncertainty, the immediate implications for Ireland of the UK leaving the EU are being addressed by Government.  The Government has undertaken careful planning in recent months for the contingency of this result, and we will now take this work forward to ensure that we respond appropriately, and that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are represented fully in the negotiating process.  On June 24th we published a contingency plan outlining our whole of Government response.<\/p>  <p>  While there is a lack of clarity as to how the negotiation process will proceed, I will be working to ensure that there is certainty as early as possible on the terms of future trading relationships. The UK will remain an attractive market for many Irish companies, with a population of over 65 million people. I have met with and will continue to engage intensively with our enterprise development and promotional agencies and other stakeholders and representative bodies.  They will be working with enterprises to support their adjustment to the new arrangements in due course.  Similarly, the UK is the third largest investor in Ireland and I will endeavour to ensure the impact on those relationships is minimised.  I, together with the enterprise agencies under my remit, will also ensure that businesses, investors and potential investors in Ireland are fully informed of Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment to the EU and of developments as they unfold. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is ranked first in the eurozone in the 2016 IMD Global Competitiveness Index and it is important that we continue to sustain that position.  As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I consider it vital to retain a sharp focus on maintaining our own competitiveness for trade and investment.  In particular in relation to areas such as costs, it is important that we continue to provide a stable macroeconomic environment and public finances during the adjustment period.  We need to continue to invest in the areas that will underpin future enterprise growth including in innovation and research, skills and address infrastructure bottlenecks.  We need to sustain our core strengths for inward investment namely a strong pool of highly skilled, multilingual workers in the only English-speaking country within the Eurozone.  We will continue to provide barrier-free access to an EU market of over 450 million consumers. <\/p>  <p>Enterprise 2025, Ireland&rsquo;s National Enterprise Policy, sets out our vision for Ireland to be the best place to succeed in business, delivering sustainable employment and higher standards of living for all.  Enterprise 2025 highlighted the importance of sustaining the progress made on diversifying to non-UK markets and we will continue to support enterprises in that regard.  We will continue to implement Enterprise 2025 through the Annual Action Plan for Jobs.

I understand that the Board of Management conducted a strategic review recently and following this a decision was made that this service would not be in a position to provide services for the under twos.  I understand this was a business decision, and as such is a matter for the Board, which is independent of my Department.<\/p><p>There are a number of changes to Programmes being implemented for the 2016\/17 programme year, including the expansion of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme and changes to the Childcare Regulations concerning qualification requirements for those working in the sector.<\/p><p>The new Childcare Regulations require that all staff working with children in early years services should hold a qualification in early childhood care and education at a minimum of Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) or equivalent.  This is in accordance with international best practice.<\/p><p>In the past, Community Employment participants with no qualifications were used as part of core staff \/ child ratios.  From 31 December, unless these CE participants are in year 3 of their programme and have received their level 5 qualification they cannot be considered as part of core staff ratios but can of course remain as an additional resource to the service.  The level 5 requirement will come into effect on 30 June 2016 for newly-registering services and for existing services on 31 December 2016. <\/p><p>The contract for ECCE<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>has always required that pre-school leaders in ECCE services hold a minimum Level 5 qualification, or equivalent.  From 31 December 2016, all pre-school leaders delivering the ECCE programme must hold a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent.<\/p><p>My Department has long-standing relationships with community\/not-for-profit childcare providers, and recognises the important role that this sector has to play in childcare provision.  As demand for childcare continues to grow with, for example, the ECCE scheme being set to increase from 67,000 children last year to approximately 127,000 in 2017, it is essential to support both community and private childcare provision to meet the higher standards. <\/p><p>In relation to the availability of childcare for children under two, my officials have been in contact with Dublin City Childcare Committee and they are available to assist parents to source alternative childcare provision within the area.  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme provides funding to childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including to children under two, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.  Parents qualify as disadvantaged or low income on the basis of means-tested entitlements. In the case of full day care, parents qualifying for the higher rate of subvention under the CCS Programme can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge for childcare in the participating childcare facility. <font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>Traditionally, CCS was only available through community services, but to ensure wider access for families,<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>in 2016 this Programme has been extended to include private providers for the first time, and my Department is working to ensure the availability of places under this Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016063000078#WRV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"}]
