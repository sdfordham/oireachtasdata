I am sure everybody in the House shares these sentiments.  Our thoughts are with their families at this very sad time.<\/p><p>  It is reported today that the Government will appoint Judge Elizabeth Dunne to chair the new Referendum Commission in respect of the abolition of the Seanad.  This announcement has been made even before the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas - the Legislature - or before we know the date of the referendum.  It seems like the Taoiseach is on a solo run with this initiative.  It is fair to say the Labour Party is less than enthusiastic about it.  The party Whip, Deputy Emmet Stagg, said the only commitment the Labour Party had given was to hold a referendum to scrap the Seanad.  He said &quot;that doesn't tie any Labour person to campaigning for that.&quot;  He then said, &quot;I think the Seanad should be retained.&quot;  Deputy Joanna Tuffy has described it as a power grab, while Deputy Michael McCarthy is determined to campaign for a reformed Seanad and is against its abolition.  Senator John Whelan will vigorously campaign for the reform and retention of the Seanad.  Interestingly, according to Senator John Kelly, the T&aacute;naiste has said the Labour Party can canvass for the retention of the Seanad.  It is fair to say the Labour Party's heart is not in the referendum and that it is a sop to the personal commitment given the Taoiseach at a dinner in 2009.  It is the ultimate power grab.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm whether he has told members of his party that they can canvass for the retention of the Seanad?  If so, is the Government going ahead with the referendum and is it doing so purely because of a personal commitment given by the Taoiseach?  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm when the referendum will be held?  I understand a date in early October has been mooted, but I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will be able to inform the House today about when the Government intends to hold the referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300003#A00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1371115800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I join the Deputy in expressing my sympathy and that of the Government to the families and friends of Paul, Kenny and Shane Bolger, the three brothers from Passage East, County Waterford who lost their lives so tragically in a fishing trip off the south-east coast.  We all share the sense of loss felt by their families, friends, the local community and the entire fishing and maritime community in the country who have always had a great sense of solidarity and grief on occasions such as this.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will recall that referendum commissions have expressed the view on a number of occasions that they would like to have more time to prepare for referendums.  That is the reason the Government has decided at this early stage to appoint Judge Elizabeth Dunne to chair the Referendum Commission.  I am interested to hear the Deputy speak on this subject because he has a bit of form on it.  I recall that he announced publicly that he had voted against the Lisbon treaty in the first referendum on it.  He was then prevailed upon by his Government colleagues to come round on the second occasion; therefore, he knows a bit about the complexities of a referendum campaign.  <\/p><p>  The proposal to abolish the Seanad is a Government proposal in the programme for Government.  The abolition of the Seanad was part of the election manifestos of the two Government parties prior to the last general election and the intention is to proceed with it.  The legislation to give effect to the proposal is before the D&aacute;il and the debate on it will commence shortly.  There will be plenty of opportunities to debate it in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Both Government parties will support the proposal in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and will make the case for it in the event of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad adopting the legislation and proceeding with the referendum.  <\/p><p>  The Labour Party published a document prior to the last general election which set out the rationale for why a small state such as Ireland should have one parliamentary body.  The case being made is that a state with 4.6 million people should have one parliamentary body, which should be the D&aacute;il.  The D&aacute;il should have its powers increased and enhanced to do its job more effectively.  That is why we have been advancing reform measures such as increasing the amount of sittings of the D&aacute;il, providing opportunities for the introduction of Private Members' legislation, the enhancement of the work of the committees, the introduction of legislation to empower the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries, the strengthening of the Freedom of Information legislation and the introduction of whistleblowers legislation.  All of these measures are aimed at reforming our parliamentary process.  I hope that on this occasion Fianna F&aacute;il will support the efforts the Government is making to ensure we will have a modern, efficient and reformed Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300003#A00300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1371116400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>There is no sign of it yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300004#B00100","speaker":"1096"},{"type":"speech","time":1371116400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Is the T&aacute;naiste sure the Labour Party will support it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300004#B00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1371116400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his reply.

The Deputy knows well that it does not take a position one way or the other on what is being put to the people.  Previous referendum commissions have recommended that a commission be appointed at an earlier date.  What the Government is proposing in regard to reform of this House is a new procedure for the processing of legislation.  In the first instance, the heads of a Bill would be discussed by the relevant Oireachtas committee before formal drafting.  This is already in operation and there is a general acceptance that it is a better way of doing our business.  While Report and Final Stages of Bills are taken together, it is proposed that Report Stage be taken in the normal way and that the Bill then be returned to the relevant committee for reflection on issues that may have been missed or may require further re-examination.

My home county of Donegal has seen its fair share of tragedies.  However, the south east has been hit particularly hard in recent years.  Yesterday's tragedy is but one in a long series of tragedies to hit Dunmore East and the Passage East areas of County Waterford.  We all know, too, that fishing is a hazardous occupation and that fishermen put themselves at risk every day they go to work.  While tragedies will always occur, more needs to be done to ensure the safety of fishermen.  I understand that following the recent spate of tragedies, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, undertook to examine the use of personal locator beacons by fishermen as an enhancement of existing safety measures.  These devices are small transmitters worn as a watch or on a life jacket and provide the location of the person rather than the vessel.  They can be of huge assistance in locating within a short period those who have gone overboard.  I understand a series of recommendations on small boat safety have been forwarded by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board to the relevant agencies.  What steps have been taken by the Department in this regard?

The Deputy is correct that a tragedy such as this resonates strongly in coastal and fishing communities.  I know this is a particular issue in County Donegal.  Maritime search and rescue services in the south-east region are provided by a combination of Coast Guard search and boat units, Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, facilities based at Rosslare, Fethard-on-Sea, Kilmore Quay and Dunmore East and community rescue services designated as declared resources to the Irish Coast Guard.  All of these services are supported by the Coast Guard and maritime helicopter services operated out of Waterford and reinforced as required by Coast Guard helicopters in Dublin, Shannon and Sligo.  The upgrade of the helicopter service is ongoing.  Only this week two of the replacement S-92 helicopters arrived in the country.  All maritime emergency responses are co-ordinated by the three rescue co-ordination centres based at Malin, Valentia and Dublin, with the Dublin centre having specific responsibility for the south-east region.  In the unfortunate event of a tragedy occurring, an investigation is conducted by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  I am sure an investigation will take place in this case.<\/p><p>  On the issue of small transmitters and how they can be used to assist in identifying the locations of people and contribute to safety, I understand the matter is under consideration.  I will ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to respond directly to the Deputy on the current status of the recommendations.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to ensure the best available safety and prevention measures are in place to protect those who go to sea, which is hazardous, particularly so in a country with many small fishing ports where the weather can change quickly.

This technology is reasonably cheap and a personal locator beacon can be purchased on the market for approximately &euro;130 exempt of VAT.  Anyone who has an iPhone will know that the Apple corporation has put a personal locator beacon in it because it values its product.  We should give the same type of respect to our fishermen who go to sea and put their lives at risk to make a living for themselves and their families.

All churches and citizens have every right to state their points of view to Government on any issue of public importance.  This is a democratic country and that applies to everybody.  People have the right to state to their legislators their view, whether they are representatives of churches, the pro-life movement or have a private opinion and long may that continue.  It is our job as legislators to legislate in a fair way on behalf of the entire people of the country.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to hear the points of view that are being expressed, to respect them and to respectfully disagree if that is appropriate.  While some of the statements which have been made by church leaders on the legislation are exaggerated, wew should not in the House lose sight of what we are doing.  Of course, I agree that when people make protests and express their points of view, it should be done respectfully.  They should obviously not engage in the harassment of public representatives.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that this legislation is about protecting the lives of women in pregnancy.<\/p><p>  The vast majority of the time, pregnancy and child birth are happy occasions, but there are a small number of cases in which a woman's life is at risk in pregnancy.  It is the Government's settled view that, in those circumstances, we must legislate to provide clarity for women that their lives are safe, that they are safe in our hospitals and to provide clarity for the medical practitioners dealing with them.  In some cases, a termination of pregnancy may be necessary to save the life of a mother.  That is what the legislation is about and we should not get ourselves distracted by the nature of the campaigning, lobbying or engagement with public representatives.  My personal view on the subject has been known for a very long time and over the years I have been subjected to some of the vigorous and sometimes overly vigorous campaigning on it.<\/p><p>We are public representatives and people can state their views passionately.  Sometimes they may go overboard in the way they do it but as long as we are clear in our minds that our job is to legislate on behalf of the people and in the public interest, we will always be able to distinguish between the rights of people to express points of view, including points of view we do not agree with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300005#C01700","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371117600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The bishops have every right to express their views on the proposed legislation but I will take up the T&aacute;naiste on the terminology he used with respect to respectfully disagreeing.

The point I am making concerns when people come to our doors after midnight to intimidate and to threaten and when there is no utterance from the Catholic Church to condemn this intimidation.  Some 75% of the people in Ireland agree with the legislation, no matter how flawed I or others think it is.  This intimidation is still going on and it is not democracy.

Amendment No. 26 inserts a new subsection (4) into section 37 requiring the Governor to prepare a report for the Central Bank Commission on action taken or not taken on foot of protected disclosures received.

Amendment No. 39 is an amendment to section 53 of the Bill dealing with restitution orders.  The restitution provisions contained in the Bill will allow the Central Bank to apply to the High Court for a restitution order against any person who has been unjustly enriched or caused another person to suffer loss or detriment as a result of committing a contravention of the financial services legislation.<\/p><p>  Upon such an application being made, the High Court may order the person concerned to pay to the Central Bank such sums as the High Court deems appropriate, having regard to the extent to which the person has been unjustly enriched or another person has suffered loss or detriment.  The Central Bank may then make a distribution of this money to any person who has suffered loss or detriment in accordance with the directions of the High Court.<\/p><p>  The provisions currently allow for restitution only with respect to persons found to have committed a contravention through the Central Bank's administrative sanction regime, as outlined in Part III(C) of the Central Bank Act 1942.  Separate regimes also exist for the purposes of various securities laws and regulations necessarily separate due to the subject matter of those regulations.<\/p><p>  There is every reason why someone guilty of a contravention of the prospectus, market abuse or transparency directives should also be liable to a restitution action on the same basis as those guilty of a contravention under other provisions of Irish financial services law generally.  For that reason, the scope of the mechanism proposed is being widened to bring such regimes within the restitution regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300009#G02400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371119400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371119400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 37:<blockquote>  In page 45, line 33, to delete &#8220;, himself or herself&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300009#G02700","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371119400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371119400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 38:<blockquote>  In page 45, lines 37 and 38, to delete &#8220;, himself or herself&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300009#G02900","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371119400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371119400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 39:<blockquote>  In page 45, line 46, to delete &#8220;1942, or&#8221; and substitute the following:&#8220;1942,<br \/><br \/>(b) on whom any sanction has been imposed under:<br \/><br \/>(i) Regulation 99 of the Prospectus (Directive 2003\/71\/EC) Regulations 2005 (S.I.

It is modelled on similar provisions in the Companies Acts.<\/p><p>  It provides that, in a trial on indictment of an offence under financial services legislation, the court may order that copies of a range of documents may be provided to members of the jury.  The documents include any documents admitted in evidence, transcripts of the opening speeches of counsel, testimony given by witnesses and the judge's charge to the jury, as well as any charts, diagrams, graphics and summaries of evidence produced at the trial.<\/p><p>  In particular, they may include an affidavit of an accountant summarising any transactions by the accused relevant to the alleged offence.  The purpose in providing that copies of such documents may be given to members of the jury is to facilitate its assimilation and deliberation of issues before the courts which in many cases can be complex and complicated.<\/p><p>  Provision is also contained in the section to ensure that where the prosecution proposes to apply to have a copy of the document given to the jury, it will first have to provide a copy to the accused who may make representations to the courts as to whether the document in question should in fact be provided to the jury.  In addition, the court may order in the case of an affidavit of an accountant that the person making the affidavit attends and explains to the jury any relevant accounting procedures or principles.<\/p><p>  The need for such provisions in other regulated sectors has been acknowledged and legislated for.  To date, no like provisions have been introduced in the financial services sector.  The objective of the amendment, which was discussed on Committee Stage, is to give the jury, which has to come to a decision in complicated, difficult and complex cases, all of the information it needs to come to the decision that is required, and to do so in a user friendly way which helps it in its deliberations.  I understand this mirrors statutes in other aspects of Irish commercial law where this has been required to help juries to get a full understanding of the cases that come before them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300009#G03800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371119400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371119400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 43 to 71, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300009#G04000","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1371119400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 43:<blockquote>In page 48, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:&#8220; 'debt collector' means a person who for remuneration collects or seeks to collect consumer credit debt;&#8221;.<\/blockquote>This deals with debt collectors, as does amendment No. 70.  Debt collectors are currently unregulated and need to be brought into the fold.  Recently the Society of St. Vincent de Paul warned of a potential money lending crisis as more and more people turn to them to make ends meet.  Some research suggests that half of households go into debt to pay regular bills.<\/p><p>  As the Minister of State knows, I introduced proposed legislation to cap the extortionate rates of interest moneylenders charge.  We know some APRs are up to 187%.  Many people will end up in the hands of debt collectors, as distinct from moneylenders, who remain unregulated.<\/p><p> The Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears looks set to remove the limit on the frequency with which borrowers in arrears may be contacted by lenders.  The Free Legal Advice Centres pointed out in their submission on the review of the code that the Central Bank should immediately prioritise the regulation of debt collection on a statutory basis, with a proper licensing system and a code of conduct applying to such entities.  A suitable vehicle for this might be the Bill before us today, which was referred to the select committee on 26 October 2011.  It is curious that a Bill ostensibly designed to improve the regulation of financial service providers by the Central Bank should have been allowed to stall in this manner.  The core sentiment of the Free Legal Advice Centres is that the activities of debt collectors must be regulated and this is the appropriate legislation in which to provide for same.<\/p><p> My amendment No. 43 proposes the inclusion in section 57(<i>b<\/i>), which provides several definitions of terms referred to in the legislation, of a definition of &quot;debt collector&quot;.  I welcome the inclusion of debt management firms within the regulatory remit of the Central Bank, but there is no reason debt collectors cannot be regulated in the same way.  The inclusion of the definition in this section will empower the Central Bank in that regard.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 70 deals with the fees charged by debt management agencies.  Section 62 of the Bill gives the Central Bank the power to impose on a person who is authorised to carry out the work of a debt management firm &quot;such conditions or requirements or both as the Bank considers appropriate relating to the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of debt management firms&quot;.  That is very much welcome.  Also welcome is the provision that the Central Bank may direct that person &quot;not to carry on the business of a debt management firm for such period (not exceeding 3 months) as is specified in the direction&quot;.  My amendment seeks, in addition, to empower the Central Bank to direct a direct management agency to publish the fees and charges it proposes to apply to its customers.<\/p><p> I referred to moneylenders in the context of an earlier amendment.  The Central Bank requires all moneylenders to publish their fees and charges, which are made available on the bank's website.  This intent of this amendment is to empower consumers by ensuring they have as much information as possible.  It does not seek to create any obligation, rather it simply provides another way in which the Central Bank may choose to direct a debt management agency.  I have dealt with cases in which people have moved from tracker to variable-rate mortgages, for instance, because they did not read the documentation they were given or did not understand the conditions set out therein.  This is about empowering consumers by requiring debt management agencies to publish their fees and charges in a transparent way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300009#G04100","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371120000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 43 and 57 as proposed by Deputy Doherty.  The Minister for Finance has pointed out that he has no responsibility for the regulation of debt collectors and debt collecting firms.  Debt collection services apply across a significantly broader range of activities than simply the recovery of moneys for financial products.  They also apply in the case of utilities, rents and other consumer debts, as well as debts between businesses.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible for legislation in this area.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 applies to all debt collectors operating across all sectors of the economy, including private individuals and debt collecting firms.  Under section 11 of that Act, it is an offence to demand payment of a debt in a way designed to cause harm, distress or humiliation.  A person found guilty of offences under the Act is subject to large fines and up to 14 years' imprisonment.  In the case of financial institutions that use debt collecting firms, the Central Bank has imposed requirements that offer protection to consumers under its revised consumer protection code.  The code obliges the covered regulated entities to ensure that any outsourced activity such as debt collection complies with the requirement of the code.<\/p><p>  In fairness to Deputy Doherty, he has been consistent on this issue in recent years.  I understand he introduced a Private Members' Bill in this regard and also raised it during other Private Members' debates.  We have had two initiatives in this specific area, as I discovered in the course of my preparations for this debate.  There is no doubt that this is an area that requires closer regulation.  However, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, pointed out on Committee Stage, it is under the auspices of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The latter has indicated a willingness to examine the issue in a constructive way and to work with colleagues across the House to establish an improved regulatory and statutory framework for this area.  I very much hope that whatever comes out of that initiative or series of initiatives will address the issues Deputy Doherty has identified.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 44 and 58 deal with an issue in respect of the definition of  &quot;excepted person&quot; which was raised on Committee Stage, namely, that the Money Advice and Budgeting Service was not included in the list of exempted categories.  That organisation is a charity, does not charge for services and receives Government funding.  Meeting any one of these three criteria would provide an exemption under the legislation.  In the interests of certainty and greater clarity, however, it is considered appropriate to name MABS specifically as being exempt from the definition of a debt management service and to provide that organisation with an exemption from the requirements provided for in respect of a money transmission service.<\/p><p>  Amendments Nos. 45 to 56, inclusive, and 59 to 69, inclusive, are technical amendments.<\/p><p>  I do not propose to accept Deputy Doherty's amendment No. 70.  The provision that was agreed in this regard on Committee Stage is broad enough to cover the requirement.  In addition, the Central Bank's revised consumer protection code will require the publishing of fees and services by the entities covered by the provisions in this Bill.  Section 62 provides that the bank may impose on a debt management agency &quot;such conditions or requirements or both as the Bank considers appropriate relating to the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of debt management firms&quot;.  I very much take on board what Deputy Doherty is seeking to do in terms of ensuring fees are transparent, but it is our view that the existing broad definition as set out under section 62 allows that to happen in circumstances in which the Cental Bank deems it necessary.  Therefore, I do not accept the necessity of including the provision in amendment No. 70.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 71 is a technical amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300010#H00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1371120000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I take the Minister of State's point in regard to my amendment No. 70 that the reference in section 62 to \"such conditions or requirements or both as the Bank considers appropriate\" would seem to allow the Central Bank to require these entities to publish their fees and charges.  If he can tell me that this will actually happen, that is fair enough and there is no need to press the amendment.  In other words, if it is the intention of Government that the fees and charges of debt management agencies will be published in the same way that moneylenders' fees and charges are published, then there is no need for this additional transparency provision.  My concern, however, is that this potentially will not happen even though, as the Minister of State outlined, the scope for it to happen is contained within the existing provision.<\/p><p>That is why I wanted to specify it in the Bill as a subsection.  If the Minister of State can confirm to me that it is intended that the fees and charges of debt management agencies will be published in the manner I have suggested, that would be welcome.<\/p><p> In respect of amendment No. 43 concerning the regulation of debt collectors, I agree with the Minister of State up to a point.  There is no doubt that the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Department of Justice and Equality have a role to play in regulating debt collectors.  The problem is that this has fallen between two stools, between the Departments of Finance and Justice and Equality because of the different types of debt collector involved, while the Minister of State has mentioned different types of product and service and so on.  It is welcome that the Minister for Finance has indicated that the Minister for Justice and Equality is willing to consider this and work with others.  There is no doubt that my party and I will work closely with the Minister if he is bringing forward this legislation.<\/p><p> I want, however, to discuss the core of this amendment.  The amendment does not deal with debt collectors across the board, although the Minister of State spoke about business debts and so on.  It does not attempt to regulate debt collectors in that fashion; it defines a debt collector as &quot;a person who for remuneration collects or seeks to collect consumer credit debt&quot; and, therefore, applies to consumer credit debt only.  The Central Bank should regulate any agency that collects consumer credit debt.  This involves accepting that there is a role for the Department of Justice and Equality in dealing with debt collectors, but the amendment attempts to include consumer credit debt within the terms of a financial service provider in order that a portion of it can be regulated by the Central Bank.  That is one of the major core problems and the reason we have not so far moved to regulate debt collectors because some of their work falls within the brief of the Minister for Finance and some within the brief of the Minister for Justice and Equality because of the different types of service and product involved.  This is simply about consumer credit debt and it would be very hard to say the Central Bank should not regulate consumer credit debt and its collection.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister of State has decided not to accept the amendment, but I have spoken on it again because I passionately believe we need to regulate for it.  This is one of the few areas left unregulated and we must move quickly towards regulating it.  While the Minister for Justice and Equality is committed to dealing with something in the future, we could in this Bill which could pass into law within a few days regulate consumer credit debt.

One could ask whether that should be part of it.  In any aspect of codifying the law it is better to take a more streamlined approach rather than doing it piecemeal.  We know from our discussions on the Finance Acts that there is an argument for codifying the law, consolidating it and making clear what it means.  Were we to accept the amendment, the approach would be piecemeal, albeit - I accept the Deputy's point - specific to one area.<\/p><p>  I mean it sincerely that the Minister for Justice and Equality is examining this issue closely and has indicated that he would like to move in this area.  The Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance will work closely with him, but he is the lead Minister in this area and has shown a very strong zeal for introducing legislation and reform that he believes is necessary.  There is no doubt that the public and private sectors argue for the need to codify the law in this area.  The question is whether we do it in a piecemeal or a consolidated way.  It is the considered view of the Government that a consolidated approach through the Department of Justice and Equality is the way to go.  That does not take from the fact that the Department of Finance which obviously has a huge interest in this area because of the points the Deputy has made will look very closely at and work with him on this matter.  I assure the Deputy that that will happen.<\/p><p>  On the Deputy's other amendment concerning the fees charged, to be as blunt as possible, I cannot see any reason the fees charged would not be published.  That is why that is provided for, as I said, in section 62.  Irrespective of that section, there is also within the consumer protection code a requirement for the publication of fees.  The Central Bank is not an agency of the State, but it is an autonomous organisation, as set out in statute over many years, and its remit is slightly different.  I cannot see a circumstance in which the fees charged would not be published; it is in the interests of consumers, financial companies and those dealing with this area that they would be published.  We believe that what the Deputy is attempting, rightly in the context of his amendment, is provided for and we do not see a difficulty in ensuring the fees charged are published in the manner set out in the consumer protection code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300011#J00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1371120600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>In respect of amendment No. 70, based on what the Minister of State has said, I am aware that when an agency or the courts interpret legislation or the law, they will also consider the intention-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300011#J00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1371120600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>They will also look at the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300011#J00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1371120600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Therefore, the Minister of State's statement is very welcome.

The legislation proposes that if the Financial Services Ombudsman thinks that it would be in the public interest to do so, a report may be made if a regulated financial service provider has, in the preceding financial year, at least three complaints made against it to the Financial Services Ombudsman which have been found to be substantiated or partly substantiated.  There will be varying complaints from how people have been treated by a financial service provider to more serious cases of bad practice.  The problem is that the financial ombudsman will be constrained from making a report unless a minimum of three complaints has been made in the preceding 12 months.  Amendment No. 72 removes this three-complaint clause and, instead, provides that the ombudsman can issue a report if it is in the public interest and one complaint has been made.  This will provide flexibility.  I accept there may not necessarily be a need for a report on every complaint made.  However, the legislation insists it must be in the public interest for a report to be issued.  This amendment allows for the financial ombudsman to issue a report in the public interest even if only one or two complaints have been made in the preceding 12 months.  It is a minor amendment but leaves power with the ombudsman.<\/p><p>  The legislation also proposes a report from the financial ombudsman will contain the name of the regulated financial service provider, including any trading name, the identity of any group of which the regulated financial service provider is a member and the number of complaints found to be substantiated, or partly substantiated, in respect of the regulated financial service provider in the preceding financial year.  For example, if complaints were made against a subsidiary of AIB - I am not making any accusations against any institution - that it was trying to move customers off tracker to variable rate mortgages in an underhand way, the financial ombudsman could issue a report on the company and state that AIB is the parent group.  Amendment No. 73 proposes to ensure such a report would a brief summary of the nature and content of each complaint found to be substantiated, or partly substantiated, in respect of the regulated financial service provider in the preceding financial year.  This could cover interest rates, overcharging and switching mortgages.  We know the majority of complaints being currently substantiated by the financial ombudsman concern those taken off tracker mortgages to variable rate ones.  The ombudsman does not have the power to name the institutions involved.  My concern is that the ombudsman could have a file with up to 100 complaints about an institution but can only name the institution and the number of complaints without explaining the nature of the complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300012#K03300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1371121800,"counter":259,"content":"<p>On amendments Nos. 72 to 77, on Committee Stage we discussed the <i>de minimis<\/i> rule in regard to the naming of providers who had substantiated or partly substantiated complaints against them.  The legislation provides for the naming of providers where there is in excess of three complaints against them.  This provision is adequate.  The argument made, to which the Minister responded, was on the proportionality question, namely, that in order for a systemic problem to emerge which requires further investigation, it is not unreasonable to say three or more complaints would have to be made to highlight the problem.  If three or more complaints were made on a specific issue related to a specific product or behaviour, one would think there was a systemic problem.  The argument the Minister made on Committee Stage was related to the sense of smell about a matter, namely, that if there was a bad smell about one provider in a small town, it could have a hugely detrimental effect on the totality of the business.  That is why the three complaints rule has been included in the section to make it proportionate to the scale of the problem that may emerge because if there is a problem in one area, there will be a problem in another in terms of the individual, the business or the product sold.  The three complaints rule in an important proportionate response to a problem that may come to the attention of the Ombudsman from time to time.  Therefore, we are not proposing to take on board amendment No. 72 as it would disproportionately and negatively deal with financial services providers.<\/p><p>  I will also not be taking on board amendment No. 73 as I have proposed a similar amendment in this regard.  There was a discussion during the debate on Committee Stage about whether the category and description of substantiated or partly substantiated complaint against a financial services provider should be published.  In response we agreed to examine these points before Report Stage.  Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, I can confirm that under section 70, section 57BF(2)(<i>ca<\/i>)(i) of the principal Act already deals with the issue of category.  That is the clear view of the Attorney General.  The point the Deputy is raising in terms of the description and categories involved has been dealt with as they are set out under section 70 in terms of identification in the report and the different classes involves.

However, they do not state clearly that there will be identification of the nature of the complaint.  They deal with the sub-categorisation of the regulated financial service provider.  To obtain clarity, I will give an example.  If a financial institution had a dozen claims made against it that were substantiated by the Ombudsman and, say, the claims were that it wrongly moved its customers from tracker mortgages to variable rate mortgages, using the powers of the Central Bank, the powers provided under this legislation or existing powers, would the report include not only the name of the institution, the parent company and the number of claims made but inform other consumers of the nature of the complaints made, that the ombudsman had upheld 12 complaints made against the institution that it was wrongly moving tracker mortgage consumers to variable rate mortgages?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300013#L00400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1371121800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300013#L00500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1371121800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>If that is clear, there is no issue in that respect.<\/p><p>  I have another point on the other amendment.  As I will probably not get in to speak on it again, I will make that point now.  It relates to the three complaints rule.  I agree with the Minister's position in terms of proportionality and point that if there is a bad smell about something in an area, one would not want to alarm everybody in the village.  All of this is left in the trust of the Financial Regulator.  Sometimes there may be a bad smell about something in a village that the rest of those living in the village should not be informed about it, but sometimes the smell is very damaging to the individual because on examining its nature the individual realises that the problem could be systemic.  Even though the individual might have identified only one matter that had a bad smell about it, the ombudsman would have to intervene, investigate the matter and examine how it had happened and if in his or her view it was a matter about which the rest of the village should be alerted.  That is the whole point of this.  Under this section, the Ombudsman is being curtailed in identifying a major issue because two blocks are being put in his or her way.  The first block is that three complaints of the same nature must be made and the second is that they must be made within a 12 month calendar period.  <\/p><p>  There are potential circumstances - I hope they will never arise - where the identification and upholding of a complaint, or two, by the Ombudsman are of a nature and size to cause significant alarm and the ombudsman will have to judge whether it is in the public interest that the matter be brought to the attention of the wider public.  In this respect, I again cite the example of tracker and variable rate mortgages.  I cited a case to the Minister for Finance on Committee Stage of talking to a person late at night about their difficulty in holding on to the family home where the bank had issued a letter demanding that they surrender it.  I looked at the documentation and told the person that they were supposed to have a tracker mortgage, but they were on a variable rate mortgage.  If people knew that was happening in that institution, which I will not name, they would take their documents out of the drawer and examine the paperwork.  If the subject of the complaint is of a scale that the financial services ombudsman believes it is in public interest to bring it to the attention of the wider public, I genuinely believe we should not curtail his or her view that it is in the public interest, otherwise it is wrong.  If a complaint has been upheld after the ombudsman has examined it and if the view has been formed in his or her office that it is in the public interest to inform other consumers about the complaint - this issue is about the protection of consumers at the end of the day - why put two blocks in the way of the ombudsman?  In terms of the amendment, I intend to remove one of these blocks, the three complaints rule.  In effect, it means that if a complaint is made to the ombudsman and that there was only complaint about one institution in the previous financial year, the ombudsman probably will not issue a report because he or she has to make a judgment that it is in the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300013#L00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1371121800,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 77 provides for the insertion of the words \"and the different descriptions of those complaints\" in section 70.  To take the tracker mortgage example and the dubious activities of a bank or a collection of banks that might attempt to move people from a tracker mortgage, there is nothing in any shape or form which does not allow a full description of those complaints.<\/p><p>It is our considered view that there has been a response to Committee Stage proceedings and the need to free up the opportunity of the Financial Services Ombudsman to describe such complaints in his report, and there is no difficulty around that.  I believe Deputy Doherty's concern, which is genuine, is being met by our amendment No. 77.  It is perfectly straightforward.<\/p><p> Deputy Doherty referred to the different description of those complaints in the subsequent amendment.  <i>Ipso facto<\/i>there could be a thousand and one different descriptions but the amendment deals with a literal description of a complaint, whether relating to a tracker mortgage or anything else, and I believe that deals with the issue.<\/p><p> There is consensus on the issue of the <i>de minimus<\/i>rule.  The point has been made about tracker mortgages and although it is an issue for banks it is not necessarily an issue for the small trader in a small town.  In any course of events, more than three complaints could be made against a bank where this particular activity is attempted by it.  The key issue is to be proportionate.  The Minister for Finance had a good discussion with colleagues on this issue on Committee Stage.  It is important to be proportionate and small brokers, who must deal with all the issues that come with the territory, are not the same as large plcs or banks.  With the <i>de minimus<\/i>rule we are trying to introduce some proportionality in the scale of complaints that are made.  A defined architecture is being put in place as a result of this Bill and there have been other changes on the regulatory side in recent years.  If difficulties emerge they will come to public attention via the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Central Bank.  There is no attempt in this legislation to in any way delimit or reduce the opportunity for a full investigation or a full public airing of these issues.  For these reasons I do not propose to accept Deputy Doherty's amendment.  However, in respect of the other point about the importance of describing these complaints in a manner that is clear and transparent, I assure Deputy Doherty that amendment No. 77 deals with the issue.  There should be no doubt about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300013#L00700","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371122400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 77 is one I had overlooked.

The resolution Act provides the permanent resolution regime in this State that allows the Central Bank to deal in an effective manner with credit institutions that are failing or are likely to fail into the future.

The amendments to the resolution Act would provide that in the context of a transfer of the assets and liabilities of a credit institution in resolution, where the Minister has indicated his consent to a financial incentive that is in the form of a payment, the payment will be made on his direction by the Central Bank from the resolution fund established under the Act, rather than the Minister making a payment from the Central Fund, as currently envisaged in section 46 of the Act, which is subsequently recouped from the resolution fund.  This will provide a more straightforward and streamlined procedure.<\/p><p>  The amendments will also provide more comprehensively in regard to the payment of interest on moneys in the resolution fund and in regard to the preparation and audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of the resolution fund's accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300016#O02500","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371123000,"counter":294,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371123000,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 85 to 89, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300016#O02700","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1371123000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 85:<blockquote>In page 64, line 24, to delete &#8220;1973&#8221; and substitute &#8220;1973<sup>1<\/sup>&#8221;.<br \/><br \/><sup>1<\/sup>OJ No. L228, 16.8.1973, p.3<\/blockquote>Amendments Nos. 85 to 88, inclusive, are all drafting amendments to Part 13 of the Bill.

The amendment is simply to remove any doubt about that position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300016#O02800","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371123000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371123000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 86:<blockquote>In page 64, line 29, to delete &#8220;class&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300016#O03000","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371123000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371123000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 87:<blockquote>In page 65, lines 27 and 28, to delete &#8220;after the commencement of this Act&#8221; and substitute the following:&#8220;after the coming into operation of <i>section 82<\/i> of the <i>Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013<\/i>&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300016#O03200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371123000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371123000,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 88:<blockquote>In page 65, line 43, to delete &#8220;force&#8221; and substitute &#8220;operation&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300016#O03400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371123000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371123000,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 89:<blockquote>In page 67, after line 32, to insert the following:&#8220;Amendment of section 38 of Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010.<br \/><br \/>89.--Section 38 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 is amended by inserting the following subsection after subsection (3):<blockquote>&#8220;(3A) Where the Minister provides a financial incentive under subsection (1) which is in the form of a payment or gives rise to a payment, the payment shall be made from the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof.&#8221;.&#8221;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300016#O03600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1371123000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1371123000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 90 to 92, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300016#O03800","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1371123000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 90:<blockquote>In page 70, line 25, to delete &#8220;or&#8221;.<\/blockquote>Amendments Nos. 90 and 91 are drafting amendments to Schedule 2 of the Bill.

This has caused genuine concern among people in Cork, particularly those employed at the Whiddy and Whitegate terminals.  At a national level these two facilities are of strategic importance to our oil and gas security.  We have previously discussed the future of refining in this country.  While both facilitates are separate in terms of operation, they are equally important. <\/p><p>  The Whiddy Island terminal was set up by Gulf Oil and commenced oil storage operations in the 1960s.  It has had a chequered history since, most notably the <i>Betelgeuse<\/i> disaster in 1979 which resulted in the loss of 50 lives.  I understand the jetty has still not been repaired.  The State has had an interest in the Whiddy oil terminal since.  The development of a single point mooring has resulted in increased activity in recent years.  International experiences such as the turmoil in north Africa, in particular Libya, have led to increased use of the Whiddy oil terminal for transshipping fuel and the storage of crude and other oil products which, in turn, has led to the creation of hundreds of jobs.  The proposed sale of the terminal by Phillips 66 has, therefore, caused some concern.<\/p><p>  The Whitegate Oil Refinery, while not in my constituency but of equal strategic importance to the country, is also up for sale.  The people directly employed at these facilities need reassurance from the Minister in regard to the Government's future policy for the oil storage facility, the national oil reserves on Whiddy Island and at other locations around the country and, critically, any imminent decision on the future of refining in this country.  <\/p><p>  As regards increased activity in oil and gas exploration off the south and west coasts, the Minister might elaborate on whether there could be a tie-in between storage, refining and the exploration industry.  It is critically important for the future energy security of the State that he make a statement on the future of these facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300018#Q00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1371124200,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I can never get accustomed to speaking to a House in which there are no Opposition Members present.

Security of oil supply is central to the economy and our economic and social development.  Oil is imported either in the form of petroleum products or as crude oil.  The crude oil imported into Ireland is refined in Cork.  The refinery supplies about one quarter of the petroleum product on the domestic market.  Some 75% of Irish oil supplies are imported in product form from neighbouring markets.  Oil comprised 59% of total final energy consumption in Ireland in 2011.  While significant efforts are under way to improve energy efficiency and increase renewable energy levels, it is clear, particularly in the heating and transport sectors, that oil will continue to play a pivotal role in the economy in the medium term.  For this reason, ensuring a robust oil infrastructure on the island is an essential part of our security of supply strategy.<\/p><p>  Ireland is a committed member of the International Energy Agency, IEA, and was one of its founding members.  As part of our IEA and EU obligations, we hold 90 days worth of strategic oil stocks for use in a supply disruption.  The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, holds 88 of Ireland's 90 days of strategic reserves of oil.  The remaining two days worth are held by large oil consuming companies.  In recent years NORA has been increasing the proportion of stocks held on the island of Ireland in line with Government policy to improve accessibility and the availability of oil stocks during an oil supply disruption.<\/p><p>At the end of December 2008, NORA held 46% of its stockholding obligation as physical stocks on the island of Ireland, 38% as physical stocks abroad and 16% as stock tickets.  By the end of April 2013, NORA had made significant progress and now holds 71% of strategic oil stocks as physical stocks on the island of Ireland and 29% as physical stocks abroad.<\/p><p> To underpin this development, NORA has opened three new oil storage facilities, in Antrim, Dublin and Kerry, which have considerably enhanced oil security on the island of Ireland.  NORA will continue to seek out new storage facilities on the island, subject to value for money considerations.  Reducing energy consumption through energy efficiency measures is the first pillar of energy policy.  We are also working hard to ensure that we meet our 2020 renewable energy target of 16% of all energy consumed across the economy coming from renewable sources.  Discussions on the oil-refining sector in Europe have been ongoing at EU and IEA level in the last two years in view of how the sector has been developing internationally.  My Department has been following these discussions closely.<\/p><p> Phillips 66, the current owner of Ireland's oil refinery in Cork, recently confirmed that it had commenced a process to market the refinery, storage terminal and associated business.  The company has confirmed that it intends to continue operating the assets as usual during the marketing process, which is expected to last for several months.  The refinery was in State ownership for some years and was operated by Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC, which sold the refinery together with the Bantry terminal in 2001 to a private company known as Tosco.  Tosco subsequently sold on the refinery.  The day-to-day operation of the refinery and terminal is a matter for the current owners, Phillips 66.  Under the terms of the sale from INPC to Tosco, the refinery and terminal must continue to be operated until 2016.  This obligation applies also to Phillips 66 and any subsequent owners.<\/p><p> My Department recently commissioned a review of the strategic case for oil refining requirements on the island of Ireland.  The report has been finalised and was recently considered by the Government.  I plan to publish the report shortly.  My Department is also continuing to engage with Phillips 66 regarding its future plans for the Irish business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300018#Q00600","speaker":"947","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371124500,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply, in which his concern about this development showed through.

It is open to the committee to bring in representatives from Phillips 66 to discuss different aspects of that company's decision.  The fact is that the obligations to 2016 will remain in place.  It is difficult to say what will happen in the months ahead, however.  It has been the thrust of policy of the National Oil Reserves Agency to ensure that more and more of the stocks needed to meet our 90-day obligation are located in Ireland.  Bantry, in the Deputy's own constituency, is hugely significant in that regard.  I assure Deputies Harrington and Stanton and other colleagues from the region that we were dealing with the future of Whitegate before any announcement was made by its current owner on its long-term plans.  Studies, both completed and under way, have been undertaken in Europe on the scale of refining capacity in the EU at the moment and on how essential or otherwise it is that each country maintain the same scale of refining capacity as existed in days gone by.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked me what connection, if any, existed between the prospects for oil finds in the broad vicinity of the facilities and the maintenance of Whitegate.  I have visited the area and am aware of direct discussions between, for example, Barryroe and Whitegate management.  It is too early to say what the story is, but certainly there is oil in the Barryroe strike.  What has not yet been established is whether it is commercially viable and extractable.  It may require the drilling of another two or three wells to establish that.  It is encouraging, however.  Clearly, the lead shareholder in the company sees a direct link between the prospect and the availability of the facility at Whitegate.  In addition, the Deputy will know that we have recently started to drill off D&uacute;n Chaoin, which is a particularly hopeful prospect.  One cannot say with any certainty, but it appears to be a significant development.  All of this will be taken into account.  Perhaps the time to resume the discussion will be when the Deputies have accessed the strategic study and have an opportunity to tease it through in committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300019#R00300","speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Charges Review","time":1371124500,"counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300019#R00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1371124500,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for selecting this topic and welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, to the House.  Earlier, there was an indication that the issue might be taken by a representative of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Someone was trying to disown it, which I found surprising, as there has been a Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill on the Seanad Order Paper since last August.  There has been little movement on it, which is very disappointing.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State will be aware, having met local authority members during the week, of the sense of frustration among commercial ratepayers, particularly retailers nationally, about the system of valuation and collection of rates.  It is really causing major difficulties.  This is the last Victorian form of taxation we have left.  During the week, there was a Private Members' Bill before the House seeking the repeal of the local property tax.  I support the concept of a local property tax, which is a form of local government revenue generation which is voluntary from the point of view of the valuation of residential houses.<\/p><p>We could learn an awful lot and apply it to the valuation of commercial property.  Currently, the only thing the Valuation Office takes into consideration is the building's location, size and letting value.  It does not take into account whether it is high up or low down, the commercial reality as it pertains to an individual, or the difficulties a person had in keeping the door open.  One of the first hello letters people get when they establish businesses is a demand for rates from the local authority.  Also, bad debts are accumulated and carried forward, particularly in the case of commercial premises for sale in commercially attractive areas.  One of the primary reasons they cannot be sold is the debt, due to commercial rates from the local authority, associated with premises hanging in the background.  In this country we are trying to deal with debt from the point of view of the State and the individual but we avoid addressing debt from the point of view of commercial property and the business community.<\/p><p> Members routinely say the only way we will stimulate growth in the economy to a real and sustainable level is to increase confidence.  The retail sector has had its confidence sapped and is in dire need of having the calculation procedures for the collection of commercial rates reformed.  Some two and a half years into this Government's term, even though the issue is a cornerstone of the programme for Government in terms of funding local authorities and empowering local authority representatives to get on with their jobs, the legislation is still hanging around and is no closer to the D&aacute;il than it was a year ago.  For that reason, I am disappointed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300019#R00500","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371125100,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Donovan for raising this important matter.  The Government published the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 on 3 August 2012 as part of its legislative programme.  The main purpose of the Bill is to accelerate the revaluation programme, which is required to take account of the differential movements in property values that have occurred over a prolonged period of time in order to maintain uniformity in the valuation base.  Such uniformity is essential in order to achieve the policy objective of ratepayers paying commercial rates on an equitable basis.  This, in turn, supports a more competitive business environment and an improved compliance environment.  Such a comprehensive revaluation of property has not been undertaken since the middle of the 19th century.<\/p><p>  The Bill proposes a number of specific measures in this regard.  It provides a statutory basis to enable the Valuation Office to put pilot schemes in place for outsourcing some of the revaluation work and exploring the possibility of introducing an element of self-assessment by ratepayers to the valuation process.  There are additional provisions in the Bill that seek to streamline the current valuation process.  Each of these will help to speed up the revaluation process.  The Bill proceeded through Second Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in October.  Officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and from the Valuation Office have engaged with a wide range of stakeholders and other interested parties on the Bill and potential amendments that may be introduced on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>  The programme of revaluing all commercial and industrial properties in the State for rateable valuation purposes is the responsibility of the Valuation Office, which is headed by the Commissioner of Valuation, who is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions, which are principally derived from the Valuation Act 2001.  The national revaluation programme was provided for in the 2001 Act and the expectation was that the complete revaluation of all commercial property in the State would take ten years to complete.  That has not happened and the assumption has proven to be overly optimistic.<\/p><p>  To date, the revaluation programme has been completed in the South Dublin County Council area in 2007, in Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councils in 2009 and 2010 respectively.  The revaluation of Dublin City Council, the largest in the country, began in May 2011 and will be completed with the publication of a new valuation list in December 2013, which will become effective for rating purposes from January 2014.  The Valuation Office is continuing to extend the revaluation programme across the country.  The commissioner signed valuation orders for the three Waterford rating authority areas on 12 December 2011 and for Limerick County Council and Limerick City Council on 29 March 2012.  The Waterford and Limerick revaluations will be completed in 2013 and 2014 respectively.  At that stage, approximately 33% of all rateable properties in the country, representing over 50% of the national valuation base in monetary terms, will have been revalued.  The Commissioner has also indicated his intention, subject to a statutory consultation process that is now under way, to sign valuation orders for Galway City Council, Carlow and Kilkenny rating authority areas during 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300020#S00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1371125100,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I accept what the Minister of State said in terms of the painstaking nature of the acceleration of the programme.  He referred to the equitable basis but the current system is inequitable and I do not see it changing any time soon without greater voluntary and individual input.  This should be along the same lines as the local property tax regime, whereby a relationship of trust is built up between the local authority and the individual and that we trust them on the basis of the commercial reality as it pertains to the business, what they can pay and what they should pay.  Two different businesses may exist side-by-side on a street.  In any town, there is dereliction and vacant properties, which is in part due to the valuation process, the length of time it takes and the archaic Victorian system of compiling rates.  We need to examine the length of time valuation is taking and the concept of whether the valuation system is fit for purpose.  It was designed under the Griffith system in the middle of the 19th century and has not changed since.<\/p><p>  The State has introduced a form of taxation this year, the local property tax, which is based entirely on trust.  We need to examine that model with commercial people and businesses.  If 30% of properties are valued after four years, it will take another four years before the remainder is valued.  In the meantime, retail space all over the country is crippled.  The Bill does not take reality into consideration.  For many local authorities, the compliance rate in 2009 was 84% and dropped to 76% in 2011.  It does not take into consideration people's inability to pay.  This must be examined so that we can say we are delivering, like a local property tax, a form of funding for local authorities.  I do not see that happening in the current Bill.  When the Bill finds its way to the D&aacute;il, I ask that the Government be open to taking suggestions from ISME, the Small Firms Association, individual retailers and Deputies who have been inundated with people telling them about commercial reality and commercial rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300020#S00300","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1371125100,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the Government is open to looking at any system that will obtain the same amount of money.  For the ratepayer, the net issue is the cost and for the local authority the net issue is how much money is obtained.  We will examine any system that generates the same amount of income, if not more.  I refer to the two amendments to the existing Bill tabled in the Seanad.<\/p><p>One provides for more self assessment as a pilot model.  That goes towards what the Deputy is seeking.  The second is outsourcing some of this work so we can get on with the task.  The Deputy is correct.  It is frustrating that it is taking so long.<\/p><p> It is important to point out that as a result of the revaluation process more companies and businesses have seen a reduction in their rates than have seen an increase.  That is important if we can get the work done on the revaluation and if that trend continues.  The reason that occurs is because it is the cost of the rental of one's property or group of properties relative to the actual cost throughout the local authority area and if companies can show that their rental costs have gone up relative to the average cost in the other parts of the local authority area, they will see a reduction in the rateable valuation.  That is what happened as a result of the revaluations that have occurred so far.<\/p><p> The Government will examine any sensible amendment or proposal which would help to expedite this.  However, the wider issue is that the money must be obtained, and it must be obtained in the fairest way possible.  The best way to achieve that is to get these valuations over the line as soon as we can.  When valuation officers come to a local authority area, they engage with the local businesses.  They have information exchange days and questions and answers.  They go through how the rate is struck in detail.  That greatly helps in terms of revaluation.<\/p><p> I do not disagree with the Deputy.  The retail sector is key.  What we must do is gain confidence across the economy and a fundamental part of that is to keep rates down as far as possible.  We must also ensure we get the funding somewhere.  To do that there must be a fair system across the country.  We are moving on this, because it has not been changed or amended over a period of many years.  We are making progress, although I accept it is slow.  As a result of that progress more businesses are seeing a reduction in their rateable valuation, and that is good news.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300020#S00400","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371125700,"counter":362,"content":"<p>The next two Topical Issues are for the Minister for Health, but we do not have the Minister for Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300021#T00200","speaker":"1020"},{"type":"speech","time":1371125700,"counter":363,"content":"<p>He is not here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300021#T00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1371125700,"counter":364,"content":"<p>It is unacceptable that the Minister for Health is not here.

I acknowledge that the sector plays a key role in meeting the long-term residential care needs of a great many older people.  It is with this in mind that the sector is already an important participant in the ongoing consultation with all stakeholders and the public in general.  This is already a standard feature of the Department's approach across policy areas, including services for older people.  For example, during 2012 extensive public consultation was carried out as part of the development of the national dementia strategy.<\/p><p> When the nursing homes support scheme commenced in October 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The reason for allowing this period to elapse is to ensure trends and statistics will be available in order to inform the work done.

Broughan.  I raised this issue three weeks ago as a parliamentary question and I am still awaiting a reply.  I have requested a Topical Issues debate on five occasions in the interim.  However, none of the three Ministers believed it was worthwhile to come here to address the crisis in the acute psychiatric unit in Roscommon County Hospital.  It requires urgent and immediate action by the Department of Health.<\/p><p>  The crisis has its origin in a decision made last August.  At the time I expressed my serious concerns to senior management.  I expressed my reservations again in April.  On both occasions I was assured that there were adequate provisions in place to cater for all patients and ensure the safety of patients, staff and the community at large.  Despite these assurances, two families have gone public in the past two weeks with a different perspective.  The family of a 38 year old mother who died following a tragic incident in the acute psychiatric unit has called for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding her death.  The family of a second patient has raised another matter.  The patient was seriously assaulted by an outpatient who was subsequently allowed to be in close proximity to the innocent victim owing to the unavailability of appropriate alternative accommodation.  During the same period two female nursing staff were seriously assaulted.  To compound this, in recent months An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been called on a number of occasions to support staff at the unit.<\/p><p>  I am deeply concerned by the range of reports I have received on the capacity of the facility to cater for existing demand and the ongoing needs of the community it serves.  There is no doubt that, from senior management down, the current staffing level in the psychiatric service in County Roscommon is grossly inadequate to deal with the existing caseload of the acute unit.  As a direct result, management has redeployed staff from the community and day services to try to assist with the operation of the unit.  This is leaving service users without day services and vital community supports, thereby putting even further pressure on the acute psychiatric services locally.<\/p><p>  Two steps are required urgently.  First, additional staff must be allocated to the psychiatric service in County Roscommon in the light of the fact that there has been a disproportionate loss of staff as a result of retirements.  Second, long-term involuntary patients should not be accommodated in an acute psychiatric unit.  Steps must be taken to transfer such patients to more appropriate facilities as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300022#U00500","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1371126300,"counter":375,"content":"<p>For years it has been correctly said Governments do not give a damn about people with a mental illness.

In fairness to her, she is not in the country today.  She is representing the Government in Brussels.  On her behalf I thank both Deputies for raising this issue.  I understand the sensitivity of this matter in County Roscommon.<\/p><p>  Addressing the generally accepted historical deficiencies in capital and non-capital aspects of our mental health services remains a priority for, I hope, every Government.  This has been reflected in our programme for Government commitments, with some &euro;70 million provided this year and last year for a range of new posts and other specific initiatives relating to mental health and suicide prevention.  Notwithstanding progress on addressing the overall financial pressures still facing the country, and the demands being placed on all areas of our care system, the mental health budget increased this year from &euro;711 million in 2012 to &euro;733 million this year.  The HSE service plan indicates that Galway-Roscommon local health office will receive in the region of &euro;69 million for mental health services in 2013. <\/p><p>  The Deputies will appreciate that the HSE has statutory and operational responsibility for the planning and delivery of services at local level, including in County Roscommon.  Community and inpatient services are provided in Roscommon and are deemed to be a single entity in the context of the Galway-Roscommon local health office area.  Services include outpatient clinics in various towns in County Roscommon, augmented by community mental health nurses who visit clients in their homes.  Notwithstanding the challenges presented by the need to reform our health services overall, including mental health services, the objectives of change will be undertaken while maintaining safety and quality throughout all of our health services.<\/p><p>  With regard to the acute psychiatric unit in Roscommon, the HSE has indicated that it has regular high activity levels due to the needs of clients and the nature and complexities of their illnesses.  Unfortunately, there have been recent incidents at the inpatient unit, but these were not due to staffing shortages.  At weekends the full complement of nursing staff and senior managers are on duty and a consultant psychiatrist and medical staff are available on call throughout the weekend.  Patients who require treatment are assessed and evaluated by the nursing and medical team.  This is normal practice.  Over recent times there have been staff requirements and resignations, as mentioned by Deputy Naughten, and not all of the staff who left can be replaced owing to the moratorium on recruitment.  As a result, staffing levels are reviewed on a daily basis and members of staff can be relocated according to the needs of the service.  There have also been occasions on which staff are required urgently elsewhere and redeployment occurs.<\/p><p>  In the context of the issue raised, the HSE is seeking to redeploy nurse management in Galway-Roscommon to provide enhanced management and leadership as required in mental health provision.  The House can be assured that the Government is very focused on developing mental health services, not only in Counties Galway and Roscommon but nationwide, in line with A Vision for Change.  The Department of Health will continue to liaise closely with the HSE on the specific issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300023#V00400","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1371126900,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I am extremely disappointed with the response I have received from the Minister of State.  I accept the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is away, but there are two other Ministers in the Department.  This is a serious issue.  The redeployment of management is not the issue.  We need nursing staff in the acute psychiatric unit now.  That message is coming from everyone who is dealing with the service.  We need to ensure that long-term involuntary patients in the acute unit are put into more appropriate settings.  What is happening in the acute unit in Roscommon is akin to a situation in which an older person who requires a nursing home bed is taking up an intensive care bed in a tertiary treatment hospital.  It is unacceptable and cannot continue.

I love the idea that people can be treated in the community and are not stuck unnecessarily in large units.  However, that is not happening, and there is no point in trying to cod people into thinking it is.  In fact, the opposite is happening.  In order to deal with the shortage of staff in the hospital services, staff are being taken from community care, which does not make a lot of sense.  People who could have dealt with their issues in the community no longer have services available to them and are less likely to use them.  As a result, they are more likely to become increasingly mentally ill and to need the unit in Roscommon. <\/p><p>  The Government can say what it wants but it does not change reality.  It is not implementing A Vision for Change or being fair to people in the psychiatric hospital.  They are people who are at their most vulnerable.  Families have contacted me and told me they are terrified to send mentally ill members of their families in that direction because they feel they would be safer at home, unsafe as that is. <\/p><p>  Instead of turning up at runs in aid of Pieta House at 4 a.m., as many Government Deputies did as well as Deputy Naughten and me, we need to get more serious about this.  The Government can cry about it when it is too late, but it should do something before it is too late.  It is not on.

One is the question of the staffing component in the psychiatric unit in Roscommon.  I will direct the HSE to respond to him and Deputy Flanagan on that issue.  The official position is that the complement is there, despite the fact, as he rightly points out, that there has been a significant increase in the number of people who have left the service.  There is an attempt to relocate people who have some knowledge and expertise in this area.  I will ask the HSE to reply to the Deputies directly on the appropriateness of having long-term patients within the setting.<\/p><p>That is a problem right across the system, as the Deputy knows.  I will ask HSE management to reply to him on that issue also.  The question of appropriate settings, particularly in the case of psychiatric units, is very important.  We are seeking to minimise the difficulty for people and to have an environment in which patients and their families can have confidence.<\/p><p> Despite the budgetary difficulties faced by every Department, the information available to me indicates that 21 new posts are currently advertised.  These additional staff will have expertise in the psychiatry of later life, suicide prevention, community mental health, self-harm and liaison psychiatry.  These are the types of professional we need as part and parcel of the service.  The additional personnel are being recruited as a result of the additional funding the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has succeeded in securing in the past 12 months.  In circumstances where budgets are being cut across the board, this is one of the few areas where funding has been extended.  By allocating these additional moneys, doing things differently, relocating personnel and managing the service in a more effective way, I hope we can get to a better position in a timely and transparent way.  I accept that there are issues which must be addressed and will instruct the Health Service Executive to reply directly to the Deputies in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300023#V00800","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2013: Messages from Select Committees","time":1371127500,"counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300024#W00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1371127500,"counter":385,"content":"<p>The Select sub-Committee on Education and Skills has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimate for public services for the service of the year ending 31 December 2013: Vote 26 - Department of Education and Skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300024#W00300","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna - Questions - Priority Questions","time":1371127500,"counter":387,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300024#W00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission","time":1371127500,"counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300024#W00550"},{"type":"question","time":1371127500,"counter":389,"qnumday":1,"qnumall":"[28437\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300024#W00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the discussions, if any, he has held with the Garda Ombudsman over criticisms of the response time of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to queries by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","time":1371127500,"counter":390,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[28435\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300024#W00650","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his initial response to the recently published report of its Public Interest Investigation from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission that outlined serious concerns regarding the ongoing procedures with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the poor level of cooperation with their investigation.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1371127500,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.<\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was established under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to provide for independent oversight of complaints made against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The commission has a hugely important role in ensuring public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded.  It has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.  The 2005 Act also provides for protocols on the sharing of information between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the ombudsman commission.  These protocols set down time limits for the provision of information by the Garda for the commission.  It is clearly important that any such agreed protocols be respected and any difficulties in this regard be addressed.<\/p><p>  I met members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 29 April to discuss the concerns they had raised in their 2012 annual report regarding delays in concluding their investigations and, in particular, delays in receiving requested information from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Concerns regarding Garda response times were also raised by the commissioners in the context of their recent public interest report which dealt with the handling of covert human intelligence sources by the Garda.<\/p><p>  Following criticism in the Morris tribunal report, the Garda put in place revised procedures - a code of practice - for the management and use of covert human intelligence sources, including internal review mechanisms.  In June 2010 the then Minister for Justice and Equality appointed retired High Court Judge Mr. Justice Thomas Smyth as head of an independent oversight authority for covert human intelligence sources.  In addition to monitoring compliance with the code of practice, Mr. Justice Smyth's remit requires him to communicate matters he considers appropriate, including recommendations, to the Garda Commissioner and report to the Minister for Justice and Equality annually on the discharge of his functions.  As part of my response to the report by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, I considered it appropriate to publish the most recent report of Mr. Justice Smyth, in which he indicated his satisfaction that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was in substantial compliance with the code of practice.  I have also given a commitment to publish future reports from Mr. Justice Smyth.<\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's comments and recommendations in regard to procedures for handling covert human intelligence sources do raise a series of important issues.  These are receiving my fullest consideration and, in the first instance, I am consulting Mr. Justice Smyth and the Garda Commissioner about them.  I have also asked the Commissioner for his observations on the concerns expressed by the ombudsman commission in regard to the timely provision of information, following which I intend to convene a meeting with the Commissioner and the ombudsman commission to ensure outstanding issues have been fully resolved.<b><\/b> I expect to receive the Garda Commissioner's views in the next few days and hold the meeting within the next fortnight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300024#W00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1371127500,"counter":392,"content":"<p>The establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has shown that, in the main, members of the Garda do their jobs in a professional and upright manner.

Commenting on the report, the commissioners described the level of co-operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as highly unsatisfactory.  This lack of co-operation, they said, had a \"significant detrimental impact\" on the investigation in terms of time limits and completeness.  That two members of the ombudsman commission were obliged to take to the public airwaves to articulate these concerns is simply not good enough.  I expect the Minister will agree with this.

Its concluding observations covered a wide range of areas which impact on the remit of several Departments.<\/p><p>  The committee recommended on Magdalen laundries<i>:<\/i><blockquote>The State should institute prompt, independent, and thorough investigations into all allegations of torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that were allegedly committed in the Magdalen Laundries and, in appropriate cases, prosecute and punish the perpetrators with penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed, and ensure that all victims obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible.<\/blockquote>  The interdepartmental committee chaired by the former Senator, Mr. Martin McAleese, was not established in response to that recommendation and was never intended to be a criminal investigation but was a necessary preliminary step in establishing general facts.  The Government is satisfied that the McAleese report provides an independent, comprehensive, factual account of the Magdalen institutions.  Some of these institutions had ceased operations nearly 50 years previously and there was no reliable account available of their operations.  It brought into the public arena a considerable amount of information not previously known.  It also showed that many of the preconceptions about these institutions were not supported by the facts.<\/p><p>  With regard to prosecutions, the only mechanism to prosecute and punish perpetrators for offences committed in this jurisdiction requires a criminal investigation, a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute and then a criminal trial.  The law does not provide for any other type of inquiry to lead to criminal prosecutions.  Any complaint of criminal behaviour made by any individual to the Garda regarding Magdalen laundries are matters that can be investigated by the Garda.<\/p><p>  The rapporteur for the follow-up on concluding observations of the UN Committee against Torture has written recently seeking clarification and further information on several matters, including matters relating to Magdalen laundries.  It would be unfair to the UN committee to suggest that such a committee would come to conclusions without hearing from all sides.  Rather, my understanding from the letter is that it is has received information from non-governmental sources that raise issues.  It is now seeking clarification and further information from the State so that it can consider the matter in a fully informed manner.

The process is dragging on and on, and I think the Minister will agree with me on that.  We are not moving along at any degree of pace or with any degree of the urgency that is required.  We are missing all the timelines all the way along.  Can the Minister give us some degree of clarity or certainty as to when cases can be received, cases will be processed and people can test the legislation, which has an inherent bankers' veto built into it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z00400","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":459,"content":"<p>The Deputy should stop throwing stones because he likes to think that people outside this House forget that his party was in government for a continuous period of 14 years and over that period it destroyed the economy and the financial base of the State, contributed to the creation of a property bubble-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":460,"content":"<p>The Minister cheered it on the whole way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z00600","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":461,"content":"<p>-----to ten of thousands of people borrowing beyond their means and to the collapse of the banking system-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":462,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z00800","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Only half a minute remains for the reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z00900","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":464,"content":"<p>-----and, ultimately and totally, it failed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z01000","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":465,"content":"<p>The Minister is not addressing the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z01100","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Deputy, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z01200","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Is the Minister going to address the question or is he going to give his revisionist version of history?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300027#Z01300","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129300,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Deputy, please take your seat.

I do not believe that it would be helpful to pre-empt the publication of the report or the consideration of the matter by Government by going into any detail at this stage.  However, if the Deputy is advocating that any fund or commission should be placed on a statutory footing with independent statutory powers, I presume she is doing so in the knowledge that the preparation and enactment of legislation and the establishment of a new independent body would take several months at a minimum.<\/p><p>  I have already set out the position on the letter recently received from the rapporteur for the follow-up on the concluding observations of the UN Committee Against Torture, UNCAT.  The UN committee issued its concluding observations on Monday, 6 June 2011 following Ireland's first examination in Geneva under Article 19 of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  Its concluding observations covered a wide range of areas that impact on the remit of several Departments.<\/p><p>  The committee recommended in respect of the Magdalen laundries that &quot;the State should institute prompt, independent, and thorough investigations into all allegations of torture, and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that were allegedly committed in the Magdalen Laundries and, in appropriate cases, prosecute and punish the perpetrators with penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed, and ensure that all victims obtain redress and have an enforceable right to compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible&quot;.<\/p><p>  The interdepartmental committee chaired by the former Senator, Dr. McAleese, was not established in response to that recommendation and was never intended to be a criminal investigation.  It was a necessary preliminary step in establishing general facts.  The Government is satisfied that the McAleese report provides an independent, comprehensive, factual account of the Magdalen institutions.  Some of these institutions had ceased operations almost 50 years previously and there was no reliable account available of their operations.  It brought into the public arena a considerable amount of information not previously known.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>It also showed that many of the preconceptions about these institutions were not supported by the facts.<\/p><p>  The only mechanism to prosecute and punish perpetrators for offences committed in this jurisdiction requires a criminal investigation, a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute and then a criminal trial.  Irish law does not provide for any other type of inquiry to lead to criminal prosecutions.  Any complaint of criminal behaviour made by any individual to the Garda in respect of the Magdalen laundries are matters that can be investigated by the Garda.<\/p><p>  The rapporteur is seeking clarification and further information on several matters including matters relating to Magdalen laundries.  It would be unfair to the UN committee to suggest that such a committee would come to conclusions without hearing from all sides.  Rather, my understanding from the letter is that the committee has received information from non-governmental sources that raise issues and it is now seeking clarification and further information from the State in order that it can consider the matter in a fully-informed manner.  As I have stated, a detailed response to the queries raised is being prepared and will be forwarded to the rapporteur through the correct channels in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300028#AA03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129900,"counter":536,"content":"<p>The Minister has referred to no pre-emption in respect of the report from Mr. Justice Quirke.

This has caused serious upset among many women who have contacted me and who are survivors of these institutions.  The Minister has known all along that the survivors are in many cases elderly and some are in poor health.  Therefore, time is of the essence in dealing with these matters.<\/p><p>  The Minister asserted that the McAleese report was not established to meet the recommendations and requirements of the UN committee against torture.  I put it to the Minister that if the McAleese report was not designed to do that then where is the mechanism to meet these requirements?  In its observations of May 2013, to which the Minister referred, the UN committee was particularly critical of the McAleese report.  It stated that the report lacked many elements of a prompt independent and thorough investigation.  It stated that the inquiry did not conduct a full independent investigation into allegations of arbitrary detention, forced labour or ill-treatment.  It further stated that it was concerned that as a consequence Mr. Justice Quirke's work was premised on incomplete investigations carried out by the McAleese committee and it called for clarification on whether the Quirke investigation process and the system envisaged in his recommendations would have independent statutory powers, whether it would be transparent and whether it would have an appeals process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300028#AA03800","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1371129900,"counter":537,"content":"<p>The Minister has one minute to reply.

It involved 28 staff, including five chief superintendents and six superintendents.

The O'Mahoney report, and a related report by the Garda professional standards unit, recommended a number of changes aimed at ensuring administrative procedures are correctly followed throughout the force in relation to the cancellation of fixed charge notices.  I have asked the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to consider these changes prior to implementation to make any necessary supplementary recommendations and to review their implementation after 18 months.  With regard to the need for any further examination of this issue, I have referred both reports to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.

It will be held in the autumn.  The Government also intends to hold a referendum on the establishment of a court of civil appeal on the same day and possibly other issues arising from the early reports of the Constitutional Convention.<\/p><p>  As the Government is proposing this referendum, it is appropriate that I, as Taoiseach, should outline the reasons why we are doing so.  In July 2009, at the MacGill Summer School, I announced that Fine Gael was embarking on a root and branch analysis of the political system.  As part of that analysis, we looked in detail at the role of the Seanad and came to the clear conclusion that reforming it was not realistic or achievable.  The key difficulty with all of the proposals for reform is that they take the existence of the Seanad, with its widely-acknowledged flaws, as a given.  It would either remain an unrepresentative elitist composition or a directly elected entity that would seek to duplicate the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  Instead, the correct approach is to start by asking whether we need a second House at all.  I do not believe we do.  For 75 years political insiders have discussed and debated Seanad reform.  Ten reports on reform of the second House have been published since it was established in 1938, yet not a single one has been implemented.<\/p><p>Many of those who ignored Seanad and D&aacute;il reform when in power have argued vigorously against the holding of a referendum, yet it is the Constitution that declares the people are sovereign.  What could be more appropriate or more democratic than asking the people to decide on the future of the Seanad following 75 years of inaction by the political establishment?<\/p><p> The proposed abolition of the Seanad is part of the Government's comprehensive programme of political reform.  This is a programme that will establish a new politics in our Republic - one that is more accountable, more democratic and more responsive.  It is time to create a new political system that will put people's faith and hope back into Irish politics.  This Government's proposals to modernise the political system with major reform of the D&aacute;il and abolition of the Seanad, the most radical reform of local government in 100 years and the establishment of a Constitutional Convention to review the country's supreme law represent the biggest package of political reform since the passing of the Constitution in 1937.  We have cut the number of Deputies and increased the number of D&aacute;il sitting days.  We have reduced the pay and allowances of all politicians.  We have halved the cost of ministerial transport.  We are already radically reforming local government, reducing the number of local authorities from 114 to 31 and the number of councillors from 1,600 to 950.  However, the truth is that we still have too many politicians in Ireland.  When combined with a reduction of eight in the number of Deputies, the abolition of the Seanad will enable this country to cut the number of public representatives by almost one-third.  It has been estimated that abolition will save up to &euro;20 million per annum over time on the running costs of the Oireachtas.  I make no apology for seeking to cut the cost of politics in Ireland.  There is something fundamentally wrong with politicians asking others to change - asking the citizens of this country to make real sacrifices - and not doing the same ourselves.  The reason Ireland has significantly more politicians than other small countries is very simple: we have a second House.  Five European countries have approximately the same population as Ireland, between 4 million and 6 million.  These are Denmark, Finland, Norway, Croatia and Slovakia.  None of them has a Senate.<\/p><p> No Government would seek to abolish a House of Parliament simply to reduce the number of politicians.  We are in favour of abolition because the Seanad has not worked.  It is an outdated institution that owes more to 1930s vocationalist ideas than it does to modern constitutional thinking.  The theory on which the Seanad is based is no longer relevant and its elitist composition does not reflect modern Irish society.  Parliamentary democracy has moved on around the world.  Maintaining a House of Parliament in which 43 Members are elected by a tiny electorate, with six elected by an incomplete third-level electorate and 11 nominated by the Taoiseach of the day, is simply not defensible.<\/p><p> The following critique of the Seanad summarises the case for its abolition very well:<blockquote>Much of the rationale for the inclusion of the Seanad in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann has ceased to be relevant over time.  Serious questions must be asked about the continued role of an entity which is still struggling to justify its existence after three-quarters of a century.  <\/blockquote>The critique also states: &quot;It is important to note that second chambers are not an essential part of parliamentary democracy.&quot;  If these words sound familiar to the Members, they should.  This damning critique of the Seanad was contained in Fianna Fail's election manifesto of 2011.  Supporters of Seanad retention are deeply divided about the kind of reformed Seanad they want.  Some want it to be an elected second D&aacute;il and others want it to be a House of experts, while others want some form of citizens' assembly.  It is precisely this lack of consensus which means that reform has never happened and never will happen.  The experience of Canada suggests that the &quot;no reform&quot; option is the most likely outcome.  There have been more than 20 major proposals for constitutional Senate reform in Canada since the early 1970s and all have failed.<\/p><p> The contention that a second House is crucial to democracy is simply untrue.  All of the Scandinavian countries have abolished their second Houses.  These countries have some of the most accountable and effective political systems in the world.  Other small successful countries, such as New Zealand, have shown that it is perfectly possible to establish checks and balances within a single-chamber, unicameral Parliament.  Most of the new nations in central and eastern Europe have also decided that they do not need a Senate.  If a second House is so central to democracy, as some would maintain, why have so many of these emerging democracies decided to do without one?  In a strong, long-established parliamentary democracy such as ours, a second Chamber is even less of a requirement.<\/p><p> The correct approach is to start by asking whether we need a second House.  The Government believes that a second Chamber is no more necessary here in Ireland than it is in other small unitary states.  We believe that a reformed D&aacute;il can give this country a fit-for-purpose Parliament - one that fully meets the needs of a 21st-century democracy.  As I said, we have started the process of real D&aacute;il reform.  Much more is obviously needed.  The Government believes that, in tandem with the abolition of the Seanad, further change is required to strengthen the role of the D&aacute;il.  First, we will reform the way in which the D&aacute;il deals with legislation.  Legislation will first be submitted to the relevant D&aacute;il committee in heads of Bill format.  This means that suggestions for changes in legislation can be considered and any key flaws identified before the full legislation is even published.  To allow for extra consideration and scrutiny of legislation in the D&aacute;il, a new schedule will increase the time allocated to legislation.  I expect that four-day sittings will become the weekly norm.  Each Bill will be referred back to the committee that originally considered it for a final examination.  Furthermore, a Minister will have to revert to the relevant D&aacute;il committee within 12 months of the enactment of a Bill to review and discuss its functioning and effectiveness.  This new legislative process will ensure, therefore, that legislation is fully considered before, during and after its enactment.  We will empower committees to carry out investigations and inquiries into matters of major public importance.  The legislation to give effect to this has recently been published.  <\/p><p> Furthermore, we propose to radically overhaul the committee system in the D&aacute;il.  A total of 14 D&aacute;il committees will be established.  Each committee will have 12 members and will be able to invite external experts to provide specialist input into its work.  The Government has been impressed by how the expert panel has contributed to the work of the Constitutional Convention and will examine how a similar type of panel could contribute to the work of D&aacute;il committees.  We also believe that the independence of committees should be strengthened.  We will, therefore, introduce the d'Hondt system to distribute chairs of key committees on a proportional and equitable basis.  If this is approved by the people, the Government and I are convinced that we will create a better, more effective political system with better accountability, better oversight and deeper scrutiny of legislation.<\/p><p> I will say a few words about the Bill itself.  The Bill provides that Seanad &Eacute;ireann will be abolished from midnight on the day immediately before the day on which D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann first meets after the next general election, and that from abolition day the Oireachtas will consist of the President and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann only.  Articles 18 and 19 of the Constitution, which deal with the composition of the Seanad, elections and nominations to it, etc., will be deleted, and the Bill provides that no general election to the Seanad will take place after the next dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  As a consequence of abolishing the Seanad, it will be necessary to amend or delete all articles in the Constitution that either relate directly to the functions of the Seanad or are premised on the existence of that House.  Many of these changes are purely technical.  They will be made to articles that deal primarily with matters that are not directly related to the powers or functions of the Seanad.  <\/p><p> Other references in the Constitution do relate to the functions of the Seanad and I will say a few words about these.  The function that may come first in people's minds is the Seanad's legislative role.  As a consequence of abolishing the Seanad, the articles in the Constitution relating to the Oireachtas legislative process will have to be amended or, where appropriate, deleted.<\/p><p>Articles 20, 21, 23 and 24, which deal with the relationship between the D&aacute;il and Seanad with regard to the passage of legislation through the Houses, will be deleted as they will no longer be needed in a unicameral parliament.<\/p><p> Article 20 deals with the initiation of Bills in either House and the Seanad's power to amend Bills while Article 21 limits the Seanad's powers as regards Money Bills and the time within which it must consider them.  Article 23 deals mainly with the time for the Seanad to consider other non-Money Bills while Article 24 provides that where the Taoiseach certifies that in the Government's opinion a Bill is immediately necessary to preserve public peace and security in an emergency, the Seanad's time for considering the Bill can be shortened by a resolution of the D&aacute;il if the President so agrees.<\/p><p> As well as deleting these articles, it will be necessary to amend Article 22 which deals with Money Bills.  Article 22<i><\/i>defines a Money Bill and provides a mechanism to resolve a dispute between the D&aacute;il and Seanad on whether a Bill is a Money Bill.  The Article 22<i><\/i>procedure relates only to whether a Bill is a Money Bill: it is not concerned with the merits or otherwise of the Bill.  The reason it is proposed to retain and amend this article is because under the Constitution the President cannot refer a Money Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.  Nevertheless, to provide clarity on whether a Bill is a Money Bill in the context of the possibility of a reference to the Supreme Court by a citizen, there is a need to retain an Article 22 procedure.  The Bill, therefore, proposes that the Ceann Comhairle's certificate that a Bill is a Money Bill shall be final and conclusive unless the D&aacute;il resolves that it is not a Money Bill.  The Article 22 mechanism has never been used.<\/p><p> The Bill proposes to delete Article 27<i><\/i>of the Constitution.  This article provides for the possibility of a petition from a majority of the members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and at least one third of the members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to the President to refer a Bill to the people on the grounds that it &quot;contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained.&quot;  The President must consult the Council of State before deciding whether to agree to the petition.  This procedure does not apply to Money Bills or to Bills to amend the Constitution.  It applies only to Bills which are deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas under Article 23 of the Constitution.<i><\/i>This means that it applies only to a Bill that is not passed or rejected by the Seanad within 90 days or that is passed by that House with amendments that are not agreed by the D&aacute;il.  Also, for Article 27 to apply, the D&aacute;il must have passed a resolution to deem the Bill to have been passed by both Houses.  Essentially, Article 27 provides a way of resolving a dispute between the two Houses on a legislative matter.  Once the Seanad has been abolished there will no longer be a need for this provision and consequently the Bill proposes its deletion.  The Article 27 procedure has never been used.<\/p><p> I want now to deal with a number of items that while not relating directly to Bills that come before the Seanad involve the Seanad in actions relating to legislation or measures proposed by the Government.  Article 28.3 provides immunity from challenge on constitutional grounds of any law, other than one imposing the death penalty, that is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or around rebellion.  The article provides that the term &quot;time of war&quot; includes a time when there is an armed conflict in which the State is not a participant but where each House of the Oireachtas has resolved that arising out of the armed conflict a national emergency exists affecting the vital interests of the State.  The article also provides that the expression &quot;time of war or armed rebellion&quot; includes such time after the end of the war, armed conflict or rebellion, as may elapse until each of the Houses of the Oireachtas has resolved that the national emergency has ended.  The powers in this article for each House will, with the abolition of the Seanad, necessarily reside in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p> Articles 29.4.7&deg; and 29.4.8&deg; relate to the exercise by the State of certain powers conferred on the State under certain provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.  The State may exercise these powers only with the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Article 29.4.7&deg; concerns the exercise by the State of options in relation to enhanced co-operation, Schengen and the position of Ireland and the UK on freedom, security and justice matters.  Article 29.4.8&deg; relates to the State proposing to agree to authorise the Council to act other than by unanimity, to agree to authorise the adoption of the ordinary legislative procedure or to agree to certain decisions in the area of judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  The abolition of the Seanad will mean that the power of approval will reside in the D&aacute;il alone.  I believe it is far more satisfactory that it will be for a democratically-elected House to make approval decisions in this area.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I will now address the role of the Seanad in the procedures laid down in the Constitution for the removal of certain officeholders.  In the case of the impeachment of a President, abolition of the Seanad will remove the current arrangement whereby the House that prefers a charge of stated misbehaviour against the President cannot be the House that investigates that charge.  To ensure the highest level of protection for the independence of the Office of President, the Government has carefully considered this procedure and is proposing in the Bill that a resolution to prefer a charge against the President, and if an investigation sustains that charge, a resolution to remove the President must each be passed by four fifths of the total membership of the D&aacute;il.  The current requirement in this regard is two thirds of the total membership of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p><b><\/b>In the case of impeachment of the Comptroller and Auditor General and members of the Judiciary, the Government has also considered the procedure in the Constitution for removal of the Comptroller and Auditor General - Article 33 - and of Supreme and High Court Judges under Article 35.  The removal of the C&amp;amp;AG requires a resolution not only of the D&aacute;il but also of the Seanad.  While no C&amp;amp;AG has ever been removed from office, the abolition of the Seanad raises the question of whether some additional safeguard should be provided for the independence of that office.  The independence of the Judiciary is central to our system of government and the constitutional balance of powers.  This is reflected in the fact that, as in the case of the C&amp;amp;AG, a resolution to remove from office a judge of the Supreme or High Court must be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Government is eager to ensure continued independence for these offices.  Accordingly, it is proposed that two thirds of the total membership of the D&aacute;il be required to remove either the C&amp;amp;AG or a judge of the Supreme or High Court.<\/p><p> The Bill also proposes that, following abolition of the Seanad, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will replace the Cathaoirleach on the Presidential Commission under Article 14.  Abolition of the Seanad would reduce parliamentary representation on the Presidential Commission to one member and would reduce membership of the commission to two.  To maintain the current constitutional balance between parliamentarians and the Judiciary on the commission, it is proposed that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, given that the office is already mentioned in this article, will replace the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad as a member of the commission.  It is also necessary to designate substitutes should they be unavailable.  Accordingly, the Bill provides that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall, as soon as may be after it reassembles following a general election, nominate two members to act as substitutes for the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle should either or both be unable to act on the commission.  In keeping with the approach proposed in relation to the membership of the Presidential Commission, the Bill proposes that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should replace the Cathaoirleach on the Council of State.  Article 31 will be amended accordingly.<\/p><p> Turning to other matters, the Bill proposes to amend Article 12.4 of the Constitution to provide that no fewer than 14 serving members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann may nominate a candidate for President.  Currently, a nomination under this provision requires no fewer than 20 members of both Houses.<\/p><p>This reduction is proposed in the light of the proposal to abolish the Seanad, as well as the planned reduction in the number of Deputies after the next general election.  The combined effect of these changes will be to reduce the overall number of Members of the Oireachtas from 226 to 158.  The reduction proposed in the Bill, therefore, is designed to retain the existing ratio between the overall number of Members eligible to nominate a presidential candidate and the number of nominations required to secure a nomination.<\/p><p> With the other necessary provisions arising from the amendment of the Constitution, the Bill also provides for the insertion of a new Article 50A to cater for the transitional arrangements that will be necessary in the move from a bicameral to a unicameral parliamentary system.  It provides that any Bill not passed or deemed to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before abolition of the Seanad will be deemed to have lapsed.  Any such Bill may, however, be introduced or reintroduced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann following its reassembly after the general election.  It also provides that any Bill passed or deemed to be passed by both Houses but which has not been enacted before the abolition of the Seanad can complete the process of signing and promulgation into law.  The Bill also provides that any procedure to remove the President, the Comptroller and Auditor General or a judge of the Supreme or the High Court or of any new court not completed prior to abolition of the Seanad will lapse.  Any such procedure can be initiated again under the new provisions of the Constitution set out in the Bill.  If, however, in relation to the removal of the Comptroller and Auditor General or a judge of the Supreme or the High Court, the only remaining procedure is for the President to act on foot of resolutions from both Houses, the President may complete that procedure.<\/p><p> I should end this part of my remarks by drawing the attention of the House to a minor constitutional curiosity.  The transitory provisions set out in Articles 51 to 63, inclusive, of the Constitution provided for the transition between the Irish Free State and the new State created by the 1937 Constitution.  While the transitory provisions, as they themselves require, are not published in official texts of the Constitution, the Bill proposes to delete two of them.  Article 53 deals with the election and assembly of Seanad &Eacute;ireann after the coming into operation of the 1937 Constitution.  Article 55 dealt with the composition of the Oireachtas and the signing and promulgation of Bills passed by it in the period between the coming into operation of the Constitution and the entry into office of the President.  It provided for the signing of Bills by the Presidential Commission during that period.  Both articles will now be deleted.<\/p><p> The people have demanded a new politics that is leaner, more responsive and more democratic.  They want a politics that can truly meet the needs and demands of 21st century Ireland.  In putting forward the Bill I recognise that it is the people who will have the final say on the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and major political reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300030#CC02600","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371132900,"counter":603,"content":"<p>The amendment proposed to the House is the most extensive produced by any Government in the 76 years since Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann was adopted by the people.  It seeks to amend more than 40 provisions of the Constitution but has been prepared without consultation.  No public or private body, let alone any elected representative outside the Government, has been asked for an input.  No supporting studies have been published.  This is a proposal to hack out a significant part of the Constitution purely on the basis that the Government wishes to claim it is reforming politics.  Never before has a Government proposed an amendment to the Constitution which involved so much change and so little reform.  The manner in which the amendment has been prepared is a powerful demonstration of the strongest reason people should fear its impact.  A Government which already has too much power is seeking even more.  The Taoiseach is entirely right to say the Bill is historic.  It is historic because it marks the moment that a Government elected on the promise of deep reform decided to bury any chance for real reform.  It marks the moment when this Fine Gael and Labour Party Government has confirmed that its only agenda is to keep concentrating ever more power in its own hands.<\/p><p>  The Government's proposal is radical only because it ignores every lesson of the recent crisis.  Rather than opening up politics, introducing new checks and balances within the system and delivering a more effective Parliament, the Government has chosen to double-down on the current model of governance.  The amendment seeks to increase the power of the Government, halve the parliamentary review of legislation and make a flawed system much worse.  It will not reform Irish politics but will, in fact, mark the end of any chance to reform it.  Fundamentally, this is not purely a debate about the future of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  What we are beginning is a debate on whether there will be any reform of Irish politics.  If the Government succeeds with its plans, we will carry on with an even more concentrated form of a system which has clearly failed in vital areas.<\/p><p>  Five years into an unprecedented economic and political crisis and two and a half years after an election which completely changed the make-up of this House, there has been not one significant change made to the structure of government.  While there has been a dramatic increase in claims to have reformed government, the exact opposite is the reality, which can be seen every day.  Many minor changes have been implemented, but the basic structure of decision-making and governance in Ireland remains absolutely untouched.  During their time in opposition,  Fine Gael and the Labour Party - their leaders, in particular - developed a certain approach to politics.  This was to always find a villain and offer soundbites rather than solutions.  It was a public relations-led strategy, which has also become a defining characteristic of their Government.  They believe that if they keep making a claim, people will eventually accept it.  Of course, anyone who spends time talking to people in their homes and communities knows that this has stopped working.  At the core of the Government's low level of public trust is a near universal belief that there is no link between its rhetoric and the reality of its actions.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach has spoken again today about reforming the D&aacute;il, but the House should remember that for two years he has been claiming that the D&aacute;il is already reformed.  A few months after taking up office, the Government pushed through a series of changes to D&aacute;il proceedings.  Opposition proposals were ignored, but a major media effort was undertaken to talk about how fundamental reform was being implemented.  There was some success in persuading commentators to talk about a new dawn in the D&aacute;il.  The Chief Whip came to the House and made a statement about what Deputies would find on the next sitting day.  He said:<blockquote>They will return to a D&aacute;il where Members can play a more active and meaningful role in the legislative process and where Members will have more opportunity to raise issues with Ministers in a more effective manner.  They will return to a D&aacute;il better equipped to hold the Executive to account, a D&aacute;il that has started to turn back the tide and to recover some of the power it has been losing to the Executive for over a decade.<\/blockquote>When we returned on the next sitting day and on every sitting day since, we have faced an Executive exerting ever tighter control over everything we do.  We have faced Ministers who believe they do not have to answer even basic questions about their decisions.  We have faced a determined policy to shout down opponents and shut down debate.  We have met for longer but have been allowed to decide less.<\/p><p>  The D&aacute;il today is more marginalised and has less influence on public affairs than at any time in its 94 year history.  The situation is so bad that even the Chief Whip has this week been forced to acknowledge that the Government's record is &quot;deplorable&quot;.  The same thing has been happening in nearly every Department.  While Ministers put out releases praising their own visionary reforms, all that happens is that they gain more power.  A succession of Bills have been introduced which increase the direct power of Ministers and reduce independent input and oversight.  In areas as diverse as health and basic research Ministers have been giving themselves greater direct control.   The word &quot;reform&quot; has been abused so much by the Government that it has been reduced to Orwellian newspeak and drained of any meaning.<\/p><p>The abolition of the Seanad and the concentration of all legislative functions in a D&aacute;il tightly controlled by the Government is nothing less than a cynical power grab.  It is a rejection of a more open democracy, a rejection of genuine accountability and a betrayal of the commitment made to the people to change the way Ireland is governed.<\/p><p> Just as the claims for having delivered reform are bogus, so too are the arguments being used to promote the amendment.  From the moment of launching the amendment to his speech opening the debate, the Taoiseach has used a mixture of exaggeration and misrepresentation to promote his record and to attack the Seanad.  There has been no attempt to engage with the issue of reform.  Unlike previous taoisigh of different parties, the Taoiseach has approached the amending of our constitutional law in a deeply partisan manner.  The Taoiseach was asked on dozens of occasions to hold cross-party consultations.  He refused, and he refused even to allow the issue to be discussed at the Constitutional Convention, the forum that is supposed to be in charge of recommending constitutional reform.<\/p><p> This is the first time in over 40 years that a Government is seeking to make a significant amendment of the Constitution without publishing any background material to justify the measure.  As it has been from the evening it was announced at a Fine Gael dinner, it is gesture politics designed to cover up a lack of substantive policies.  There is no thought-through strategy behind it and no area of public policy that will be improved because of it.  Arising from his tribal refusal to acknowledge the achievements of figures from different political traditions, the Taoiseach allowed the 75th anniversary of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to pass without comment.  In preparation for this debate, he would have been well served by taking the time to read Mr. Justice Hogan&rsquo;s book on the origins and drafting of the Constitution.  It shows an incredible level of debate and consultation, which ensured the Constitution was reflective of extremely modern conceptions and entrenched liberal democracy at a time when it was under siege from fascism and communism throughout Europe.  In a radical decision, which has been an anchor of democracy in this State ever since, Eamon de Valera proposed that the majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann would lose the right to amend the Constitution and sought ways to broaden the voices in the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300033#FF00200","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371133500,"counter":605,"content":"<p>He abolished it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300034#GG00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1371133500,"counter":606,"content":"<p>He had earlier abolished the Free State Senate because it sought to prevent the implementation of key republican principles in the Constitution, but he restored it in the 1937 document.  Eamon de Valera actively sought out different opinions and the record shows how he was respectful of other opinions.  He even managed to handle with good grace the claim of James Dillon that he was introducing a dictatorship.<\/p><p>  The record also shows how W. T. Cosgrave approached the creation of a second Chamber in a generous way.  He consulted widely and absolutely understood that the new Senate would make Government control more difficult.  In the manner in which he has prepared and introduced this amendment, the Taoiseach has departed from the tradition of openness and respectful consultation that defined the approach of his predecessors to the issue.<\/p><p>  In the referendum on Oireachtas inquiries, the Government lost a measure that started with general approval because it showed contempt for anyone who opposed it.  It refused to step away from a hyper-partisan campaign and got a stinging response from the people.  <\/p><p>  The Taoiseach knows that not a single person in this House or in Seanad &Eacute;ireann is happy with the role of the Seanad.  It is badly constituted and it has not been a dynamic presence in our democracy, but to try to construct a case whereby it has all of the ills of our country heaped on its shoulders is ridiculous, as is the refusal to acknowledge its many positive contributions to the State.  Over many decades there have been reports recommending specific reforms and they have been ignored.  I fully acknowledge that I and my party, just like the other parties here who have been in government, failed to act on the reports.  We were comfortable just letting things proceed as they were.  The failure to reform the Seanad before now is not the Seanad's fault; it is our fault in this House.<\/p><p>  In a very bad sign of the approach the Government appears likely to take in this campaign, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, wrote in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i> deliberately cherry-picking and misrepresenting my past comments, as the Taoiseach has done today.  This empty opposition research is to be found in the Fine Gael notes for this debate.  We will hear it repeatedly.  This is what its members do every day.  They have refused to acknowledge the context of the words they quote and refused to acknowledge the Taoiseach's stirring defence of the Seanad at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties.<\/p><p>  In drawing up our manifesto for the last election, my party developed a series of proposals for reforming politics that were especially radical in terms of reform of the Oireachtas and the Government.  We set out proposals for separating the core work of legislators and Ministers, opening up the political agenda and redirecting our work to be more strategic and expert-based.  We stated that only in the context of these genuinely radical reforms would there no longer be a need for the Seanad.  Members can write all the misleading articles they want but they will not find a statement from me in which I support the abolition of the Seanad without a fundamental constitutional reform of the D&aacute;il and the Government.  Since then, the Government has refused to consider any of the major reforms we proposed.  More seriously, we have seen what happens when a Government has a majority so large that it can brush aside any uncomfortable questions.  <\/p><p>  It has become obvious that the single most important reform our politics needs is a parliament that has the capacity to act as a check on the Executive.  We have a non-Executive Presidency, which serves us well and provides a focus of unity even at times of great division.  Therefore, the need for a second Chamber, which has the potential to act independently of Government, has become clearer.  The arrogant and unaccountable behaviour of the Government in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has made the most powerful case for retaining a second Chamber of the Oireachtas.  While the Government is again talking about reforming the D&aacute;il in tandem with abolishing the Seanad, it has chosen to propose no change to the constitutional provisions relating to the D&aacute;il.  Therefore, the Government cannot deny that the proposal it wishes to put to the people is simply to abolish the Seanad and give its powers to an unreformed D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>  In recent weeks and again today, the Taoiseach has advanced a wide range of arguments for making more than 40 changes to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in order to abolish the Seanad.  It is worth taking the time to examine the major ones in order to see exactly how empty the case for this amendment is.  The Taoiseach's most consistently used argument is that we should have only one House of Parliament because this is how most small and medium-sized countries in Europe do it.  In particular, the Taoiseach has claimed that we would come into line with the practice in Nordic countries, whose standards of governance we should aspire to.<\/p><p>  The truth is entirely different.  The Government's proposal would give Ireland a parliamentary system unique in the world.  No other country has one chamber of parliament combined with a non-Executive President, weak local government and total control by the Government of the agenda of parliament.  The Nordic countries actually provide very strong arguments against what is being proposed.  Not one of them has a parliamentary system that looks even vaguely like what the Government is proposing.  Finland provides a good comparison.  It has a unicameral system that is profoundly different from ours.  While Finland has recently reduced its President's powers, he is still a principal leader in foreign affairs and has major influence on the government's formation.  Finland has 200 Members of Parliament and a constitution that gives them powers beyond anything held by Deputies in this House.  Key parliamentary committees have constitutional status and have built a long record of acting independently.  They have never had a case of Government sources briefing against a committee chairman in a campaign to have him removed before an important investigation.  The Finnish constitution also gives members of parliament specific rights to get information from any Government agency and it requires Ministers to attend for rigorous questioning when it is demanded by 10% of members of parliament.  It would not be possible for a Finnish Minister to refuse to answer specific questions about the abuse of information given to him by the head of the police.  Many parliamentary rules cannot be changed without broad consensus.  In addition, it has strong local government with more councillors than we do and councils that control major areas of public spending and revenue raising.  In the search for a justification for abolishing the Seanad and giving more power to a Government-dominated D&aacute;il, no country in Europe or anywhere else backs up the Government's claims.<\/p><p>The evidence from abroad is that the Government should have less control, not more, as is now being proposed.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach has also stated the Seanad must be abolished because of its cost.  At the launch of the amendment last week he and the T&aacute;naiste claimed that we would save &euro;20 million every year from abolition.  This argument falls apart on basic examination.  First and most importantly, nobody can doubt that the poor functioning of the Oireachtas was an element of the cause of the current crisis.  Our work was not expert or strategic enough.  In an economy of over &euro;160 billion, with public expenditure of almost &euro;55 billion, a properly functioning parliament is important economically.  It can and should benefit the State and the economy in terms which would dwarf its actual annual costs.  We must ensure we keep the costs of the Oireachtas as low as possible, but we must also ensure the Oireachtas is effective in its economic and fiscal work.  Concentrating all powers in a Government-dominated D&aacute;il is not the way to achieve this.<\/p><p> While the cost of a second Chamber of the Oireachtas can be justified in economic and fiscal terms, we cannot even trust the figures the Government provides for what these costs are.  Last week the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste claimed that we would save &euro;20 million per year if we were to abolish the Seanad.  The evidence shows that this is untrue.  The Accounting Officer, legally responsible for the expenditure of the Oireachtas, has stated the savings would be half the figure claimed.  When a figure net of tax and other revenues is used, the savings are half again.  Whatever way one examines the Taoiseach's claim of major savings from abolition, the facts do not support him.<\/p><p> On top of this, there is the cost of the referendum.  In response to a question I tabled earlier this year the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, stated the cost of holding a referendum on one item, with no other election on the same day, was over &euro;14 million.  This referendum will not take one cent off the level of cuts to be imposed in the next three years.  In fact, because the deficit targets are not being changed, it will increase the size of the required cuts by over &euro;14 million.  This is &euro;14 million extra from schools, hospitals and policing at a time when every cent counts.  If a primary concern of ours is to save the State as much money as possible in its time of greatest need, abandoning this referendum would be the appropriate start.<\/p><p> In a ridiculous comment last week the Taoiseach said we should abolish the Seanad because it had not stopped the financial crisis.  As the man who was the leader of the largest Opposition party for the six years before the crisis, the Taoiseach was in a much stronger position to advocate alternative policies than any Senator.  The record shows that he demanded even more spending, less tax and did not propose policies which would have avoided the crisis.  In the years before 2008 D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann spent more time debating a Fine Gael proposal on greyhound doping than debating financial regulation.  The Taoiseach knows enough about the Constitution to know that the Seanad is precluded from having any power on matters of tax and expenditure.  He is attacking it for failing to use powers it did not have.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach is also promoting a view of the Seanad as being without achievements.  This is a travesty of history.  During the years many distinguished Irish men and women have served in the Seanad and made a significant and positive contribution to Irish life.  The Seanad has provided an essential forum for diverse opinions which would otherwise have had no voice in public life.  On a more practical level, it has performed the role of a substantial contributor to legislation.  The majority of Bills which the Seanad is empowered to amend are amended there.  Equally, the Seanad regularly amends Bills which have already been passed by the D&aacute;il.  Only if one believes thousands of amendments have been irrelevant can one argue that the Seanad has failed to play an important role in legislation.  The Government has made many empty claims during its term to date, but none can match the idea that halving the opportunities to review legislation will deliver better legislation.<\/p><p> I have never been a Member of the Seanad, but I brought a great deal of legislation through that House and have responded to many of its debates.  Seanad debates are always more civil and generally more informed than those held in the D&aacute;il.  As a matter of course they discourage partisan comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300034#GG00300","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371134100,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Was the Deputy listening this week?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300035#HH00200","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1371134100,"counter":609,"content":"<p>There is no example in its history to compare with the recent habit of many Government Deputies systematically heckling Opposition speakers to protect Ministers who have legitimate questions to answer.<\/p><p>  None of this is to say the Seanad should remain as it is.

It is also the case that it is hard to justify giving an extra opportunity to vote for Members of Parliament to people based on their level of education, although there were historical arguments for it.  That said, many systems have minor anachronisms in parliaments which make them less than fully representative.  The reform Bill proposed by Senators Katherine Zappone and Feargal Quinn is a positive one, which we support and which shows what can be achieved quickly to increase the effectiveness of the Oireachtas.  The fact that the Government is denying us the opportunity even to vote on it is an eloquent testimony to its dismissive approach to others.<\/p><p>  Changing the constitutional provisions concerning the Seanad is something which should be done but only in the context of also changing the provisions relating to the D&aacute;il and the Government.  The Taoiseach has again claimed that he will reform the D&aacute;il and make his Government more accountable if the Seanad is abolished.  Like St. Augustine, he is saying, &quot;O Lord make me pure but not yet.&quot;  The programme of supposed reforms which will be delivered following abolition is so thin as to be transparent.  The supposedly radical change to committees about which the media were briefed last week involves changing only one of the current committees.  The rest remain in their current configuration.<\/p><p>  The allocation of committee Chairs proportionately is a positive proposal.  What the Taoiseach does not acknowledge, however, is that his Government was the first in decades to remove all Opposition Deputies from any agenda setting position on the committees which oversee Ministers in their core day-to-day work.  His supposed reform is mainly about reversing his own actions.  The proposal to require non-urgent Bills to be circulated in draft stage is a continuation of the practice started by the former Deputy Eamon Ryan in the last D&aacute;il.  It is also a practice which is irrelevant if the Government adopts the policy of rejecting nearly all amendments and imposing the guillotine at an unprecedented rate.  In recent years parties have campaigned for a European treaty partly on the basis that it introduced a citizens' initiative to the legislative process.  Without explanation, the Government is proposing to remove our constitutional provision for a citizens' initiative.<\/p><p>  In all, the sum total of the reform to follow concentrating all power in the Government controlled D&aacute;il is that we might have a little more consultation and be allowed to influence the agenda of a few committees.  In essence, that is what the Taoiseach is proposing.  The reality of how little this means was summed up unwittingly by the Taoiseach recently when I sought discussion of a reform of Taoiseach's questions.  He said: &quot;We will have a chat about the matter before we make it a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.&quot;  Ultimately, this is a Government which believes it should have absolute control over every element of our work.  It talks about accountability but works against it every time a serious issue is raised.  Even when it is willing to hold advance discussions, it always presents the Oireachtas with a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.<\/p><p>  The final argument the Taoiseach has used to force this measure through with unjustified haste is that it must be done because it was in Fine Gael's manifesto.  There are five Deputies who have been expelled from Fine Gael and the Labour Party because they wanted to vote for the policies in their manifestos.  Why is this promise more important than protecting child benefit or special needs education?  Why is it more morally important to abolish the Seanad than to honour promises to local hospitals?  Why is a solemn pledge to reform rental contracts which are destroying thousands of businesses and jobs to be ignored but Members are to be threatened with expulsion if they vote against abolishing the Seanad?<\/p><p>  Having spent years obsessed with attaining power, the Government is now focused on expanding and keeping hold of its power.  Abolishing the Seanad and concentrating its powers in a place more directly controlled by the Government is the proposal which is its priority change to the way Ireland is governed.  The Government has reviewed the Constitution and found 40 changes it wishes to make, none of which involves handing over a single area of power in the hands of the Taoiseach and the Cabinet.  If this amendment passes into law, Ireland will have a governing system unique in the developed world for the amount of power it concentrates in the hands of Ministers.  It will take a major step away from the models of accountability which dominate in other European countries.  The Government will have spent scarce resources at a time of our greatest financial need in order to achieve a small longer term saving.  Most of all, if the amendment succeeds, it will spell the end of any realistic hope Irish politics will be reformed.  On the other hand, if it is defeated, the Government will have been sent a message that its power grab has failed and that the people want real reform.  It is because of the behaviour of the Government in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, its growing contempt for differing opinions and its dismissive approach to accountability that we need greater parliamentary oversight, not less.  The experience of the past two years is a powerful argument to retain and reform Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p><p>That is why my party and I will vote against this Bill in the Oireachtas and campaign against abolition before the referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300035#HH00300","speaker":"992","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371134700,"counter":611,"content":"<p>The real starting point of this discussion should have been about how best we can organise our democracy and governmental system, and about how this could best be done in the context of creating an inclusive society on this island while reaching out to the diaspora.<\/p><p>  The Ceann Comhairle will be pleased to learn I do not intend to set  out a full critique of Irish society at this time; suffice it to say we live in a partitioned island.  Members present forget that.  That reality shapes society in all parts of the island.  The institutions of this State are deeply partitionist.  They are also corrupt, as evidenced in the range of tribunal reports over recent years.  It goes deeper than that, however.  Partition created two conservative states, ruled by two conservative elites.  The political culture was weighted against citizens' rights and both states have been characterised by economic failure, emigration, inequality and the failure to protect the most vulnerable citizens.  If we are to tackle these issues effectively then we need to have an all-Ireland view.<\/p><p>  The most significant political reform since partition has been the Good Friday Agreement.  The impact of this is most obvious in the North but not so obvious in this part of the island.  None of the reforms, safeguards or checks and balances of the Agreement has been inculcated into our institutions here.  Why not?<\/p><p>  The Government should be actively pressing ahead with the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, including those aspects that impinge on us here.  I refer to the creation of more areas of co-operation and implementation and greater harmonisation; the strengthening of the protection of human rights, including through a charter of rights for the island; and a forum for consideration of human rights issues in the island, as included in the Agreement.<\/p><p><i><\/i>The centenary of the 1916 Rising and Proclamation is approaching.  It is often cited by establishment parties in this Oireachtas as the foundation of the State.  The 1916 leaders are frequently described as the founders of this State.  The Proclamation was not the foundation of this State.  The leaders were not the founders of this State.  This State is the product of the counter-revolution that followed the Rising.  The Proclamation, which sets out the ethos and principles that underpinned the objectives of the 1916 leaders is as relevant today as it was when it was written.  It guarantees religious and civil liberty and equal rights and equal opportunities to all citizens, and it contains a commitment to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  These words are a solemn pledge to every Irish citizen that she or he can share in the dignity of humankind, as an equal with equal opportunity, and that we can enjoy freedom, educate our children, provide for our families and live together with tolerance and respect for each other.  That should be our starting point, and the process of political reform should be grounded on these core values and be about measures, structures and protocols that empower citizens and create a fully functioning, democratic, transparent, republican system of government that is accountable, citizen centred and rooted in equality, human rights and communal solidarity.  It should also have at its core the imperative of actively seeking to fulfil the constitutional obligation of bringing about the reunification of this island and of its people, as outlined in the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>  Instead of this, however, the Government has decided to opt for cuts and greater centralisation of power.  Instead of creating a more effective, transparent and accountable democracy, the Government wants to abolish the Seanad, cut the number of elected representatives in the D&aacute;il and in local government, and centralise even more power and authority into its hands.  That is not real reform; it is power grabbing.  It may be a very democratic coup but it is a coup nonetheless.  There is more power for government, less accountability and democracy and fewer checks and balances against political abuse and patronage.<\/p><p>  The cuts agenda that dominates this Government's thinking does not bring efficiency, as we have seen from the austerity policies.  Those cuts lead to hardship, inefficiency and more inequality.<\/p><p>  The Constitutional Convention has been considering the reform of aspects of the political system.  However, the Government chose not to include the future of the Seanad in its considerations, despite the commitment in the Labour Party's pre-election manifesto.  This is another broken promise to add to its growing list of broken pledges.  The Constitutional Convention could have played a very constructive role in reforming the political process.  Instead, this has been stymied by the Government, which has significantly restricted the convention's remit.  <\/p><p>  Over the past two weekends, the convention discussed the D&aacute;il electoral system.   I attended last week's deliberations.  The citizen delegates were enthused and focused but limited in what they could discuss.  They could consider only the very narrow agenda of D&aacute;il electoral reform.  Why did the Government not trust the Constitutional Convention to discuss political reform?  Was the Government afraid to allow citizens to have their say on these matters?  Was it afraid they would advocate substantial reform of the Oireachtas, including the Seanad?  It would have made sense to address the issues of how we do our business and govern ourselves and what is wrong from the citizens' perspective with these institutions, and to ventilate all the ideas of reforming the D&aacute;il, Seanad and local government.  Instead, the Government, which promised a democratic revolution and claimed to be committed to the radical reform of an outdated system, has failed yet again.  Its approach to political reform has been piecemeal, minimalist and all about reducing the number of elected representatives.  It has been more about spin than substance.<\/p><p>  In addition to getting rid of 60 Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, the Taoiseach plans to reduce the numbers of councils, councillors and Deputies.  He has cut numbers but brought forward no real, positive, progressive change.  He has done nothing to rebalance power between central and local government, nor has he done anything to rebalance power within the Oireachtas or between the Executive and Legislature.  He risks missing an opportunity to create historic political reform and leaving behind a mess for a future Government to clear up.  <\/p><p>  This State has one of the most centralised systems of government in Europe, based entirely on the British system, and a weak system of local government that has been hollowed out by successive Governments.  This concentrates too much power in the hands of the Executive and the two Houses of the Oireachtas, which are not fit for purpose in 21st century Ireland.<\/p><p>  The flaws evident in the Seanad are reflective of a broader malaise at the heart of our democracy and this institution.  The Seanad has not been reformed because successive Governments refused to reform it.  On 12 successive occasions, reports have been produced proposing reform of the Seanad.  Not one has been implemented.  In 1979, the people voted in a referendum to broaden the franchise to all graduates of institutes of higher education.  This was never implemented.  No Government was prepared to allow further scrutiny of its work.  As a consequence today, we have a Government that is increasingly unaccountable, arrogant and apparently oblivious to the impact of its policies on low-income and middle-income households and disadvantaged and vulnerable citizens.  This is a Government that is abusing its massive majority to force through legislation.<\/p><p>  In the words of the Chief Whip, the Government's record on D&aacute;il reform has been deplorable.  More than half of the Bills introduced to the D&aacute;il since the coalition came into office in March 2011 have been rushed through or guillotined.  Do Members remember the promise that this practice would occur only in the most exceptional circumstances?  Up to mid-March, 52 out of 90 Bills were guillotined.  Rushed legislation will invariably end up with flaws that will be challenged in the courts.  <\/p><p>  The legislation to provide for the family home tax was rushed though the D&aacute;il before Christmas and had to be amended in the new year. <\/p><p>Another pledge, and one of the major planks of the reform programme, was that senior Ministers would make themselves available to deal with Topical Issue debates.  Instead, they have failed to appear in the D&aacute;il three times out of four, on average, to respond to Topical Issues.  In addition, the system of ordering D&aacute;il business is not agreed through a system that is fair, inclusive and transparent for all parties.<\/p><p> The Friday sitting was presented as a means for the D&aacute;il to pass more legislation and to be more efficient.  It has failed on both counts.  There are no votes or questions to Ministers.  It is a farce.  Leaders' Questions, as the Taoiseach has acknowledged, has become a source of huge frustration for Opposition parties.  It serves no real purpose in its current format and is in no way holding the Taoiseach to account.<\/p><p> The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is not inclusive of all the parties in the Oireachtas and its decisions frequently exclude Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  There is no access to media facilities for Opposition parties, unlike Government parties.  If they want to do a press conference, Opposition parties can chose between the plinth or, if the weather is inclement, huddle under the portico.  How is that indicative of an efficient political system at work?<\/p><p> The Government also lauds its decision to allow D&aacute;il committees to question newly appointed chairs of State boards, but these committees have no power to do anything about these appointments. <b><\/b>Sinn F&eacute;in believes a case can be made for a second chamber that is democratic, relevant and fit for purpose, and is part of a wider reform of the political system.  Any reform of the Seanad must be underpinned by clear principles of democracy, accountability and efficiency in its role, and has to be on the basis of the universal franchise and direct election by the people.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in rejects a Seanad whose Members are hand-picked by county councillors, university graduates or nominated by a Taoiseach.  Those who serve in any part of the Oireachtas should be elected by the people.  A radically reformed Seanad should also give a voice to citizens in the North.  It should be a genuinely national institution.  There is currently no provision for the participation of those citizens who live in the North in the political life of the State.<\/p><p> The Seanad should be elected by universal suffrage of the 32 counties of Ireland by citizens over the age of 16.  Citizens in the Six Counties should cast their ballot by postal vote.  The diaspora also should be represented.  It is astonishing that a Government which so regularly looks to the Irish diaspora to help with the economic crisis then denies the very same people the right to have a voice in the Oireachtas. <\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in believes that it is possible to have a Seanad that is an elected forum for civic society, particularly for those sectors not adequately represented in the D&aacute;il and the more marginalised sections of our community.  This is the kind of real reform we should be debating.  Let us look around the Chamber.  It is mostly male, all white and mainly middle aged, Catholic and heterosexual.  A reformed Seanad should address this imbalance.<\/p><p> There is no voice in the D&aacute;il for ethnic minorities, whether they are Irish Travellers or the myriad other ethnic minorities who have come to this country in recent years.  A reformed Seanad could change this.  A reformed, democratically elected and accountable Seanad could serve our democracy well and act as an important counter-balance to the political party dominated D&aacute;il.  <\/p><p> A reformed Seanad could, for example, further scrutinise domestic and, in particular, European legislation.  We have seen in recent years the results of the failure to properly implement or interpret European legislation.  Waterford Crystal workers had to take their fight for pension rights to the European Court of Justice due to the failure of the system here to properly implement the insolvency directive.  The sugar beet industry was decimated by the closure of the Carlow and Mallow sugar plants which, it later emerged, should never have been closed.  A second chamber, elected in a different manner, and with a less constituency focused membership, would be better placed than the D&aacute;il to discuss technical and complex policy issues at length, perhaps along the lines of the hearings on the X case.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach has spoken about comparisons with other EU states which function with a single chamber.  In EU states with unicameral or single chamber systems there are much stronger systems of local government.  There is also a very clear separation of the executive from the legislature and sufficient checks and balances within the system to hold the executive to account.  This is clearly not the case in this State and the Government seems to have set its face against any real rebalancing of power between local and central government or between the Legislature and the Executive.<\/p><p> When I heard the Taoiseach recently criticise the Seanad for failing to hold the excesses of the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government to account and blaming it for the economic crash, I was amazed.  The reality is that the Taoiseach and his party were as much a cheerleader for the Celtic tiger and its excesses and lack of regulation as the Fianna F&aacute;il politicians who ran the State into the ground.<\/p><p> Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna F&aacute;il were part of a cosy consensus in this State for decades.  It was Sinn F&eacute;in who argued during those years for the wealth of the Celtic tiger to be redistributed and invested in public services, infrastructure and sustainable jobs.  It is the establishment parties which failed to act as a brake on the Celtic tiger and to ensure that the economy was properly managed and invested, and the corrupt activities of the golden circles confronted and exposed.  That continues under the Taoiseach's watch.  The cosy consensus is still there.<\/p><p> To point the finger at the Seanad for the mess that all the other parties made of the situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.  They collectively failed to legislate for the banks, developers and speculators, and when it all went disastrously wrong they still could not hold them accountable but chose to make ordinary citizens pay for the greed of the golden circles.  The Taoiseach now seems intent on proceeding with a decision taken on a whim at a Fine Gael annual dinner, without proper discussion, analysis or scrutiny.<\/p><p> Citizens should not be rushed into further curtailing the Oireachtas without looking at the consequences or without any serious consideration of the alternatives.  A referendum should not be limited to abolition or retention.  Why does the Taoiseach not give citizens the option of voting for root branch and reform?  Would that not be the decent and democratic thing, and part of what he promised in the election?<\/p><p> One of the reasons offered for the abolition of the Seanad is its cost.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently argued for the need to reduce high salaries in the public sector, including for politicians, Ministers and their special advisers.  If the Government wants to reduce costs in the Oireachtas it should cut the salaries of Ministers, Deputies and Senators, reduce allowances, cut the salaries of special advisers and stop breaching its pay caps.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach proposes to reduce two dysfunctional Chambers to one dysfunctional Chamber without giving the people the option of voting for an alternative.  Successive Governments had the opportunity to reform the system and all failed to do so.  The Government is now papering over the cracks and presenting this abolition Bill as reform.  It is not.<\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a reasonable proposal that the Constitutional Convention should look at reform of the Oireachtas.  There is still the potential to do so.  It could properly tease out all these issues with the aim of achieving the best checks and balances and the most democratic outcome for our system of government.  Why rush things?  Why not give people a number of choices and put in place a reform package which is meaningful, sustainable, democratic and effective?  Sinn F&eacute;in would support the Government in such an approach.  We will not support this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300036#JJ00200","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371135900,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with Deputies Stephen Donnelly, Joan Collins and Catherine Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300038#LL00100","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1371135900,"counter":614,"content":"<p>That is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300038#LL00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1371135900,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;that&quot; and substitute &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann declines to give the Bill a second reading on the basis that it seeks to abolish Seanad &Eacute;ireann without affording the opportunity to reform Seanad &Eacute;ireann as set out in the Seanad (No. 2) Bill 2013&quot;.<\/blockquote>I am determined that the issue of Seanad reform should be put on the agenda this evening, because the proposed constitutional amendment does not allow for it.  As well as putting forward this amendment, I have put on the Order Paper of this House the Bill brought forward in Seanad &Eacute;ireann by Senators Katherine Zappone and Feargal Quinn and passed on Second Stage in that House.  I do not agree with everything in the Bill, but I agree with the thrust of it and with the attempt to give the people an alternative to either abolition or retention of the Seanad in its current form.<\/p><p>  It seems the Government has not thought through the consequences of a defeat of this referendum proposal.  If it is defeated and reform is not considered, then we will simply go back to the old rotten system which everybody agrees, in both Houses, needs reforming.  Will the Taoiseach indicate his plan B in the event the referendum is defeated?  Are all the rightful criticisms he has levelled at the Seanad to be ignored and indulged?  Will we have the same rotten system we have always had - the 1937 vocational system, as the Taoiseach calls it - which is discredited at this stage?<\/p><p>  I was a Member of the Seanad for nearly 30 years.  The first thing I did when I entered the House in 1981 was to put down a motion, much against the wishes of certain very powerful and rather manipulative civil servants, calling for its reform in very much the same terms as I am calling for it today.  I made my proposal on the grounds that the method of election, the systems and procedures and the composition of the Seanad were unsuitable for the modern day of 1981.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on his courage in confronting the vested interests in his own party by way of his undertaking to abolish the insiders' club which has dominated the Seanad for so long.  He took that on - perhaps not with a great deal of thought, but he took it on all the same -  and he is now finding it very difficult to push the proposal through his own party.  Most of the opposition to the proposal has come from vested interests.<\/p><p>  My view of the Seanad is that it is rotten and full of insiders.  I agree too with all of those who say the university seats are elitist.  The main problem, however, is that it is and has been for many years a home for patronage for all political parties and political leaders.  I include the Taoiseach in that because some, though not all, of his nominees were his own people.  The vast majority of Senators - 43 - are elected by insiders.  It is absurd that it is county councillors, outgoing Oireachtas Members and incoming Members who elect this self-perpetuating body of installed insiders.  That is why it has become a home for both failed and aspiring Deputies and a poor reflection of this House.<\/p><p>  One of the most extraordinary things I found when I was in the Seanad was that the party Senators - I do not seek to exclude university Senators from criticism in making this point - consistently referred in their contributions to their constituencies.  There were constant references to &quot;In my constituency...&quot;.  What they meant, of course, was their geographical constituency, the place they were aiming for or from which they came.  In reality, Senators do not have constituencies.  In fact, their constituencies are the county councils.  These Senators were giving away the fact that they were there for one reason alone, to get into the D&aacute;il.  That was their only ambition and their performance reflected it.  Incidentally, all Senators received some 1,500 envelopes per month, even though most of them required only some 60 votes to get elected.  Yet they received 15,000 envelopes per year for an electorate of 1,000.  What was going on here was an attempt to get elected to the D&aacute;il.  That was how it worked and it was a rotten system.  That patronage will continue if this referendum is defeated and the Government has no plan B.<\/p><p>  What I propose is that the ingredients of the Bill produced by Senators Zappone and Quinn be adopted as the basis of reform of the Seanad.  Universal suffrage must be the basis, with everybody having a vote to elect the Members of a reformed House which would not, however, be simply a reflection of the D&aacute;il in terms of geography and constituencies.  We could have a system whereby Members are nominated by other bodies with an expertise in certain areas and who are elected by the people.  It absolutely must be the case, if the bicameral structure is retained, that elections to both Houses take place on the same day.  That would prevent individuals from standing for the D&aacute;il, as candidates can do under the current system, and, where they are unsuccessful, approaching their party leader about standing for the Seanad or asking the Taoiseach to appoint them to that House.<\/p><p>  I say to the Taoiseach, in the presence, in the Gallery, of two Senators nominated by him and who are nobly defying him on this issue by arguing for reform rather than abolition, that he is to be congratulated on some of his nominees.  The fact remains, however, that the system of Taoiseach's nominees, which gives the Government the in-built majority it requires in the Upper House, is unacceptable.  The temptation - and in many cases the practice - is to install party hacks.  That temptation will continue to be yielded to unless reform is introduced.<\/p><p>  There is a solution to these problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300038#LL00300","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1371135900,"counter":616,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up if he wishes to allow his colleagues an opportunity to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300038#LL00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1371135900,"counter":617,"content":"<p>I will set out the solution on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300038#LL00500","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1371135900,"counter":618,"content":"<p>The Bill before the House, and the question that will be put to the Irish people, is whether or not to abolish the Seanad.  That is a false choice.  I have yet to meet anybody who believes the Upper House should be kept in its current form.  As a new Deputy I was shocked to discover how Senators are elected, and dismayed at the functioning of the Upper House.  If the referendum is defeated, and I hope it is, then I will be strongly advocating for the total reform of the Seanad.  I am proud to co-sponsor a Bill which aims to do exactly that.<\/p><p>  The real question before this House is whether to abolish the Seanad or reform it completely.  There are sensible arguments on both sides of that question.  It is true that some effective democracies have only one House, but it is also true that other effective democracies have two.  What is absolutely clear, however, is that those democracies with one House have an effective House and an effective system of local government.  It is here, unfortunately, that the Government's proposal fails.  We are asking the Irish people to abolish the Seanad before we reform either the D&aacute;il or the local government system.  The Upper House is deeply flawed but it is one safeguard against a broken D&aacute;il and a broken framework of local government.  It is useful to imagine oneself sitting on a leaky boat and the person in charge proposing that he is going to fix all the holes in the boat and passengers should therefore throw their life jackets overboard because they will no longer need them.  One would be an idiot to take off one's life jacket  The correct response would be to propose that the boat be fixed in the first instance and only then should there be a conversation about whether or not life jackets will be required in future.<\/p><p>  In considering the future of the Seanad there are two questions we must ask.  First, do we abolish it before reforming this House?  Second, if we reform this House and the system of local government, is there or is there not then a meaningful and proper role for an Upper House in this country?  The answer to the first question seems unambiguously clear to me.  We should not even consider abolishing the Seanad until we have fixed the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>The Government has pinpointed at least two areas for D&aacute;il reform: strengthening powers of key committees and establishing sectoral committees to scrutinise the work of Departments.  Both reforms are much needed and I would welcome both.  If that is the right thing to do, let us do it, whether or not we abolish the Upper House.  While we are at it, let us reform the Whip system.  The Government backbenches are full of bright, passionate Deputies who want to use their expertise but cannot because they are not allowed to say what they think when they disagree.<\/p><p> The Government must stop hiding behind the guillotine.  I looked up some information before making this speech and here is what I found: from the start of this Oireachtas to March of this year, 52 out of 90 Bills have been guillotined.  That is nearly 60% of Bills.  Sensitive Bills such as the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill, the Finance Bill and the emergency financial measures Bills are guillotined.<\/p><p> The Government should let the Technical Group speak on the Order of Business.  For sure, it is a diverse group and it comes in for criticism, but it is the second biggest group in opposition and changing Standing Orders with two words would allow it comment on the proposed Order of Business in the D&aacute;il.  That has been consistently refused for a long time.<\/p><p> Let us get rid of the ridiculous rule that means that no Deputy on any side of the House is allowed to propose an amendment to legislation that incurs a charge on the State.  It is antiquated and ridiculous.  Let us get rid of it.  We can make these changes and more.  We can make this House do what it is meant to do and what it is constitutionally obliged to do, which is to hold the Cabinet to account.  I do not think any of us on any side would suggest that this House as it stands fulfils its constitutional role.<\/p><p> The Government has correctly pointed out that many small countries have unicameral systems.  Five of the top ten democracies in <i>The Economist<\/i>'s<i><\/i>democratic index are unicameral but many of these systems boast safeguards and rules that the Irish system does not.  In Denmark two fifths of members of parliament may petition the speaker of the house to delay the final stage of a Bill by 12 weeks.  That is very useful.  In Sweden all legislation is considered by committee before it goes to parliament.  Finnish municipalities control health care, education and infrastructure and levy two thirds of all tax.  Article 29 of the Finnish constitution is very interesting.  It states: &quot;A Representative is obliged to follow justice and truth in his or her office.  He or she shall abide by the Constitution and no other orders are binding on him or her.&quot;  No other orders - that would cause havoc in our Whip system.<\/p><p> The Government position is clear: &quot;Trust us, abolish the Seanad and we will fix the D&aacute;il&quot;.  Unfortunately, there is no greater proof of the problem in that demand than this Bill and the way it is being brought in.  There was no consultation in the House.  No analysis was provided and there was no pre-legislative input by a committee.  Surely if this was a signal of a new way for us to work, we should have done it with this Bill?<\/p><p> If the Government wants to discuss abolition versus reform of the Seanad, there are many valid opinions on that around this House and in the Seanad.  I ask it to please reform the D&aacute;il first, to make this House work.  The Seanad has nothing to do with that.  Reform local government first.  The Seanad has nothing to do with that.   Until we fix the holes in the boat, let us leave the life jacket on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300038#LL00600","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371136500,"counter":620,"content":"<p>I believe the Seanad should be abolished but I also believe that the debate around it is going to be a distraction from the budget, which is due in October.  We should not be having this debate.  The Government has promised reform in four key areas: the Constitution, the abolition of the Seanad, the D&aacute;il and local authorities.<\/p><p>  Reform of the Constitution to update it and make it relevant to the 21st century is supposed to be initiated through the Constitutional Convention.  This is made up of 66 citizens selected at random across different age groups, genders, etc., and 33 politicians put forward by political parties, including parties in the North.  It discusses issues that may require constitutional change.  These issues are decided by the Government.  It is not allowed to discuss the Seanad or the X case legislation.  It then votes on the issues and makes a recommendation to the D&aacute;il.  If the Government wants to legislate on that basis it will; if it does not, it will not.  That is not a reforming Constitutional Convention.  To date it has discussed the issues of same-sex marriage and more women in politics, with a majority in support of both.  It also reviewed the voting system in general elections and a large majority favoured keeping the present system.  The convention is a talking shop.  That is not a reflection on the people there but on the way it is set up.  I call for a genuine, elected people's convention to sit for a definite period of time to draw up a new Constitution which is much shorter and simpler than the present one, emphasising the rights of the citizen as opposed to those of the State and the Catholic bishops and those relating to property rights, which are entwined in the present Constitution.  The citizens should be able to review the Constitution which has been in place for most of the past century.<\/p><p>  Abolition of the Seanad was included in the programme for Government and there was no big row about it then.  The row is now predictable.  The Seanad has always been a grazing ground for has-been Deputies, a platform for wannabe Deputies and an elite elected by an elite.  It is completely irrelevant.  People have no interest in it whatsoever.  It has no impact on the ordinary citizen and it is a waste of money.  It has existed for 75 years without anybody who lives in the real world taking any more than the slightest bit of notice of it.  The campaign to save the Seanad is completely opportunistic.  We have talked about reforming it for decades and it has never been reformed.  Now all of a sudden when we are discussing its abolition we are talking about reform at the same time.  Deputy Ross said he tabled a Bill for reform of the Seanad.  That was probably one of the few such Bills introduced.  A former Deputy, one Michael McDowell, is attempting to use the issue to relaunch his political career and test the waters for a new party.  In 1992, in his election material, he clearly identified the position of the Progressive Democrats Party on the programme for constitutional reform, the first demand in which was the abolition of the Seanad.  The same person is now defending the Seanad and saying we must reform it.  Some people ought to think about where they are coming from and going to, and others should be aware of this.<\/p><p>  The proposal to reform local government justifies this debate because we would not be discussing that if we were not discussing the abolition of the Seanad.  We should think about what we need to replace the Seanad.  This will focus people's minds on the role of this institution and on local authority reform under the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  Local authority reform has amounted to a cull of councillors and a further reduction of local democracy.  I am for the fullest level of democracy at local level.  The more local and close to the ground it is, the more democratic it is.  Could we implement the Latin American model of proper participatory politics here?  This would give more power to citizens to decide what communities need in the way of health services, transport and education services, etc.  That is what this country needs, not a top-heavy institution that bases itself on a smoke and daggers approach, with the members calling themselves legislators when really they are focused on using that position to get re-elected.  The cronyism has not changed.  I cannot believe it is still the case that a hospital consultant can tell a citizen to go to his or her local Deputy to get an appointment to have surgery.<\/p><p>That is outrageous and not the reason we are here.  We are here to introduce progressive legislation.  Political parties put forward policies to the people during an election to get into power.  However, those elected to government can change these policies which, in turn, puts pressure on backbenchers who stood on a platform for change.  The Government has already broken its promises on D&aacute;il reform, as it has on a range of other issues.  It has guillotined the debates on up to 64% of Bills it has introduced.  In saying this the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government guillotined the debate on 74% of all legislation it introduced; therefore, Fianna F&aacute;il cannot criticise the Government.  The most outrageous examples of the use of the guillotine were the local property tax, the wind-up of the IBRC, the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, and the promissory notes, as well as the ramming through of recent cuts to public sector pay.  Friday D&aacute;il sittings are a sham as we cannot vote on the legislation on the day.  This, in turn, allows Deputies to go back to their constituencies for the weekend to lay the basis for re-election.<\/p><p> The right to recall an election is important.  If an individual or a party stands for election on certain policies but does a complete U-turn when elected, one should have the right to recall the election.  While I accept the proportional representation system makes it difficult to have a recall facility, some mechanism must be put in place, whereby 25% to 30% of the people can recall an election in which a candidate was fraudulently elected on policy issues.<\/p><p> The fact that the Government will not concede on one Standing Order to allow a group that represents 29% of Members to come in on Standing Orders is a joke.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300039#MM00200","speaker":"1032","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371137100,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Not only is political and institutional reform needed, it is expected by the citizens of the State.  We need to ask ourselves what kind of institutions a modern state requires and what checks and balances are needed to ensure these institutions act in the interests of the citizens of a democratic republic.  What is it about our political institutions that is broken and how we can redesign them in a way that captures what is best about us as a people?  How is it that we have great local and national movements in practically every walk of life, yet our political institutions can at best be described as mediocre?  One explanation could be that we have no real cultural memory of institution building.  We can point, however, to pre-Norman times and a set of laws designed by our ancestors that were highly regarded because they were of the culture rather than inherited which dictate the kind of institutions we have.<\/p><p>  We know the State is highly centralised, but we can fix this by decentralising power to a radically reformed local government system and by separating the Executive from the Legislature, as is the case in countries such as Norway and France.  Clientelism flourishes because citizens cannot easily navigate the various State institutions to access their entitlements.  This fosters a type of middleman or woman political system in which the focus is all about fixing the individual citizen's problem, not about fixing the system.  A political culture in which the focus is all about fixing the system would lead to a clash of ideas where real choices would emerge and politics would become more policy rather than personality driven.<\/p><p>  What we have seen to date in political and institutional reform has been either superficial or primarily a cost-cutting exercise.  While I have long held the view that a country of this size should have a unicameral system, if this debate is just about saving or not saving the Seanad or what it costs to run it, we will have missed a unique opportunity not just to debate reform but also to secure guarantees of reform and see them happen quickly.<\/p><p>  If we analyse the Seanad, 43 of the 60 Senators are elected by public representatives at local and national level.  It is a process wholly owned and controlled by the larger political parties.  Independents and others were elected to 16% of the county and city council seats in 2009, while securing 17% of the first preference votes in the 2011 general election.  However, not one Independent Senator emerged.  Seanad elections are all about horse trading behind the scenes by the political parties.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge that many of the Taoiseach's nominees on this occasion were imaginative and certainly added some diversity which was part of the original idea behind the second Chamber, but that has not always been the case.  The six university Senators are elected by a limited number of institutions.  This could have been expanded in the past couple of decades.  However, the panels are still elected by a sizeable electorate and have been the panels most often referred to in terms of the Senators who have made a significant impact.<\/p><p>  It would be wrong to say the Seanad is meaningless or that it could not be reformed.  In the overall scheme of institutional reform, the reform should occur elsewhere.  We need a functioning D&aacute;il, with a functioning committee system.  We need to decentralise power and trust our communities to make decisions for themselves.  As public representatives, we all have unique insights into how our communities function, with impressive stories about the get up and go attitude that is visible in organisations such as the Tidy Towns, sports organisations, caring organisations and associations, all usually run on a shoestring, with a significant voluntary input.  The community-led, as opposed to market-led, model in which place shaping is the primary purpose of local government should be the foundation of our political institutions.  I favour this being delivered through a district council model, with the phasing out of county councils.  Counties, as we know, are not uniquely Irish.  They were formed between the 12th and 17th centuries and designed as a system of control by the Crown.  If anything, that control was further tightened by the new State and is the origin of Ireland being the most centralised state in Europe.<\/p><p>Imagine what would happen if  we freed our communities to run themselves.  We would unleash a unique genius that we all know is there.  In addition to district councils with a place shaping role, we need small regional councils, I would say three at the most, acting as a service delivery tier.  The value of both would deliver a functioning local government system and would take the excessive localism out of our national Parliament.<\/p><p> If I am certain about one thing it is that we cannot have meaningful D&aacute;il reform without local government reform.  Democracy should not merely be about control and retention of power.  Article 40 sets out the rights citizens may enjoy in our republic, including the right to form associations and unions.  There is no specific reference to political parties.  That right to form associations has been limited to one model, the party political model, in our system, and it is unfortunately designed to protect that system.  There is excessive control by political parties and some of that is a misuse of power.  <\/p><p> Reference was made to the dire consequences of losing the Whip.  The person who is elected ceases to be independent because of the Whip system.  Reference was also made to the fact that we are losing vital contributions from both sides of the Houses as a consequence of that.  <\/p><p> There is control of the timetable by the Executive with excessive use of the guillotine.  I checked all the legislation introduced during the term of the previous Government and 74% of it was scheduled for guillotine.  Some 64% of the legislation introduced by this Government to date, right up to this week, was scheduled for guillotine.  Ironically, this item of legislation that is supposed to reform our institutions is scheduled for guillotine. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300040#NN00200","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1371137700,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I must ask the Deputy to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013061300041#OO00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1371137700,"counter":625,"content":"<p>A simple issue of changing D&aacute;il Standing Orders, to which reference has been made, to allow one member of the 16-member Technical Group to input into the Order of Business is being resisted.
