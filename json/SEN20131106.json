Many of us agree such betting should be brought into the tax net to provide a level playing pitch, particularly for Irish high street bookmakers.  I was expecting something in the budget but that did not materialise.  The Leader has chased this up previously and he is of the same mind as I am.  However, I would appreciate an update on where the issue stands.<\/p><p>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Justice and Equality of his appointment of a barrister to carry out an independent review of the Fr.

Molloy's family.<\/p><p>I have asked on a number of occasions for a debate on policing and the view of the Minister for Justice and Equality on smart policing in Ireland.  Garda&iacute; are operating with one hand tied behind their backs.  They do not have the resources to do their job.  The Minister has announced on a number of occasions that he will open up recruitment for new garda&iacute; but he is yet to set a date.  With new recruits having to attend college in Templemore, it will be two years before they will be ready to go on the beat.  The Garda fleet is being replaced by commercial vans because they can do more mileage with them.  The number of garda&iacute; serving our communities has been drastically reduced in many Garda stations over the past two to three years.  For example, the main station in north county Dublin is Balbriggan which serves 50,000 people.  On 2 November, one Garda car was available for the entire district.  There were four burglaries that evening and an individual was arrested.  The response time to calls that evening was between two and three hours.  That is the type of policing our citizens are getting.  I do not blame garda&iacute; for this because they are not being given support by the Minister or the Government to do their job.<\/p><p>I would like to have a proper considered debate with the Minister in the House on this specific issue.  The position is worsening and he can talk about crime figures all he likes and reductions in certain categories, although many people question their veracity, but garda&iacute; are at breaking point and they need the support of the Government and the Minister.  They are not getting it and, therefore, I ask the Leader to set aside time between now and the Christmas recess to debate policing in Ireland.

It is vital we move forward on this vital civil liberties issue.  I pay tribute to Senators Norris and Zappone who in this House have been hugely instrumental in moving the debate forward.  The introduction of the civil partnership legislation was an important step on the road to the equality, but clearly that alone was not equality.  I am hopeful the referendum will be passed.  I am also glad we have time to prepare the ground for that and that the Minister for Justice and Equality has committed to publishing by Christmas a children and family relationships Bill, which will go a long way to ensuring equality for children, irrespective of the family unit they are in or the marital status of their parents.  That is important ground work that should be done.  It is also important to note the role of the Constitutional Convention and its resounding majority in favour of this referendum.<\/p><p>I call again on the Leader in that context to invite Mr. Tom Arnold, the chairperson of the convention, to speak to us not only about that recommendation but also about the range of recommendations the convention has made, including the most recent recommendation on blasphemy.

He is always helpful and courteous and never flustered.<\/p><p>I also welcome the Government's commitment to same-sex marriage and, in particular, I commend the Taoiseach.  I very much welcome what he had to say because I did not know where he was.  I was not sure whether he was sitting on the fence or was actively hostile to the idea but yesterday he said he would support it strongly.  There could be nothing less ambiguous than that and he said he would be out campaigning for this.  Approximately 80% of the members of the Constitutional Convention voted in favour of a referendum while a large majority of people according to consistent opinion polls think this should be done, and so it should.  Somebody on the wireless said yesterday there were 79 differences between marriage and other partnerships.  There are 179, with some less significant than others.  I pay tribute to the role of Deputy Jerry Buttimer.<\/p><p>When I was involved in this issue a long time ago, it was very much on the margins.  Now it is in the centre and it is terribly important that it is now a mainstream issue, which is taken up not by people like myself but by other people, gay and straight, who have progressive ideas and who understand the pain and difficulty of children, for example, in gay relationships.<\/p> <p> With regard to the role of the bishops, they have every right to speak out.  I have no difficulty whatever with that.  I do wish, however, that they would talk a bit of sense sometimes and take a leaf out of Pope Francis's book.  The suggestion that marriage will be devalued is absolute tripe.  Coming from a group of people who are elderly, celibate, have no experience of marriage and presided over a system which was criminally dysfunctional with regard to the abuse of children, women and gay people, they should be more considered in what they say.<\/p><p>In respect of the Iona Institute, I would like somebody to tell me how it is funded, how it was set up and who its members are.  It is a mysterious organisation that is somehow given some kind of credibility.

This was a hugely enlightening experience which allowed us to develop a forensic knowledge of water pollution and the challenges facing the country in terms of producing purified water.  There has been a proposal by Dublin City Council for some time to extract between 350 and 500 million litres of water per day from Lough Derg.  While it sounds like a great idea in theory, in practice it certainly is not.  Lough Derg is one of Ireland's most beautiful lakes, attracting thousands of fishermen, tourists and people who engage in water sports for several months of the year.  In fact, water sports take place on the lake all year round.<\/p><p>Environmental groups argue, quite rightly, that the proposal, if implemented, will have a detrimental effect on the lake.  From my work on the consultation committee I am of the view that it would be in breach of the European water framework directive.  Greece has already been subject to a rebuke from the European Court of Justice for doing something similar with one of its beautiful lakes.  Are we as a Government, and Dublin City Council as an arm of government, going to go down the same route and face being brought before the European Court of Justice and losing?  The proposal is balderdash and should be taken off the agenda without delay.  Will the Leader facilitate a general debate on water services, as already called for by colleagues, which would allow a mature and honest discussion on the future of the water supply to this city?

This is relevant to our ongoing debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  There are serious challenges to contend with, including mass emigration, the collapse of the construction industry and the huge decline in the fishing industry.  It is vital that attention is given to creating sustainable jobs outside the metropolises of Dublin, Cork city and other urban centres.  Sustainable jobs are simply not being created in rural areas; there is no point in claiming otherwise.  I am not rushing the debate, but these issues must be addressed as soon as possible.  Several Members spoke yesterday of how IDA Ireland is focusing on the main centres of population at the expense of rural Ireland.  I concur with that view.  It would be an interesting debate.<\/p><p>I hope Senator David Norris's long campaign on the issue of same-sex marriage is finally coming to a head.  A great deal of work has been done on that issue in the past 20 years and is now coming to fruition.  I am concerned, however, about the impact of the Taoiseach and certain members of his Government on a campaign, given that their success rate in referenda in recent times has been very hit and miss.  As such, I am proposing that Senators Norris and Zappone should be appointed joint directors of elections.  They know what they are talking about, will create a fresh image and side-step the problem of the damage that could be done to this very valid and important proposal through the appointment of a Government director of elections.  Any effort by members of the Government in this regard could see the initiative sink like a lead balloon.  We were all told the Seanad would be abolished, and thank God it was not.

It is a wonderful opportunity for him but it is also a great testament to the people of Connemara and the people of Ireland that somebody who has come from such a humble background and who worked hard in the labour movement has come to that office.

This is about cyberbullying and cybersecurity, but it is also about how to behave on-line.  Much is being done in our schools.  The Minister is doing much in that area to incorporate the issue into the teaching of RSE and SPHE in our schools.  Whether that is a success and what more can and should be done should be part of a debate in this House, in order to keep the issue to the fore at all times.

Their view is that lives will be lost because of the blunt instrument of cutting across the board without what they describe as a proper understanding of the dynamic of hospital services and their functions.  It is of vital importance that we begin to look at this because lives will be lost.  That is not coming from a political hack on this side of the House but from the people who know, namely, the CEOs of the four best known hospitals in our capital city.  I can assure the House that the situation is the same in hospitals in Sligo, Letterkenny and elsewhere throughout the country.<\/p><p>In such a debate, we can also ask the Minister to address the situation regarding the children's hospital, where I am reliably informed off the record that the committee involved has been instructed to spend no more money.

This would not be possible were it not for the cross-party work that took place in the Seanad.

The Minister is to be commended and I hope that the appointment of an eminent senior counsel will be a necessary first step towards a full-scale commission of inquiry into the horrendous circumstances surrounding the death of Father Niall Molloy 28 years ago.  It is gratifying to think that the work we do here in this Seanad can have positive results.  It would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the courageous work of the investigative journalist Gemma O'Doherty, who persevered with this issue when nobody wanted to hear about it.

However, there was a full debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  The Seanad has equal powers in this function to the D&aacute;il.  Why are we handing that power over to the D&aacute;il?  We had a referendum a few weeks ago where we said we would do things differently.  We said we would make changes in the Seanad, yet yesterday we just rubber-stamped the appointment of important officers of State, without any debate.  I am sure the person who gets the job will be an outstanding Ombudsman; he certainly has a good track record.  However, if there is a problem, people will look back and ask why we never debated the issue and appointed the man without any discussion.  That is a dereliction of our duty.<\/p><p>I see a motion on the Order Paper on justice and home affairs.

There is no point saying we are going to scrutinise European legislation when we are putting through significant decisions on changing the law in the form of a three-paragraph motion that is not debated.

There was a very strong message put out that communities throughout the country, from Meath and Cavan, across to Mayo and down to Waterford, are not happy with this project and they are looking for answers from the Government.  They are looking for a reversal of the decision of the Government with regard to Eirgrid and the planning issue.

The second is to determine if any further inquiry is necessary to establish the truth.  This is an earnest and serious effort to determine the truth in this case.  I also commend Senators Whelan and Kelly in this matter, and indeed other Members on all sides of the House, because it has been raised often in the House.

Another issue that arose recently is the steep increase in the charges for car parking there.  I am sure the situation in Charleville is replicated throughout the country.  When I was first elected to the House car parking at the station was free.  Three years ago a charge of &euro;2 per day was introduced.  Last year that was increased to &euro;3 and recently it was increased to &euro;4.  That is a huge increase in a couple of years.  If one is travelling to Dublin for a few days work such as we do in the Seanad - there might be three or four overnight stays - it is an extra &euro;16 on the cost of the train fare.  It will be as expensive as airport parking before long.  CIE should be held accountable for that.  It will be a disincentive to people using the public transport system, which we consider so desirable.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly raised an interesting point about road haulage.  I have some views on that.  It is well known that many of the main hauliers do not use the toll roads because they consider them too expensive.  I am indebted to my colleague, Senator MacSharry, for the information that all toll roads are toll free for November as an incentive.  The one exception is the M4 to Sligo.  That is quite discriminatory as there should be one rule for everybody.<\/p><p>In that context, this country has acquired a great network of motorways in recent years.  It is one of the many great things the last Government did, although people are probably only beginning to realise it now.  However, the one thing that never caught up with the motorways is the mobile telephone signal.  Vodafone, O2 and the other operators must step up to the mark in this regard.  There are huge stretches of the M7 on which one cannot get a mobile telephone signal.  I am referring to a driver with a hands free phone, should anybody have any other ideas about it.  That should be dealt with because the same thing is happening throughout the country.  These companies are making fortunes from their mobile telephone licences, but they are not giving the service people want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600006#E00300","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1383735600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I echo the call made in the House yesterday for a debate on EirGrid and pylons.

Very often there is a tendency to reinvent the wheel.

Independent Members have introduced legislation and had it passed.  We should look at what is happening around the world.  Recently, I looked at what is happening in France.  There is so much happening there that we could learn a great deal from much of it.  My concept is that somewhere in the Oireachtas there should be a small team to look at and examine such things.

If the Catholic Church is to be saved, it will be Pope Francis who will save it.  The church in Ireland seems to have come out full guns blazing to oppose this.  However, Thomas Groome,  an eminent theologian from Boston, has said that in a major move by Pope Francis, he is to ask the people what they think about matters to do with the church.  It seems that the church in Ireland is holier than the pope but it should wait until the pope makes the next move rather than condemning people.  It is not that long ago since mixed marriages between men and women in this country were condemned because it was considered that one of the partners did not have the right religion.  The church frowned on people getting married who did not have the same religion but thankfully that is no longer an issue in most relationships.

I have spoken on this issue before, in particular my concern that the current imbalance of power between suppliers and retailers is unsustainable in the long term and that the family farm structure and primary producers are being squeezed about of the market.  I agree with the joint committee's findings that in many respects primary producers are not getting fair treatment in the food supply chain, nor a fair price for their goods.  I support the call by the IFA that the Government should now confirm that legislation incorporating the committee's regulations is on the way.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, was here recently and he spoke about the Common Agricultural Policy review and reform but I would like to hear from him again on this subject.

I agree with him that there is a need for a major debate on the health sector.  Over the last two months, discussions on health issues have been personalised by the focus on the Minister.  I think there should be a focus on long-term planning and on the real issues.  Even though over &euro;2.5 billion has been cut from the health budget in the last four or five years, we are continuing to provide the same level of service.  In fact, we have increased it.  Over 254,000 additional medical cards have been issued.  We are providing that service to those people.  I accept that a debate is needed.  One of the problems in the health sector is that it has been allowed to develop in an unplanned way in many respects.  I will give a simple example.  There are three transplant units in Dublin.  There is just one such unit in Norway, and it is doing three or four times more work than the three units in Dublin.  We need to sit down and engage in long-term planning, rather than allowing the health sector to continue to develop in a disjointed way.  While I would welcome a debate, I would not like a continuation of the personalised debate that has taken place over the last 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600008#G01900","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1383736800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in wishing Tom McGrath a long, happy and healthy retirement.

All of us, personally and as public representatives, are well aware of the vast impact of the difficult decisions forced upon this Government due to the parlous state of the public finances which we inherited.<\/p> <p>Taxes have been increased, spending has been reduced and public service workers have suffered significant reductions in their pay.  However, these actions were necessary to ensure the very financial survival of this State.  Those decisive actions have enabled the Government to stabilise the deficit and have led to a reduction in the cost of borrowing by the State.<\/p><p>As stated in the programme for Government, there is a clear need for our political system to embrace change and to lead by example and the Government has done that.  Significant reductions have been effected to the pay and allowances of Members of the Oireachtas through a number of measures since 2009, most recently through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013, which came into effect on 1 July of this year.  The Government has imposed a policy of strong pay reduction and restraint since taking office in March 2011 with the pay of all members of the Government voluntarily reduced from its first day in office.  The cumulative effect of the reductions applied is that the net annual salary of the Taoiseach has been reduced by more than 40% in the period since 2009, which is an extraordinarily stark figure.  As Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny earns 40% less in take-home pay than his predecessor.  Moreover, the pay of the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers has been reduced by more than 35% in the same period.<\/p><p>The pay cuts will of course follow through into a reduction in the pensions that will be payable to members of the present Administration in due course.  The system of allowances paid to Members of these Houses was substantially overhauled by the Government in 2011 upon taking office.  The rates of allowances payable to specified positions in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, to chairpersons of Oireachtas committees and to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission members all have been reduced.  In what is another stark figure, the estimated current cost of these allowances is now less than &euro;300,000, compared with a cost in 2008 of &euro;1.436 million, which is a reduction of nearly 80%.  These are some facts that are not often trotted out in the public domain when people are commenting on burden-sharing.  There are some who believe that Members of these Houses have not taken any pain but these figures underscore exactly the case.<\/p><p>The new Oireachtas expense allowance system began on 1 March 2010, replacing 40 years of legislation with a single parliamentary allowance system to cover the parliamentary and representation costs of Deputies, Senators and Ministers.  This major reform was in addition to the reductions imposed on Oireachtas Members' expenses in 2009.  I acknowledge these two significant reforms were made by the predecessor Administration.  However, it was not transparent enough and I changed the system further from 1 January this year.  I reduced the travel and accommodation allowance by an average of 10% with a higher cut of 25% for Dublin Members.  The expenses paid under the public representational allowance are now vouched, which is a reform long overdue, and the limit of such expenses has been reduced by an average of 20%.  The secretarial allowance scheme also was amended to require evidence of all expenditure.  In overall terms, the changes I introduced this year will save a further 11% or &euro;1 million on the overall cost of the expenses system.<\/p><p>This Bill is an important further step in the reform of the supports provided to the parliamentary leaders of qualifying political parties and to those Members of the Oireachtas who are elected as Independents.  The Government is determined to ensure that greater transparency and accountability is associated with political funding.  Irish people shall be able to discern that the money provided is used in an effective and proper fashion.  With this in mind, this Bill also delivers on the Government's commitment to abolish severance payments to certain ministerial and parliamentary offices.  Current and future holders of such offices no longer will receive severance payments at the end of their term of office.<\/p><p>In addition to the measures described above to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness, the Government has been pursuing a wide-ranging reform programme aimed at delivering open, accountable and ethical government underpinned by a transparent, efficient and effective public system to help rebuild trust in government and in the institutions of the State.  Many of the commitments in the area of political reform set out in the programme of Government and in the public service reform plan are now being delivered.  This ambitious programme of reform consists of a number of significant legislative initiatives which, taken together, comprise a suite of openness, transparency, accountability and public governance measures that will strengthen good government across the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600011#K00800","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1383738900,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Chinese Delegation","time":1383738900,"counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600012#L00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1383738900,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Before asking the Minister to resume, I am sure Members of the House wish to join with me in welcoming the Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, CPPCC, Mr. Wu Zhiming, and a delegation from the Shanghai CPPCC.

The extension of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and powers through the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, which was debated extensively in this House and came into effect last October, resulted in the most significant expansion in the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman in the 30 years since the original legislation was put in place.  As for the provision of a detailed legislative framework for parliamentary inquiries, which again was debated at length in this House, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act was enacted in July and commenced on 25 September.  This legislation establishes a comprehensive statutory framework for the Oireachtas to conduct inquiries within the current constitutional framework.  In respect of the regulation of lobbying, the general scheme of the regulation of lobbying Bill 2013 has been submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, which I understand is due to report back to me shortly.  Drafting of the Bill has commenced and the views of the aforementioned committee will feed into this drafting process.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published later this year and enacted before the middle of 2014.  As Members will be aware, extensive reform is under way of the freedom of information, FOI, legislation which provides for Ireland's FOI regime to be restored to the top tier of legal frameworks internationally for facilitating access to official information.  The Bill substantially restores the legislation to its pre-2003 state and further extends FOI to almost all public bodies, as well as consolidating and modernising it to improve the functioning of the Act and to improve the structure of the legislative framework.  The Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and is scheduled for Committee Stage next week.  In tandem with the drafting of the Freedom of Information Bill, work is well advanced in developing a code of practice to support the implementation of FOI.  As for the introduction of legislation protecting whistleblowers, the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, which was published in July 2013, has passed Committee Stage in the Seanad.  The Bill, which proposes to introduce protections for workers in all sectors who are penalised by their employers for having reported wrongdoing in the workplace, meets the highest international standards and will represent a significant addition to Ireland's anti-corruption framework.  Again, it is anticipated that the Bill will be enacted by year-end or early next year.  An overhaul of the ethics legislation is being furthered, which is aimed at supporting and promoting ethical conduct, creating an environment in which ethical and conflict of interests are managed effectively and corrupt and unethical conduct are severely discouraged.  Finally, much work is being done on the strengthening of Civil Service accountability, on which I will report to the Houses in due course.<\/p><p>My Department also is leading on the open government partnership, OGP.  While many Members will not have heard of this partnership, I recommend that they investigate it.  This new partnership serves to complement the existing objectives of the Government and provides an important international complement to national reform efforts.<\/p> <p>The intention is that Ireland will become a full member of the Open Government Partnership, OGP, by April 2014 and membership of the OGP will reaffirm Ireland's commitment to governmental transparency.<\/p><p>The Government embraced reform from the very beginning, thereby demonstrating a strong commitment to facilitate more open, transparent, responsible and responsive public governance.  These are just some of the areas on which it is working to restore faith in the political and administrative branches of the State, while restoring the finances to good health at the same time.<\/p><p>The reforms being undertaken in this legislation fit firmly within these two aims of fiscal efficiency and democratic reform.  The so-called &quot;party leader's allowance&quot; has been around since 1938, when it was introduced to provide funding to Opposition parties in the interests of the democratic process.  Over time and through successive Governments of all party colours, the allowance has evolved to become a significant source of funding and support for parties in this Parliament, as well as those Members of the Oireachtas who were appointed or elected as Independents, in an effort to ensure they are afforded the best opportunity to properly carry out their duties and serve the people.  However, political funding cannot be exempted from the fiscal retrenchment through which the country is going.  With this in mind, this Bill will reduce the rates of the allowance paid to both parliamentary leaders of parties and to Independent Members by a further 10%.  This is the first time in 75 years, that is, since the introduction of the original Act, that this allowance has been reduced.  As every other allowance has been reduced, it was appropriate to address this one as well.  In a full year, this reduction will result in a saving of approximately &euro;840,000.  As I already have stated, the scope of the allowance payable under the existing legislation has grown over time.  What was once an allowance purely for the leaders of Opposition parties, to spend as they saw fit, is now an extensive support provided to parliamentary parties, as well as to Independent Deputies and Senators, for use exclusively in their parliamentary activities and research.  To reflect the evolution of the allowance and following a suggestion by some of the Independent Members of this House in the consultation process during the formulation of the Bill, this legislation renames the allowance as the &quot;parliamentary activities allowance&quot; to better reflect its true purpose and intent.  Incidentally, I thank all Members, of this House in particular, who made substantial submissions to me.  As stated, the name, &quot;parliamentary activities allowance&quot; was a suggestion from four Independent Members who made a common submission to me.<\/p><p>Electoral activities are funded separately.  The Government has already implemented significant reform for political funding through the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012, which was brought through this House by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  That Act will see political parties fully account for their spending and reduces the potential influence of outside funding by the further restriction of corporate donations.  This Bill will build upon the changes to the Electoral Act by improving the transparency and accountability for the money from the public purse received by parties and independents for specifically parliamentary activities.  The last item of primary legislation regarding this allowance was enacted in 2001.  That Act saw the introduction of a limited requirement for leaders of political parties to account for the money spent from the allowance received in a statement of expenditure, to have that statement audited and to submit these documents to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  That commission will also be given more extensive powers to review the use of the allowance and to offer guidance.  By allowing for the publication of guidelines, those in receipt of the allowance will be able to ensure that the money received is spent in an appropriate manner in future.  At that time, these measures were restricted to party leaders and Independent Members were not obliged to account for the funds received.  In the current climate and with the increased scrutiny on all public expenditure, this is no longer acceptable.  This Bill provides that Independent Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann will now be subject to the same reporting requirements that apply to party leaders and significantly enhances the level of accountability for those in receipt of such moneys.<\/p><p>I now propose to go through the provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 of the Bill is based on current provisions and provides for the payment of the allowance to parliamentary leaders of qualifying parties and to qualifying Independent Members.  It sets out the criteria for entitlement to the allowance and provides for a reduction in the current rates.  It clarifies that the amount of an allowance payable to a parliamentary leader of a qualifying party is calculated on a tapering basis, rather than a flat rate basis being applied to the total membership of that party.  The allowance may be used to fund parliamentary activities such as policy formulation, the procurement of technical advice or support services or for research and training.  The main restriction on the use of the allowance is that it cannot be used for, or to recoup, electoral expenses.  The section includes two new provisions.  The first new provision provides that qualifying expenses arising out of parliamentary activities will only be regarded as qualifying expenditure where such expenditure is not otherwise reimbursed or provided for.  The second new provision provides that, in view of the obligations to the Central Fund and for administrative efficiency, where an allowance is due and payable and a period of six month expires without the parliamentary leader or the Member concerned having claimed the allowance or part thereof, the part of the allowance for that period in excess of six months shall no longer be payable.<\/p><p>Section 3 of the Bill inserts eight new sections, namely, sections 10A to 10H, into the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938.  I will deal with section 10B first as it contains the provisions whereby leaders of qualifying parties and Independent Members in receipt of the allowance must provide a statement of expenditure and accompanying auditor's report to the commission, that is, to SIPO.  This section also outlines the procedure where a change in party leadership or the death of a party leader or Independent Member in receipt of the allowance occurs.  Section 10A provides that should a recipient of the allowance fail to provide the required statement of expenditure and auditor's report within the required deadline of 120 days after the end of the financial year to the commission, they will receive no further funding from the allowance until such time as those documents are provided.  The section also provides that should the commission find that the statement of expenditure does not comply with the legislation, the allowance will not be paid to that recipient until such time as the issues underlying that non-compliance have been addressed.<\/p><p>Section 10C provides for the retention of documentation by party leaders and independent members in support of the statement of expenditure provided to the commission.  Section 10D provides powers to the commission to examine and assess the statements of expenditure provided to it and to make inquiries as necessary to do this.  The section also outlines the process by which the commission may report its findings on the statements of expenditure received.  Section 10E allows for the setting of a date when the above provisions will come into effect for Independent Members and for party leaders.  This is in recognition of the fact that the necessary documentation may not have been collected prior to its being required by this legislation and that some advance notice of these requirements therefore is necessary.  Section 10F provides that in the event that a party or Independent Member of the Oireachtas in receipt of the allowance loses their entitlement to the allowance, they must repay any unspent amounts received within 120 days of the end of the financial year.  Section 10G provides that the commission may formulate and issue guidelines on the allowance and the statement of expenditure to be prepared by those in receipt of the allowance.  This provision has been requested by the commission itself for some time, as previously no formal advisory role was given to the commission regarding these allowances. By allowing for the publication of guidelines, those in receipt of the allowance will be able to ensure the money received is spent appropriately and properly.<\/p><p>Section 4 of the Bill amends the existing legislation in order that any general round decreases that apply to the Civil Service also will apply to the rates of the allowance here.  Previously, only general increases could be applied.  This was not due to any design but to the fact that at the time the existing legislation was drafted, it was not envisaged that decreases would be implemented.  Finally, section 5 of the Bill delivers on the commitment made by the Government to abolish severance payments for specified ministerial and parliamentary officeholders.  These officeholders include the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, all Ministers and Ministers of State, the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the Attorney General.  The abolition of these payments will apply to both current and future holders of the offices in question.<\/p> <p>Currently, no person is in receipt of these payments.<\/p><p>The Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Bill 2013 is a short Bill.  The provisions in the Bill are in keeping with the Government's objective to continued stabilisation of the overall cost of the public service and, as part of this objective, provide for the reduction for the first time in the rates of these allowances, and for the abolition of severance payments.  Greater transparency and accountability in the use of expenditure from the allowance will also be achieved, and the money received from the allowance will not only be spent appropriately but will have to be seen to be done so.  At the same time, it sets out an agenda of reform for the future through ensuring the transparent and accountable use of funds provided by the Exchequer to support the democratic process.<\/p><p>I look forward to hearing the views of Members of the House on the Bill and to considering amendments and suggestions put forward by Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600012#L00800","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383740100,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting the Bill.  In particular we believe the changes to severance pay are needed.  There was no reason to have that type of severance pay in the first place.  It is a simple change that requires to be made.  We also recognise that costs must be saved on the party leader's allowance and the funding to political parties.  We accept and will support that but it should be put on the record that this funding is critical to the operation of the democratic system, and everybody accepts that, provided it is spent appropriately.  The way Independent Members had an unvouched system of substantial amounts of money is a scandal.  That was a product of the influence Independent Members had when parties, and my party in particular, could not form an overall majority in the D&aacute;il.  That is where that system appears to have come from but it is about time it came to an end because it enabled Independents to have a slush fund available to them that effectively could be spent on anything, regardless of the rules, as it was an unvouched system.  That must happen.<\/p><p>This Bill will put burdens on political parties but they are no greater than the burdens on any person.  They are probably not as great as the burdens on most people but it will probably have an impact on jobs within certain political parties, and on employment also, and that must be remembered when we are passing this legislation.<\/p><p>The Minister sets out what he says is a huge range of reforms relating to the workings of the Houses of the Oireachtas and opening up society.  I acknowledge that some good things are being done but in terms of the way people see these Houses still operating, the Seanad yesterday nominated an Ombudsman without debate, major European legislation has been passed without debate, and the guillotine is still being imposed on important legislation before the D&aacute;il such as the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.  People remain to be convinced about reform.<\/p><p>We have had major scandals over the years, particularly in regard to retired Ministers receiving pensions while still Members of the Oireachtas.  That was a cross-party affair.  As of 2009, ten Fianna F&aacute;il, eight Fine Gael and a couple of Labour Deputies and Senators were in receipt of ministerial pensions while serving.  Some of those people serve in the Cabinet now, therefore, their conversion to cost-saving is to be welcomed but that is a fact and it was never right.  Somebody like me who came into this House at the end of that period could see that it was illogical, that it did not have the support of the public and that it greatly angered the public because they did not appear to happen in any other job.<\/p><p>At the same time the public recognises that politics and law making has a cost and as my party leader said in a debate on the Seanad referendum, it is important that we spend a reasonable amount of money on law-making.  We spend a huge amount of money on law enforcement through the Garda and the courts system, etc., but some money must be spent on making laws and ensuring we have the best advice possible.  <\/p><p>The party leaders' allowance must be properly audited, spent and accounted for, which has been done for some years, because it was subject to considerable scandal.  We should not forget that, and I am not forgetting it.  It was the subject of tribunal discussions and findings over the years.  That has changed.  Thankfully, the accounting requirements for political parties were brought in some time ago and I am glad to see those extended to Independent Members.  That is a welcome change which I believe the public will support because it is important, particularly for Opposition parties.  We see that now in opposition.  It is much easier when a party is in government because it has a phalanx of civil servants who do not do political work but some of the products of their work can find their way into political parties or in terms of helping parties in government simply by having that support.  However, Opposition parties depend on this funding to be able to take part in the democratic process, do the proper research and employ people who are educated to help as it is required.  The buck stops with us, the Members, however, and we must do the best job we can do, but with help that is paid for by this allowance.<\/p><p>We will support this legislation.  I do not expect we will put down any significant amendments to it but it is important that it goes through the proper Stages of debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600014#N00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1383740100,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to the Chamber to discuss this short but significant Bill.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend Part 3 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938.  In short, the Bill provides for a 10% reduction in the rates of the allowance, with a saving of &euro;840,000, and for changes to improve the effectiveness and transparency of the allowance by providing for improved reporting and auditing provisions that currently apply to parliamentary leaders.  These auditing provisions will also apply to Independent Members in receipt of the allowance.  The Bill also provides for new inspection powers and for new guidelines to be introduced by the Standards in Public Office Commission.<\/p><p>The reduction in the allowance by 10% was first announced in budget 2013 and is a further example of one of the many reforms promised in the programme for Government.  As legislators, we must always strive towards maximum transparency, and this Bill will go some way to ensuring that.  The programme for Government sets out an ambitious programme of reform to deliver fundamental change in democratic and public governance in Ireland.<\/p><p>The public has lost a great deal of faith with the body politic.  Most of the institutions of the State have let it down in some manner over the past 20 years, that is, the church, politicians, the media, etc.  As we emerge from recession, we must look to reform the way we conduct political leadership in this country.  We must strive to restore confidence in a system where there is none.  Members should ask any person on the street about politician's expenses and leaders' allowances and see the kind of response they get.  For now, we must go above and beyond what is necessary to show that efficiency and transparency are foremost in our minds when it comes to political expenses and allowances.  We must not just administer the system in a fair and transparent manner, we must also be seen to be doing so.  <\/p><p>The Bill will provide for the abolition of severance payments to holders of certain ministerial and parliamentary offices upon cessation of office, in accordance with the programme for Government.  That is a promise made before coming into office and now is being implemented.  We must get rid of the golden handshake culture that once defined our political and business elite.  It was often ill-judged, excessive and reflected poorly on those struggling with the worst of the austerity measures.<\/p><p>Some will say that &euro;840,000 is a small saving but how many special needs teachers would it allow us to take on?

The Minister is very welcome to the House to discuss this legislation.  I particularly commend the proposals in regard to severance payments.  It is absurd that the pension levy does not apply to ministerial pensions.  Indeed, it only applies to private pensions, which creates inequality in society.  The Government has raided people's private pensions through the levy, but business people who are in desperate need of cash to keep their business going and feed their family cannot access that locked-up money.  I acknowledge that it is possible to access 30% of the funds in an additional voluntary contribution, AVC, scheme, but it is not enough.  I would like to see the Government being more open and sympathetic to the notion of easier access to pension funds, which has been done with great success in Denmark.  We should not be afraid of releasing cash into the economy on that basis.<\/p><p>  I welcome the reduction of 10% in the so-called party leader's allowance which, according to the Minister, will lead to a substantial saving of some &euro;840,000.  Will he comment on the issue of Electoral Acts funding, which I understand is separate to that?  According to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, political parties received &euro;14 million last year under this funding, of which &euro;4.9 million went to Fine Gael.  Should we not be reviewing these payments if we are serious about saving money?  In addition, it is estimated that the Seanad abolition campaign that was initiated by the Government cost taxpayers some &euro;14 million in total.  I have heard suggestions that the Government campaign itself, which included advertising and a very fancy website, cost &euro;400,000 to &euro;500,000.  The Minister might indicate whether those figures are accurate.  Information on these types of expenditure items should be out in the open so that the tax-paying public can question whether they represent a sensible allocation of money.<\/p><p>  On the issue of parliamentary allowances, the principle of supporting Oireachtas Members to carry out their work, including researching issues, is a good one.  I welcome the increased transparency in this area.  It seems to me there should be some Oireachtas body or think tank which could review international legislation and seek out best practice in this area.  Not all good legislation comes from so-called developed countries.  Many less high-profile countries have brought forward amazing and innovative ideas that are overlooked but which we might do well to adopt in their wake.  As I argued on the Order of Business today, the Oireachtas - not necessarily just this House - should be examining international developments and, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, looking to see whether we can take on board what is best practice elsewhere.  I would like to see an allocation of funding for that purpose.<\/p><p>  The Minister has taken the right steps and is moving us in the right direction.

The message should go out loud and clear to the public that the Taoiseach has had his salary reduced by 40% and the T&aacute;naiste and Ministers have seen a reduction of more than 35%.  We must also highlight the considerable reductions applied to the remuneration of Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  In addition, there has been a 25% reduction in certain allowances for Dublin Members.  That is all splendid but, as I see it, the public does not give a damn.  If we left everything of ours to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, stripped ourselves naked and jumped off the roof, the response would be &quot;So what?&quot;.  These proposals are not going to impress the public.  They are merely intended as a public relations exercise and represent, in effect, a fiddling and farting around with a number of ancillary matters.  Of course it is ridiculous that people should be still working in their job in the D&aacute;il - it is always the D&aacute;il because it is applicable only to Ministers - and also receiving a pension for the job they previously did.  Receiving a pension while at the same time receiving wages for continuing to work in essentially the same capacity is silly and very difficult to justify.<\/p><p>  The Minister and his officials very courteously provided me with a submission I made on this issue.  I began my letter by stating:<blockquote>First of all, can I say that I recognise this is a time when many people in this country are suffering to an extraordinary extent financially and are finding it very difficult to survive.  This means that it may seem insensitive and indeed even immoral for people engaged in the profession of politics, despite having accepted various cuts, pension reductions and negative adjustments in terms of income, to attempt to justify even a reduced income for themselves.<\/blockquote>I am well aware of all that.  However, the public will not be impressed by anything we do in this regard.  As such, I suggest something far more radical, namely, that we abolish all allowances and engage an independent assessor of international reputation to decide what remuneration we should receive.  I do not want to waste my time collecting invoices, taxi receipts and so on.  It adds enormously to what is already a very busy and stressful job.  I am not a part-time Senator, although there are some such.  From my recollection of the debate, the four Taoiseach's appointees who recommended these changes come to mind.  I am not criticising them, but the reality is that they have jobs and alternative sources of income.  Moreover, they were not elected.  It is comparatively easy for them to suggest, as some of them have, that we should work for half pay.  Meanwhile, the suggestions from elsewhere that we should do the job for nothing would lead to an aristocracy of millionaires in this Chamber.  Incidentally, that is one section of the population that seems to be growing.  I do not want that.  I want people in here who, for instance, have been unemployed.<\/p><p>  I also said in my letter that under the party spokesperson system, members of political parties have people who are assigned special responsibilities, usually in one area of policy.  As Independent Members, we have to cover the whole lot, which is a considerable addition in terms of the workload of research and preparation.  However, we in this corner of the House are among the most prolific speakers.  In addition, we have all brought forward legislation, without any assistance from parliamentary draftsmen or others.<\/p><p>  The Minister spoke about how this legislation developed.  I remember very clearly how it developed, namely, by way of another of these public relations exercises whereby we did not take national wage agreement increases.  The Minister for Finance at the time, by sleight of hand, started producing these various allowances that nobody quite understood but which arrived in the form of a cheque and evened things up for us.<\/p> <p>We are linked to the senior civil servants' trade union and they had their allowances absorbed into their core pay.  That is something not dissimilar from what I am saying, which is to abolish all the allowances and then get an independent person to say how much these things cost.  I think things like \"half pay\" are wrong.  People in the army get half pay as a punishment.  I also do not understand why electoral expenses are not allowed, particularly for Independents.  This is huge for us as we have no support for party funds, even though a huge amount of money is made available for parties every year.  These funds are needed for us to keep our job.  With the enormous expansion of the university constituency, which will be provided for by the Government, why should this legitimate expense not be allowed?<\/p><p>From a public relations point of view, if people are not impressed by the Taoiseach taking a 40% cut, they will not be impressed by this, so it is a disaster from a PR point of view.  There are simpler ways of dealing with it.  I will not take the populist route.  It is easier for people who have additional external sources of income, who did not have to pay election expenses so on and who are part-time in this House, to make sacrifices on behalf of the people who are in this House five days a week.  I used to be here six days a week and I was the person who got the Seanad opened on a Saturday, but it was closed because it only I and a few other Independents came in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600015#O01000","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383741300,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House to debate reforming legislation, something she is bringing before us on a regular basis.

If the Government did absolutely nothing at all, then certainly nothing would change and the attitude and public respect would not alter.

I know the Minister has taken much criticism and the Government has been criticised for doing nothing and people have hurled the accusation at me that there has been no change.  In the way that the Minister has laid out the statistics today, it is clear that some change has occurred.  People will always want more, but I believe there are more fundamental changes to come, such as the pending regulation of lobbying Bill, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, the publication of the whistleblowers' legislation, and the reform and enhancement of the Ombudsman legislation.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne referred to the shovelling through, as it were, of the appointment of the new Ombudsman, but the new Ombudsman came before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, of which I am a member, and his appointment was discussed at that committee.

The Minister mentioned an open government forum.  These things often have a habit of becoming almost weighed down as vehicles themselves.  They have great aspirations and then they become weighed down with their own importance.  I wonder if the Minister could come back to us because I would welcome a debate on how Ireland partakes in the open government partnership, which I believe takes place in April 2014, in order that it does not become a talking shop and a pretence.   I do not think the Minister is trying to do that, but it may become that.<\/p><p>  I suspect this Bill may get more attention than some of the others because it is specifically about cutting money.  The public is always saying that politicians' pay and allowances should be cut.  In fairness, I do not blame anybody for saying that.  A level of financial comfort was afforded to the political class that was improper at any time, but especially in a time of difficult and tight accounting.  It is important to say that public representatives should be sufficiently remunerated to ensure there is a level of respect and that they are less likely to be open to bribery and corruption.  We know that in countries where pay for public representatives is very low, it becomes almost a self-fulfilling prophecy that people are open to corruption.  If we want to govern, we must first ensure we put our own house in order.  That is basic common sense and I see this Bill as part of that process of putting our very disordered house into some order.<\/p><p>  I welcome the reduction of allowances to party leaders.  I know those allowances have existed for a long time, but when we see CEOs of hospitals writing to the HSE outlining their concerns about cancer patients and the amount of money we have to spend, and while we cannot put the two issues in the same place, they are a very stark reminder of how very tight the public purse is and how very difficult it is to balance the budget.  People will see that some effort is being made to reduce those allowances.  Putting clear guidelines in place and giving more authority and strength to the Standards in Public Office Commission is very welcome.  I still see something of a charade in respect of SIPO in that no candidate is taken to task during a general election campaign, which means they can spend all the money they like and need only account for it afterwards, by which time they may well be elected.  I know that is not in this Bill, but I have observed it and SIPO is tied by its own constraints.  I imagine its officials will welcome the strengthening of the office in this Bill.<\/p><p>  There has been something of a charade when it comes to politicians' expenses over recent years, and <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i> was to the fore in publicising events in the House of Commons.  We read about people claiming for the cost of manure and cleaning out their moats and so on.  It is interesting to note, however, that the cost of MPs' expenses, including staffing, has risen quite considerably since that scandal.  While everything came out into the public domain and many copies of <i>The Daily Telegraph<\/i> were sold, some things did not change.  This goes to show how incredibly difficult it is to effect change.  Even last week, MPs and Ministers were criticised for claiming expenses on electricity and gas in their second houses while the cost of these utilities was increasing.<\/p> <p>Again, that puts politicians on a kind of separate planet.  We sometimes get tied in with that and it is difficult to separate the two.  I realise it is a different jurisdiction, but the Minister will understand my point.<\/p><p>Finally, there is a bar stool argument to be made for abolishing all State funding for political parties.  It is an attractive one, the equivalent of banning all politics.  However, it is worth pointing out that if the State does not continue to fund political activity, it will become privatised politics left to the whim of large corporations, philanthropic donations or even greyhound racing events to raise funds.  That would be back to having a banana republic, where purveyors of bananas, beef or computer games would fund political parties.  We all remember the Galway tent, the hideous variation we had for funding political activity.  It is not a model I wish to have.  In a way, this legislation and the other legislative measure being introduced will finally nail the Galway tent and state that we absolutely do not want a system in this country in which private corporations are the funders of our political system.  We cannot have that.  Much as people would like to ban all moneys given to political parties, that could only lead down a very slippery path to enlarging the Galway tent and all that went with it.  I certainly do not want that.<\/p><p>I welcome this Bill and commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600016#P01200","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383741900,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Healy Eames.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600017#Q00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1383741900,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I doubt that the public is ready for 226 naked politicians running around.<\/p><p>I wish to mention a few issues in respect of the legislation.  Obviously, we acknowledge that some of these allowances are used for parliamentary related activities but unless there is a fully transparent mechanism to make public all the revenue and expenditure relating to the political parties, there will be some distrust among the public.  There will always be the feeling that politicians have an easy ride in comparison to the majority of citizens in the State.  Young people at present, on foot of the cuts in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, will feel particularly put out on seeing the salaries and allowances of politicians.  That generates disillusionment and disdain for the political system.<\/p><p>We would have liked the legislation to provide for the withdrawal of the committee chairperson allowance.  Participation in committees should be made compulsory and there should be no additional allowance.  It is part of the role of a Deputy and Senator.

We are supposed to be upright and honest and to stand for fiscal efficiency and reform.

The Minister probably knows what I intend to say as we have corresponded about it, along with the other Whip.

People are more inclined to seek them out.  I have had much experience of that, particularly in the recent past since the referendum was held.  Indeed, that can be seen in the number of e-mails and texts we receive.

The non-contentious point I want the Minister to clarify is that the definition of an Independent Senator in the Bill is \"a member of the Seanad... elected... or nominated... at the last preceding general election\" as a member of a particular party.  Unlike the person who is elected in a D&aacute;il election where his or her party affiliation is on the ballot paper, it is very different in the Seanad.  There is a list of the candidates and their nominating bodies or their nominating Oireachtas Members are listed.  I seek clarification on that.<\/p><p>My second request for clarification is about the list of allowable expenses for which party funding can be used.  In the context of expenses, the Bill states &quot;the payment to another person of any salary or honorarium in respect of duties arising from the person's activities in a parliamentary party&quot;.  Could the Minister clarify if it is allowable under that heading that a person could be working for a Minister?  Does that provide for a person to work for a Minister or does that person, who is paid from the public purse, have to work within the confines of a parliamentary party?  Those are my two questions that the Minister might answer.   <\/p><p>I strongly support the comments of Senator Healy Eames.  It is not in any way possible to defend the case that political parties would continue to keep taxpayers' money to which, in my view, they are not entitled.  Once I or any of my colleagues lose the party Whip, we are no longer members of the parliamentary party.  We no longer enjoy or receive any benefit from the list of allowable expenses for which the legislation provides.  It cannot stand up to any scrutiny, moral or legal, that political parties would continue to keep the allowances which were provided in respect of such Senators' membership of a parliamentary party.  During the campaign to abolish the Seanad, it was claimed that the Government would save &euro;10 million, &euro;15 million or &euro;20 million by abolishing it.  At least &euro;500,000, &euro;600,000 or &euro;700,000 of taxpayers' money is still being paid on annual basis to the political parties in respect of the allowance for former members of those parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600018#R00600","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1383742500,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600018#R00700","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1383742500,"counter":210,"content":"<p>How can that be justified?  There is a list of the prescribed expenses and what the money is to be spent on, namely, the general administration of the parliamentary activities, the provision of technical or specialist advice, research and training, policy formulation, consultancy services, polling or public attitude sampling and so on.  The &euro;23,000 or &euro;24,000 of taxpayers' money being allocated via me to the Fine Gael Party should be simply returned to the taxpayer.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Howlin, is the Minister with responsibility for reform and this Bill is part of the Government's proposal for reform.  The Minister described it as being about financial propriety and democratic reform.  He cannot stand over allowing the political parties to keep taxpayers' money to which they are not entitled.  There is a formula for deciding how much each party gets.  It is on the basis of the number of members they have within the parliamentary party, admittedly as elected, but events bring about certain changes.  At best, it is politically immoral that moneys in respect of those of us who are now Independent Members of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad should be paid to a political party.  There is also a constitutional question about this.  Every citizen is entitled to equality under the Constitution.  Why should money being paid by the taxpayer in respect of my membership of the Oireachtas be handed over to a political party, the parliamentary party of which I am no longer a member?  The Minister may not have a chance today to address that quandary.  I know it is the way the law was framed many years ago but we now have to be realistic.  If we are talking about transparency, fairness, accountability, openness and democratic reform as the Minister mentioned, how can anybody justify that money not being returned to the taxpayer?  I will leave it at that.  I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to make that point.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.  It is an issue we will take up on Committee and Report Stages but I ask the Minister to respond to it with common sense and fairness and to make the necessary amendment to provide that taxpayers will have their money returned to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600018#R00800","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1383742500,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As my colleague, Senator Byrne said, we support the Bill in principle but I support what Senator Sheahan said with regard to rural Senators.  If the plan to abolish the Seanad had worked out for the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, we would be all wagging our tails and it would be a case of croppies lie down; we would just have to take our beating and walk away.  Having been in these Houses for almost 19 years and having served in both Houses, I know it is impossible for any Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann who lives outside the Pale to survive without a rural constituency office of some sort, whether it be an office in one's home or an independent office.  In the last Seanad, having lost my D&aacute;il seat, I continued to fulfil my obligation to the public, both within the Seanad populace and in Cork South-West.  The running cost of my office in 2010, the year before the last election, was &euro;23,000.  My accountant advised that having regard to the cost of my rent, rates and electricity and telephone bills, it was not possible for me to continue with it and I had to close it.  I now rent a room occasionally.  I had 14 clinics last weekend around different parts of my constituency but not one cent is allowed for a Member to do that.  Even though I am qualified solicitor I have not taken one penny from my legal office since 2002 when I became a Deputy.  I have a legal office in Bantry which unfortunately is now in negative equity.  I own a share in it but it is not a milking cow.  I am totally dependent on the Seanad for my income.  Someone should grasp this nettle.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges put a case before the Minister about this situation but it was ignored and the view was that the Senators were looking for extra money.   I am not looking for anything extra.<\/p><p>I have a deep passion for the fishing industry, which is in decline.  It is in danger of being wiped out and we face the prospect that the Icelanders, the Spanish and the French will be running the show here.<\/p> <p>I have travelled to Donegal, Ros a' Mh&iacute;l, Wexford and Kerry at my own expense to meet people to see what can be done to help the fishing industry.  We can have it one way or the other.  As Members of the Seanad - I was elected from the Agricultural Panel - we have to travel the length and breadth of Ireland.  If I go up to Donegal for the weekend, and spend two or three days there, surely I should be able to claim for the expense of travelling.  Is that legitimate or not?  I have not done so.  It is proper that we should all vouch for our expenses, but the curtailments that are imposed on Senators under the current expenses regime are quite restrictive.  We can spend all of our money on advertising, but I do not want to advertise.  I want to go from A to B to C to meet people, listen to their problems and bring those issues back for discussion in this Chamber.  It is a ludicrous situation.<\/p><p>It is time for the current Government to wake up and give some meagre allowance to those who want to run offices in their home areas.  Those who are prepared to pay genuine rent, and vouch for and stand over it, should be given fair play and nothing extra.  It is about time for that to be promulgated and said.  I do not mind cutbacks in our salaries and expenses, but I do not think Senators should continue to be treated as second-class citizens.  The people have spoken.  I think they said the Seanad has a purpose here.  If I was living within 20 miles of Dublin - I am not, unfortunately - I would be in here five days a week.  I have a family and I have to go home.  I spend half of my working life in my constituency, but no allowance is given for that.<\/p><p>I heard someone speaking about the Galway tent.  I think that is the greatest load of rubbish.

I do not think it is well known that the Taoiseach takes home 40% less than his predecessor, or that Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle and the Attorney General earn 35% less than their predecessors.  Senator Norris asked me a specific question about Deputies.  Their pay has been reduced by 20%.  Current Senators are paid just under 14% less than their predecessors.  Everybody here has made a significant contribution.  Expenses have also been reduced significantly.  As I outlined, some expenses have been reduced by approximately 80%.  It is important to say all of these things.<\/p><p>I want to highlight the main thrust of this Bill by focusing on three aspects of it.  First, we will reduce all of the so-called &quot;parliamentary allowances&quot; - the Leaders' allowance, as it used to be known, and the allowance to Independent Members for parliamentary activities - by 10%.

We get confused sometimes.  Of course the pension levy only applies to the private sector, but there are other levies that apply to the public sector.  The levy that was introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, applies to all funded pension schemes, public and private.  I remind Senator Quinn that all public service pensions above &euro;12,000 that are in payment have been reduced as a direct result of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts.  That affects every pensioner who has a pension above &euro;12,000.  I am not talking about a reduction in the fund that pays those pensions, but about a reduction being sliced off the actual pension.  That contribution continues to be paid.  In the cases of the highest of those pensions, the reduction greatly exceeds any reduction that may result from the temporary levy on pension pots that was introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>We need to understand.  Bluntly, I am fed up of the notion of dividing the public and private sectors.  For a very long time, certain newspapers engaged in the demonising of the public sector.  I have asked public servants to make a big sacrifice again this year under the Haddington Road agreement.  Virtually everybody has stepped up to the plate by accepting the agreement.  They have not done so happily, but they have done so in the knowledge of the parlous state of the State finances.  There is a hole to fill and they are needed to make a further contribution.  I applaud them.  I know the people who work in my Department.  I know the work they did on the budget, night and day and across weekends.  I know the people who worked on the sale of State assets, for example on the processing of the national lottery licence.  They did exemplary work.  I know the people who worked through weekends on the Haddington Road agreement.  I know people who worked on the EU Presidency where time was not an issue.<\/p> <p>We want to understand that we have a very fine public service that steps up to the plate and should be acknowledged for the work it has done.  I ask people to negotiate a reduction in their own pay.  That is what I asked my team in Haddington Road to do and that should be recognised.<\/p><p>Senator O'Keeffe spoke about the Open Government partnership.  It is something we should learn more about.  It is a relatively new partnership initiated by President Obama at a side event at the UN General Assembly some years ago.  The plenary session met last week in London and I was privileged to attend.  Now that over 60 countries are now signing up, we need a national action plan.  I commissioned Transparency International Ireland to facilitate that because the NGO sector has a particularly important role to play.  I am looking forward to debating these action plans in the future.  At that London forum, I was asked to give the keynote speech on whistleblowing because they regard our legislation as an exemplar.  It is something at which we can look with some sense of pride.  <\/p><p>Senator Reilly spoke about the salaries of politicians.  I have already mentioned that.  She spoke about the chairpersons of committees not being entitled to anything extra.  That is a point of view.  I was brought up in a trade union household and normally, when one gets extra work, there is a recognition of that.  If it was a store foreman or supervisor, one would regard that person as being entitled to a bit more pay than the person who works with them.  <\/p><p>Unfortunately, Senator Healy Eames had to leave but she asked for a response orally and in writing.  I think the writing bit will be on the public record of the House.

Allow me to answer.  A resource is put in.  There is a certain tautology involved in the notion that Senators are not political.  I know that the Labour Party normally puts up one candidate on each panel.  We normally put up two in the case of the Labour panel.  We divide the number of councillors' votes because we expect our councillors to vote for our candidates.  Of course, it is not political.  That is a competitive spot and if we put up a candidate to fly the flag for the party and abide by party decisions and so on, we expect that person to be true to that.  The Labour Party requires every candidate to sign a party pledge that says that the candidate will always comply with the instructions of the national executive of the party and that in the event that they cannot, they will resign their seat.

I do not propose to accept these amendments.<\/p><p>The purpose of the section is to abolish the exemption from PRSI applying to employees and occupational pensioners under 66 years whose only other source of income is unearned.  This unearned income will become liable to PRSI at the rate of 4% but only if the individual has sufficient income to be regarded by the Revenue Commissioners as a chargeable person. <\/p><p>A PRSI charge will not apply to PAYE taxpayers who have small amounts of unearned income that are subject to tax through the PAYE system.  This is generally regarded as amounts not exceeding &euro;3,174.  In addition, people who have reached the State pension age of 66 are not liable to PRSI and therefore will not be affected.<\/p><p>Applying the charge to a higher level of unearned income, as proposed by Senator Mooney, would have the effect of excluding those with substantial levels of savings from the PRSI charge.  For example, if the threshold for the charge was set at &euro;6,000, as has been proposed, this would exclude those with savings of approximately &euro;240,000 from the PRSI charge, assuming a rate of interest on such savings in the region of 2.5%.  Obviously, given the current low interest rates, one is talking about far higher levels of savings.<\/p><p>In addition, as this PRSI charge is being collected by the Revenue Commissioners along with tax and the universal social charge, any change to the threshold at which the charge applies would cause difficulties in the assessment and collection of the charge by Revenue.  As the Senator will appreciate, this is essentially a Revenue measure which we are carrying in the context of the social welfare Bill because PRSI is also a social welfare matter in terms of the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p><p>The exclusion of people with such significant levels of savings from this PRSI charge would significantly reduce the projected additional income to the Social Insurance Fund, which the measure is expected to yield.  This section provides for the second of two measures which were announced by the Minister for Finance in December 2012, to broaden the income tax base on which PRSI is charged.  <\/p><p>Earlier this year, in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, I abolished the PRSI exemption for modified rate PRSI contributors who also have income from a trade or profession.  The Senator will recall that regarding some people with very high incomes from the public service, such as consultants, there was an anomaly in the PRSI taxation base whereby their other income fell outside the PRSI catchment.<\/p><p>The significant shortfall in the Social Insurance Fund, which is being met by the Exchequer, will be above &euro;1 billion this year.  Given the measures we have introduced, and with the numbers of people going back to work, I confidently expect that the hole in the Social Insurance Fund will probably fall to about &euro;700 million next year.  That is important in terms of sustaining pensions for older people.  We must have a broader PRSI base.  The only alternative is to increase the levels of PRSI on people who are already paying PRSI. <\/p> <p>This is a base-broadening measure to include a wider set of income sources than have been included up to now.  As I have mentioned on a previous occasion in the Seanad, one of the priorities is to take steps to put the Social Insurance Fund on a sustainable financial footing.  Yesterday I told Senators that we are spending an extra &euro;190 million in this year's budget on pensions, contributory and non-contributory.  Of the &euro;20 billion spend we discussed, more than &euro;6.5 billion goes on pensions.  The sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund is critical to being able to maintain our rates of retirement pension for older people.  To ensure this measure does not give rise to additional costs to the Social Insurance Fund, this new PRSI charge will apply without giving rise to entitlements to social insurance benefits.  The majority of the individuals affected by this measure qualify separately for social insurance entitlement based on PRSI paid on other sources of income, for example, PRSI paid on income from their employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600021#U00900","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383744600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>Am I right that the current threshold for unearned income is &euro;3,174?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600022#V00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1383744600,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600022#V00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1383744600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Therefore, there is nothing to stop the Government or any future one from reducing it to bring more people into the net, which seems to be the trend that is developing here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600022#V00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1383744600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>The amount of administration needed would probably not justify going below the &euro;3,000 threshold.

The Minister referred to 2.5%, coming up with a figure of &euro;240,000, which coincides with the reckonable unearned income of &euro;6,000.  I have not seen 2.5% anywhere.  I believe the best rate available is approximately 1.8% or 1.9%.  With the withdrawal in recent weeks of ACC Bank and Danske Bank leaving only the two pillar banks and Ulster Bank as a third, I have no doubt that the emerging duopoly will further reduce interest rates and make it even less attractive for savers.

I want to speak about PRSI on rental income.  The Bill as drafted would require people to pay PRSI on income and not profit.  While capital expenditure, mortgage interest, etc. can be deducted for income tax purposes before paying the income tax aspect of it, I understand the PRSI will need to be paid on income.<\/p> <p>Let us not forget that the vast majority of landlords in Ireland have only one property.  In 2011, some 135,000 landlords had only one property, compared with just over 1,500 who had more than ten.  In the current environment many of those are young couples who separately bought properties during the boom and have since got married, but cannot live in either apartment.  They are therefore renting out a family home from somebody else and paying rent on it while getting rental income from their two separate apartments.<\/p><p>These are people who were forced into becoming, what is often termed, &quot;accidental landlords&quot;.  They certainly never intended to be landlords but have no other choice.  Many of those people are losing a fortune on their properties.  They cannot afford to sell them because the negative equity is so significant and yet the rent coming in is far less than the mortgage repayments.  These people are making a loss on a rental property but are doing their best to hold on to it and just tread water.  Now they will be required to pay PRSI on that loss.  Nobody can dispute the tax to be paid on a profit, but it is scandalous to have to pay tax on a loss particularly for people bringing in very small amounts of income.  Multinationals can write off all kinds of stuff in different tax years.  They are not even required to write it off in the same tax year; they can write it off in other tax years.  How can the Government turn around to couples who are struggling with one rental property and tell them it wants to add to that burden in addition to property taxes and everything else they are now paying on that home by expecting them to pay tax on a loss?<\/p><p>I believe it is incredibly unjust and I urge the Minister to change that provision.  At the very least the Minister should accept Senator Mooney's amendment whereby the PRSI would only be paid on income over &euro;6,000.  A typical rental property in Dublin would yield &euro;7,000, &euro;8,000 or &euro;10,000, which at least would cover some of the income for them.  As a matter of principle, I object to the provision on the rental income side.  If it applied to rental profit, it would be fair enough.  Applying it to income is objectionable.  However, before tabling a stronger amendment to change it from income to profit, I want to hear the Minister's response to establish if my understanding is correct.  Unlike the income tax provisions which justifiably allow for deductibles, the provision as drafted does not and will apply to all income regardless of whether the person is making a loss after paying mortgage repayments, letting fees, the PRTB fee and general maintenance costs.  Ultimately they will be taxed on that loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600022#V02100","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383745200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>This is one of the few sections we support and we will oppose the Fianna F&aacute;il amendments for good reason.

The benefits have been shown by the OECD and the recent actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund by KPMG.  This was not work by the Department of Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners but was independently done.  Given the benefits they acquire, which are broadly maternity benefit, widow's, survivor's and retirement pensions, the 4% contribution by self-employed people represents some of the best value that the social insurance system offers to any contributor.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney spoke about people who were formerly self-employed who may even have employed other people and paid employer PRSI contributions.  The advisory group, chaired by the barrister, Ms Ita Mangan, did considerable research on this.  What we found will be backed up by what many Senators, who have dealt with cases on the ground, will know.  The advisory group report found that approximately 85% of the 20,000 self-employed people, who claimed the means-tested jobseeker's allowance during the worst three-year period of the crash following the bank guarantee in 2008 from the beginning of 2009 to 2011, actually got jobseeker's allowance.  In other words, even though the self-employed do not pay a contribution of 14.75%, which employed people pay - 4% employee contribution and 10.75% employer's contribution - since I became Minister we have allowed self-employed persons or indeed farmers who have had a catastrophic fall in income to prepare accounts of their current financial position whereas with the previous Government they relied on previous years' accounts.<\/p><p>The crash really began in 2008 and accelerated particularly during 2009 and 2010.  Many people in those days looking for some social welfare support did not qualify for jobseeker's allowance.  Senators will recall the sad stories of such people who were broke having to go and get accountants to redo accounts.  We have changed that, including for farmers which was important in the context of the farming crisis experienced earlier this year and at the end of last year, to allow people to bring in current financial information.  We do not require them to go off and get expensive accountants.  They can go to their local social welfare office and bring their details there.  The situation Senator Mooney has described no longer applies and we have the figures from the advisory committee showing that 85% of the 20,000 formerly self-employed people got jobseeker's allowance.<\/p><p>Why would a person not qualify?  It might be because his or her spouse was in employment or had another occupation or business with income above the means-test limits.  However, that particular situation was one of the terrible features we discussed with people during the 2011 general election campaign.  I remember visiting Letterkenny and talking to people who had worked in construction and may have employed a few people.  Some of them lived in big houses which needed to be heated and they were trying to pay the mortgage even though everything had crashed around them.  I was very influenced by that and when I became Minister I was determined to make the change to allow them to be assessed on a current account basis, which is in effect as we speak.<\/p> <p>Therefore, if I were to ask Senators, they would agree that they do not hear the level of distress experienced by people in those situations who try to get social welfare support.  As I said, in some cases their spouses might have significant other means.<\/p><p>I shall return to another question on principles.  The Revenue Commissioners administer a scheme that exempts the first &euro;3,174 of income.  People may say, in the context of interest, that the provision is not terribly significant.  However, it is an important allowance.  For instance, a person who earns an income from their employment, trade or profession pays PRSI on the gross amount.  Why should somebody with an income from other sources, and in this case it is interest, be put in a more favourable position than somebody at work who pays PRSI on his or her gross income?<\/p><p>Yesterday, I listened very carefully to the Second Stage speeches and Senators emphasised repeatedly the importance of retirement pensions and those of widows and widowers.  If we are to fund these, we must have a fund of money, and in Ireland that is the social Social Insurance Fund.  It went into catastrophic deficit as a consequence of the crash, which is exactly what Senator Mooney talked about.  We have now got the fund on a path to recovery and stability.  If we grow and maintain the fund over the next period and right up to 2050, we will ensure every retired person in the country has an appropriate retirement pension.  Not only that, it is one of the reasons that I, as a Minister, can tell older people who are retired that I can maintain - and have maintained - the basic weekly rate of retirement pension.<\/p><p>The amendment proposes the expansion of the PRSI base and will maintain the contributory pensions.  I think I said to people yesterday that we must spend an extra &euro;190 million this year due to an additional number of older people qualifying for retirement pensions.  We must absorb that provision in our costs for this year and next year and, therefore, must increase the base.  The amendment allows for a small and moderate increase in the base of the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600023#W00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383745800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>The Minister did not respond to my question on PRSI contributions paid as part of income.

Without that employer those jobs and PRSI income would not exist.  Those employers are entitled to more than just the odd <i>ad misericordiam<\/i> jump at a jobseeker's allowance.

At least that is a tax on interest.  The rental income provision is extraordinary because it is based on a loss.  As I pointed out earlier, there are multinational companies in this county which make billions and yet write off all kinds of things to avoid paying tax.

Broadly, if I can remember my income tax law, there are categories of earnings from employment, trade or a profession where one carries on an activity and income streams arise from the activity.  That is distinguished that from what would have been, in those days, largely income from rents, such as, for example, the income stream that flows from land, which is an asset.  At the time people like Marx were very occupied with the idea as well, and income from capital sums lodged in banks were income streams.  It is simply an old distinction but Senator Norris is possibly correct that the language should be changed.<\/p> <p>It is something we inherited from the time of Joyce, and I am sure he made some references to it in terms of commercial operations in Dublin at the time.<\/p><p>Regarding Senator Power's points, the rates that apply in general to any source of income for taxation purposes also apply to income for the purposes of charging PRSI.  It is the Minister for Finance who broadly deals with the charging of taxation, and the companion charge is PRSI.  The income on which PRSI is applied, therefore, will in general be the same as that for the charging of taxation.  The basis for general taxation, income tax or other forms of taxation that may apply to particular revenue streams is the same as that which applies to PRSI.<\/p><p>The point in our system, in terms of the Social Insurance Fund, is that there were areas of income that did not give rise to PRSI.  In the rental example to which the Senator referred she is talking about a stream of rental income and if the stream of rental income is under &euro;3,174 the PRSI charge would not apply.  For somebody with a rental income - one property and so on as the Senator describes it - ultimately, it may be that over a long period of time and as the economy recovers those losses may be recovered.  As the Senator rightly said, people in other lines of business such as banking have significant carry-forward loss provisions but people involved in renting also can do that in a more constrained way against those sources of income.  However, that is a matter for the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>In terms of social protection, what the Minister for Finance laid out in his budget provisions in December 2012 was to provide for wider streams of income to go into PRSI.  I strongly support that because the Social Insurance Fund, which is the basis of our paying widow's pensions and retirement pensions, this year will be in deficit to the tune of approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  At the height of the crisis that went up to over &euro;2 billion.  If we want to continue paying the existing level of pensions to our pensioners and retired people, never mind increasing those in the future, we must have a replenished, strong Social Insurance Fund.  That is the argument of the Minister for Finance regarding this broadening of the PRSI base.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600024#X01000","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383746400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Can I ask a question-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600025#Y00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1383746400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>If I may respond directly on that point before Senator Mooney asks about another issue, the crucial point is that the income will be subject to tax but the Minister is not providing for disregards from the PRSI liability in the way she does from income tax.

That is the difference.  I agree the income is the same but not having the same disregards as the Minister has for the income tax side, the result is completely different.  That is the reason it needs to be rephrased to ensure the legislation only refers to profits from rental properties.  At the very least the Minister should provide the same disregards.  The legislation should at least state that if the areas that would be discounted from rental income for the purpose of income tax, such as capital expenditure, repairs on a home, 75% of the mortgage interest and so on, logically they should also apply from the PRSI base as well, even using the argument the Minister just made about the need for the two systems - the income tax side and the PRSI side - to work in a similar way.

There are 200,000 small businesses in Ireland employing more than 655,000 people.  It is a key sector of the economy.  Many of these jobs are in the retail and hospitality sectors, where employee costs account for more than 60% of total costs.  These small companies do not have the flexibility to move staff around when one employee is out sick and, as such, this measure will act as a barrier to future employment in those areas.<\/p><p>The Minister has made comparisons with the systems in place in other jurisdictions to support her arguments, but some of those comparisons do not stand up to scrutiny.  In the case of Northern Ireland, for example, while employers do make the initial sick pay payment, this can be offset against their PAYE tax bill at a later date.  In addition, it has less of an immediate cashflow implication as the weekly payment is just &pound;81.60 for 28 weeks, compared with &euro;188 per week for two years in this State.

The first point to make is that we do not have a statutory sick pay scheme in this State, unlike in most other countries.  What we are dealing with here is a crude, cost-cutting measure.  It is true that most workers will not be affected by it - public sector workers will be covered, as will a majority of private sector workers because their employers will pick up the cost.  However, a minority of workers - moreover, a growing minority - will not be covered.  As we know, part-time work, precarious employment, zero-hour contracts, flexible contracts and so on are becoming an increasing feature of employment in this State.  It is these types of workers who will be most affected by the cut in illness benefit entitlement of &euro;112.80 which arises from the extension of the waiting period.  The bottom line is that a significant section of people who have paid their PRSI and the universal social charge will now have less cover.<\/p><p>As Senator Mooney pointed out, the measure will also have an impact on employers, many of whom are struggling to meet the costs of business.  Any additional cost or burden that is imposed on small business employers is a difficulty.  Workers pay PRSI in the expectation that if they get sick they will be able to access illness benefit.  Both employers and employees are paying more PRSI than ever before, in addition to which workers are paying a universal social charge, the purpose of which has never been properly explained.  All people can see, in budget after budget, is fewer social insurance entitlements on the one hand and, on the other, more money being taken out of their wages.<\/p><p>This measure will impose a burden on many families and individuals.  While the figure of &euro;112.80 might seem small to the Minister, it will not be so for low-income individuals, in particular, who find themselves in a position where they are not covered and must take the hit themselves.  Likewise, it is a significant burden for employers who decide to take the hit.

To reiterate the point I made on Second Stage, extending the waiting period from three to six days means that people will have to maintain a float, so to speak, to ensure they have a little protective padding in times of illness.  The problem is that most of the people affected by this change will be in the lowest socioeconomic category and are living on such thin margins that they have the least possibility of being able to maintain that type of safety net.  We heard this morning on the radio and in this House about people being forced to use loan sharks to make up payments of various types.  The idea that somebody who is ill, and having been unable to save up the shortfall in illness benefit, would be forced to seek out a loan shark is very worrying.  People in that situation are being very unjustly hit.<\/p><p>From the employer's point of view, it seems to be a case of the State attempting to transfer its own responsibility onto those who have created employment.  Employers get nothing out of the situation at all because, unless their employees, they do not benefit from PRSI payments.

Given that they make PRSI contributions to the State, they cannot avail of any social welfare transactions when they become unemployed themselves.  There is a question here of going after people in a targeted manner.  Small businesses, which are already struggling out there at the moment, will face additional pressures as a result of this move, but more importantly the employees concerned will have to ensure that they have a float of at least one week's wages saved before they become ill.  That is grossly unreasonable.  The message from this move is that it is okay to become ill, but one must have a week's worth of wages saved before one does so, or else the State will not provide support.  What happens when the employers are not in a financial position to make any form of payment to individuals who are becoming ill or injured?  This is wholly unreasonable and it will affect many people in a very disproportionate way.<\/p><p>While there are instances where people may be able to support themselves or employers could provide the support - the example was given of the public sector or multinationals - the smaller employers will find this measure very painful.  In the event they are not able to fulfil the perceived obligation under the measure, the individual employee will suffer.  That is unreasonable and it is why Senator Mooney is opposing this section.  Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister to take on board what has been said here.  At a time when somebody is either injured or ill and is not able to support himself or herself, the State has an obligation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600027#BB00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1383747600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>This measure was outlined and examined as part of the comprehensive review of expenditure carried out in 2011.  Savings arising from this measure are just over &euro;20 million and they will ease the pressure on the social insurance fund, for which there was a deficit of &euro;2 billion last year.  This year we expect to have it down to &euro;1.5 billion because people are going back to work.  As more people move back into employment next year, we hope the deficit will fall to &euro;700 million.  That is still a huge shortfall, and we are committed to maintaining all of the weekly rates of social welfare payments, which we have managed to do.<\/p><p>This amendment will not affect primary rates of payment, rates of payment for dependents or duration of benefit for illness benefit claims.  No existing customers of illness benefit will be affected by the measure, but from 6 January 2014 people who are coming into the illness benefit scheme will be affected by it.<\/p><p>It should be noted that there will still be continuity of payment for claimants transferring from jobseeker's benefit or allowance to illness benefit under the revised arrangements.  In 2013, the Department will spend &euro;662 million on illness benefit, which is one of the highest rates of payment in all the OECD countries.  Many people will say that those figures are perhaps exceptionally high because of arrangements in the public sector which are currently undergoing changes.  However, we have very high levels of claims in respect of illness benefit.  The cost is &euro;662 million, which is down by &euro;111 million on the 2012 expenditure, partly due to the revised management of sick pay in the public sector, about which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has spoken to Senators.  It is an issue that has come up in many European countries due to its cost, and we wish to concentrate the payments in respect of illness and disability on those who need them the most.<\/p><p>Many employees, including those in the public sector, receive their salaries when out sick where their employers have occupational sick pay arrangements in place.  The employer then recoups the payment from the social insurance fund, so the employees will not suffer any reduction in income as result of the measure.  However, the employer, including public sector employers, will receive less in recoupment from the Department of Social Protection.  Where employees are not covered by an occupational sick pay scheme, and they have an income need to cover the short period until illness benefit becomes available, they may have recourse to supplementary welfare allowances and to special needs payments.  I wish to be clear about that.<\/p><p>There is no link between this measure and a statutory sick pay scheme which almost all European countries have introduced.  There is no additional obligation, as a consequence of this measure, on employers.  There is no element of compulsion on employers to pay employees for the duration of the new waiting day period, where they do not have an occupational sick pay arrangement already in place.  Social insurance is not restricted to cover in respect of illness, as there is a range of other entitlements for people under social insurance.  <\/p><p>This measure will reduce the overall social welfare bill in the Department in respect of illness by over &euro;20 million per year.  Much of that is paid in recouping money for employers, but if employers seek to limit their costs on these waiting days, then the management of initial early number of sick days will be with the employer.  All of the evidence from people involved in management and ownership of businesses, and the experience from other countries, suggests that the closer sick leave is managed to the place of employment, the better the outcomes for the employer and the employee.  One of the problems in social welfare systems is that if people build up fairly continuous sick leave arrangements and gradually begin to leave employment in some cases, the outcome can often be very bad for the individual.  Most occupational medical experts will say that when somebody has an illness and later recovers, the best thing is to get back into the world of work if possible.  That is very significant in assisting recovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600027#BB00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1383748200,"counter":325,"content":"<p>For the record, last year the Minister indicated that she was reducing the statutory redundancy from 70% of two weeks per year to zero or increasing the sick pay leave, as in the Bill now.

The first point I made in my contribution is that we do not have a statutory sick pay scheme.  That presents problems for all workers.  If this section is passed, it will mean that some employees will suffer and lose three days illness benefit and some employers will have to pick up the tab.  I agree with Senators who spoke about this continuous shift of the burden from the State and the social insurance fund to employers.  It is unfair.  I supported the Minister earlier with regard to extending PRSI contributions to unearned, reckonable income.  I have no difficulty with both employees and employers paying their fair share of PRSI.  However, people expect to get a return.  They expect that if they get sick, they will have an entitlement.  They should not have to depend on an employer to pay them.<\/p><p>There is another problem if this is passed.  Many businesses are struggling.  They have contracts with their employees.  How many of them will change the contracts when they come up for renewal or if they are taking on new employees?  How many of them will cover sick pay into the future?  I believe it will probably be fewer.  They might not be able to pay it.  The same happened with the redundancy benefit.  In that case, the worker eventually loses.  The worker would have received their statutory redundancy and because the employer was able reclaim a sizeable portion of that from the State, they were able to give a top-up payment to the worker.  Now the employer cannot do that because they must pay almost the full statutory redundancy.  Ultimately, it is the workers and employees who will lose.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, employment is more precarious.  Mandate trade union produced a report on this quite recently, of which the Minister will be aware.  More people are working part-time, there are more flexible contracts and zero hour contracts are creeping in.  These workers will not have protections.  My biggest fear is that genuine employers who wish to look after their staff and ensure they have good entitlements will be in a more difficult position and will be less inclined to give them cover such as this, because they will simply be unable to pay.  While many of them in good faith paid their employees in the past on the basis that they would get the money back, at least some of them will be unable to do that in the future.  That is my concern.<\/p><p>With respect, the Minister did not address many of the core concerns that were articulated to her.

I wonder if, behind this, there is a feeling that there are malingerers.  There are some  - there are always a certain amount in any situation - but I believe it is a small proportion.  I have heard people say, \"I have five sick days left, so I can go on holiday\".  We certainly must change that attitude, but I do not believe it is widespread.  What has become clear from this argument is the need for a statutory sickness scheme.  The Government should act on that and be as helpful as possible to small business in establishing it.<\/p><p>The Minister is not going to move on this.  She has made as good a case as possible and has been very helpful.  However, when the supplementary welfare fund is dragged out again, I wonder how elastic it is.  How much is in it?  I have heard it produced to refer to a number of other issues, including the burial grant.  One is told people can apply for the special supplementary welfare payment.  That seems to be the mattress on which the Government is relying.  If this is true, there will not be much of a saving.

It was never an issue.  Any employer who has good staff would not consider telling them, \"You will not be paid for three days, so hard luck\".  One does not create that type of relationship in a small business and expect to survive.  We are moving towards the norms that exist in Europe, but from my experience of having staff for 25 to 27 years it does not cross an employer's mind to move on without paying their staff or by having staff out of pocket.  All employers over the years have had staff who were off for various reasons but they have never been legalistic with them and told them they are not getting paid for missing certain days.  An employer will be flexible with their employees.  It also works the other way around.  Many times employees are flexible with their employer, such as agreeing to come in on a Saturday even though they do not have to do so.  It works both ways.<\/p><p>For a business to survive at present, this provision will not make or break it.  What we need is confidence back in business.  I spoke to other small employers in my local area and asked them what difference this provision would make.  They said it would be very little.  They said their job is to get people in the door to sell their products and to get to the end of the month and the end of the year.  It is really about the relationship the employer has with the employee, and 99 out of 100 employers and employees alike will have had good experiences.  Those businesses will not survive if the staff and the employer are not pulling together.  Perhaps it is an issue in a large company, where there is lower, middle and senior management and there are ongoing staff issues.  However, in the small local business that is struggling to survive, this is not a massive issue.  It would be great if the system we have could continue all the time, but we are moving towards what is normal in Europe, as the Minister said.  We cannot afford that luxury.  From my perspective, having been in that sector for a long time, I do not consider this a game changer for any business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600028#CC00400","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1383748200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I am glad Senator Norris raised the supplementary welfare allowance and how it can replace the payment on some occasions for some people.  I was beginning to think nobody on that side of the House had heard what the Minister said.  With regard to Senator Norris's question about the size of the supplementary welfare allowance budget, it is a demand led scheme so the money must be available for it.  It is there to help needy people.  For example, the victims of this new measure might be the bank manager's wife who goes out sick.  I am sure the Senator is not here batting for wealthy people and to ensure that they get their share of it.

Two schemes are commonly mentioned.  One is the supplementary welfare allowance, which Senator Kelly referred to, which is a weekly payment of &euro;2 or so less than the standard &euro;188 per week.  The second one, which we will probably discuss further later, is what is called a special needs payment or exceptional needs payment, ENP, in social welfare parlance.  That is a fund for people who go to a community welfare officer when there is a particular need.  We are spending between &euro;46 million and &euro;50 million per year on that.<\/p> <p>As Senator Kelly said, the supplementary welfare allowance is an elastic amount because it depends on the number of people coming forward who will qualify.  I emphasise to Senators that somebody who has a special need arising from this will qualify to seek a supplementary welfare allowance.<\/p><p>In the context of the work of the Department becoming a public employment service, I had the privilege of having a great deal of contact with employers around the country and on many occasions had an opportunity to discuss issues around illness.  For some types of employment large amounts of employee sick leave is a significant cost, particularly so in parts of the public service.  In this particular case the impact of this measure will be to give the public service type employer a very strong incentive to better manage short-term illnesses of employees.  It is hoped the outcome of that will be less overall illness and also less development of a pattern of people having repeated and significant amounts of short-term illnesses.  From what Members were saying, they are quite familiar with that.  It is important that is managed at the level of the actual job.  It is not possible for the Department of Social Protection to manage that in any detail.  That is for the management of the employer.  This will give an enhanced incentive to employers to manage it.<\/p><p>In terms of all the different illness payments, including disability and invalidity, as a country we are spending approximately &euro;3 billion.  That is about 16% of our payments whereas in Europe the average is about 10% or 11%.  We have a problem in Ireland, therefore, with higher volumes of people on different types of disability benefit.  This is precious money and in terms of social welfare provision we must ensure it is targeted at the people who have very serious illnesses and disabilities and who probably merit more support than they currently get because of the pervasiveness of and the larger number of illness claims here than is the norm in many other countries.  Hence, many other countries have moved under statutory sick pay arrangements, including in the United Kingdom, to make employers responsible for all of the first four months.  In the Netherlands, which once had such a problem when it was described as the sick man of Europe, such responsibility in respect of employers has moved to two years.  We are not doing that.  We are moving to a period of six days and I expect that will make a modest saving - it is about &euro;20 million a year - but I hope it will result in a significant improvement in the management of short-term illnesses in employment.<\/p><p>I was told by IBEC that 75% of its members have statutory sick pay schemes.  To refer to what Senator Harte said, around the country at the different forums which I addressed on getting people back to work, people said repeatedly that in their small firm all the employees know each other, the management know them and where somebody is ill and has to take time off, that is not a problem for the small employer employing a small number of people.  Employees are very anxious to work but there is a problem in some organisations with the way this has evolved.  Currently, it is costing us &euro;661 million.  This measure will achieve a modest but important saving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600028#CC00600","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383748800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>In her helpful explanation of the various supplementary and other schemes, the Minister almost gave an impression that it was a panacea.

For the second year in a row, working mothers have been targeted for huge cuts in maternity benefit.  Last year, the payment was taxed for the first time with the result that many women lost an incredible &euro;2,700 over the course of one maternity leave period of 26 weeks.  In this Bill, the payment is being cut by &euro;32 per week for over 90% of claimants.  Between budget 2013 and budget 2014, new mothers will have been hit for an astonishing &euro;3,500.  These are women who have worked and paid PRSI - it is a PRSI payment - so they have paid their social insurance.  As the Minister pointed out earlier, it is one of the few payments that is available to self-employed women on the self-employed stamp.  These are people who have worked and made their PRSI contributions.  It is an incredibly expensive time in family life.  Having infants is extremely expensive in terms of all the additional costs put on families.  Now they are being hit for &euro;3,500.<\/p><p>It is a savage cut.  The National Women's Council described it as anti-women and anti-family while Barnardos described it as anti-parenting, callous and unsupportive.  It was one of the worst cuts to target young mothers in this budget and the previous one.  Many women simply will not be able to afford to take the full six months of paid maternity leave and will be forced to return to work early, which is bad not only for themselves, but also for their children.  In terms of child care provision, the early years strategy and where we are trying to go in terms of prioritising investment in children at the youngest possible age, the first year is crucial.  Ireland only has six months paid maternity leave when best practice internationally is to pay a year so that women can spend the crucial first year at home with their children.  Not only do we only pay for the six-month period, we will now make it even harder for women to take that period.  <\/p><p>Some women will be hit harder than others.  Public sector employees will not be hit at all because the State will pick up the tab so female civil or public servants at least have some comfort in knowing that they will still get their full maternity pay when they are out on leave.  A total of 75% of large companies pay top ups to ensure their female staff are able to get their full pay while on maternity leave.  The number of companies doing this even among our largest employers has dropped considerably.  Some surveys show it has dropped by 25% since 2008 because companies are cutting back in this area due to other financial pressures.  In respect of women who work in small companies, only one quarter of SMEs pay top-up maternity pay so the majority of women who are in low-income employment or who work for small companies will not get any top ups so they will struggle financially as a result of these cuts.  <\/p><p>It is crazy that this group is singled out in such a savage way by the Government.  The Minister made the point about protecting core rates in all the budget commentary and in our earlier debate today.  That is fine but I do not think there is any group that has not been cut for other ancillary payments at this stage.  How can the Minister say that core payments to women on maternity leave have been protected when they have been cut by &euro;3,500?  It is an incredible cut that is really unfair, which is why we are opposing this section.  I appeal to the Minister to look at it again because it is really savage.  Over 45,000 women will be affected between last year's cut on the taxation side and this year's cut in payment.  It is crazy to cut it by that amount.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600031#FF00400","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1383749700,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I echo and agree with everything Senator Power said.  I spoke about this on Second Stage yesterday so I will not repeat myself but I am concerned because I know part of the narrative is that the payment is going up for some people while it is going down for others.  The payment is going down for 95% while it is going up for 5%.<\/p> <p> Ms Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council said a reduction of maternity benefit will force many women to go back to work earlier than they wish to.  This is not in the best interests of women, their children or society as a whole.  Senator Power has clearly outlined that some employers pay a top-up payment to women on maternity leave.  In this case the employer may take a financial hit but some will not choose to take such a hit.  We may see that significant classes and types of job will be directly cut by this reduction.  Ms Tanya Ward of the Children's Rights Alliance has stated that Ireland is currently in the middle of a baby boom and to reduce maternity benefit at this time is economically counterproductive, counter-intuitive and will discourage women from having babies.<\/p><p>The difficulty is that the taxation measure came into effect from 1 July 2013, so it is beginning to hit now.  That figure of &euro;3,500 combined with this cut and the taxation measure sends out a damaging signal to women.  I would like to see Ireland move to a combined system of maternity and paternity leave.  In that way we could bring about greater gender equality because employers would regard men and women in the same way.  However, it is a regressive step to reduce the amount.<\/p><p>It is not just NGOs who are warning about this.  IBEC has also warned that some companies may have to review their maternity benefits as a result.  Top-up payments to bring salaries up to normal levels during maternity leave are standard practice in most companies.  For example, IBEC's head of HR development, Ms Mary Connaughton, said the change could cost the typical large employer with 12 employees on maternity leave an extra &euro;10,000 a year.  That is something they would have to consider.  That is why I have tabled an amendment to oppose these cuts.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600031#FF00500","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383750300,"counter":357,"content":"<p>I also spoke against this section on Second Stage and indicated that I would oppose it on Committee Stage.  The Minister will be aware of my party's opposition to this measure.  The latest cut to maternity benefit comes on the back of reduced maternity benefits dating from 1 July this year.  As the Minister knows, they were subject to tax.  The majority of maternity benefit recipients will now see their weekly payment cut by &euro;32, which is a significant amount.  It amounts to a cut of &euro;832 over their six months leave.<\/p><p>For many new mothers maternity benefit is their only income during that time.  Other Senators have spoken about mothers who are fortunate enough to have their maternity benefit supplemented by their employers.  However, the cumulative impact of this Government's cut and the tax measure could see the benefit shrink by as much as &euro;126, which is a potential loss of up to &euro;3,276.  In a written response to my party, Barnardos described this cut as anti-parenting, callous and unsupportive.  That was that charity's view of this cut.  Barnardos also pointed out that Ireland lags behind many EU countries in only offering six months maternity leave.  We still have no paid paternity leave, which is also a problem.  All of this will exacerbate the financial pressures on women.  It will unfortunately force more women back to work earlier than they want to, when they wish to be with their children and look after them as much as they possibly can.<\/p><p>I would like to read some e-mails I have received from constituents.  I am sure the Minister has also received them.  Their views reflect how this cut will impact upon them.  Public representatives can give their views which may be interpreted by the Minister as being political.  It does no harm to remind ourselves of how these cuts impact on people out in the real world.<\/p><p>One lady told me that the recent cut to maternity benefit, following as it does so closely behind the taxation of this benefit that came into play in July, can be interpreted in only one way: &quot;You don't want working women to have families.&quot;  She continued: &quot;I have been in full-time tax-paying employment since I was 19 years old, so I have now been working almost half my life.  I am the only source of income in my family as my husband has been unable to find employment and we are not in receipt of any social welfare benefit.  I oppose this cut.&quot;<\/p><p>Another person wrote: &quot;Although the HSE publicly states that babies should be breastfed exclusively for six months, most women have to return to work somewhere around the baby's fifth month.  Maternity leave must be taken at 38 weeks at the latest, and 37 to 42 weeks is a normal term.  The HSE also encourages continued breastfeeding for two years in line with World Health Organization guidelines, but there is no support in legislation beyond six months.  If you want healthy future taxpayers, you need to rethink your fiscal policies.&quot;<\/p><p>Another lady wrote: &quot;Before the benefit was taxed, some of us were able to save a bit so that we could avail of some unpaid leave to extend the time at home.  After the tax, maybe some of us could beg or borrow enough to do that, but after this latest budget many families will struggle to survive the six months paid leave.&quot;  The final e-mail states: &quot;We have one son born before the cuts, and it has been a major financial struggle so I can't possibly see how we could have another with these cuts.&quot;<\/p><p>That gives a flavour of the hundreds of e-mails I got.

I will start with what the Department is spending in this area.  In 2005, which is roughly the period when the boom began, the expenditure by the Department on maternity benefit was &euro;132 million.  To emphasise the increase in payments that occurred after the boom, expenditure on maternity benefits in 2012 had risen to &euro;303 million.  One of the difficulties I have had in framing the budget is that during the boom the number of recipients for all the different social welfare schemes went up hugely.  When the crash happened, as Senator Norris said earlier, that climbed even more because 250,000 jobs were lost.<\/p><p>As Minister, I am trying to maintain a social welfare system which is strongly supportive, but savings have to be made in certain areas.  I was asked to prioritise child benefit in particular this year.  Women who have had a baby receive child benefit immediately, which is an additional &euro;130 per month.  <\/p><p>Even after this reduction, maternity benefit payments in Ireland are among the highest in Europe.  In most of Europe, including Britain and Northern Ireland, the vast bulk of maternity benefit payments are paid by employers in the same context as the sick pay issues we discussed on the last amendment.  I pondered long and hard over making any reduction in social welfare for any category of people.  I made very difficult decisions but we are trying to maintain the integrity of the social welfare system. <\/p> <p> As to the shortfall in the Social Insurance Fund, expenditure more than doubled in the period in question.  I do not contest Senators' remarks on the importance of good, paid maternity arrangements for mothers, fathers and, in particular, children.  Our child benefit rate of &euro;130 per month from the moment of the child's birth represents a significant payment, well in excess of many of our European neighbours, including our nearest neighbour and north of the Border.<\/p><p>I take issue with some of the comments of Senators.  Compared internationally, we provide relatively generous maternity leave entitlements, currently at 42 weeks comprising 26 weeks of paid leave and a further 16 weeks of unpaid leave.  This reflects one of the highest birth rates in Europe and a relatively high level of participation by women in the labour force.  The 26-week duration is preserved in the budget.  As a mother, I know how important that time is for families.<\/p><p>I accept Senator Power's statement on breast feeding.  I strongly support breast feeding.  Our maternity services should encourage it further, but that is probably a different issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600032#GG00700","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383750900,"counter":364,"content":"<p>The Minister is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600033#HH00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1383750900,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Under European legislation, we are required to provide 14 weeks, but we provide 26 paid weeks.  In the Netherlands and France, for example, only 16 weeks of maternity benefit is paid.  This shows how good Ireland is.  Sometimes, we undersell the strength of our agreed framework of social protection among all parties and none.  As a country, we can be proud of it.<\/p><p>These savings are important.  The people in receipt of the lowest levels of maternity benefit comprise a relatively small group, but they were identified as being in particular need of support, for example, people without full insurance cover or with relatively few hours of work or atypical arrangements and, therefore, who do not qualify.  Their rate is being increased from &euro;217 to &euro;230.<\/p><p>I have some details on other countries.  The rate in France is 16 weeks, comprising six weeks before confinement and ten weeks after.  This is what France's public social insurance covers, although many of its employers pay in full.  In France, the social insurance system is set up in an independent way.  In Germany, the period is 14 weeks at &euro;13 per day from social insurance, amounting to a payment of approximately &euro;90 per week.  Contrast this with our rate of &euro;230.<\/p><p>Sufficient credit has not been given in this discussion to all of those employers who pay full wages to staff on maternity leave.  Employers in Ireland have a good record in this respect.  It is important that this be recognised.  It can be more of a burden for smaller employers, but we have employers with a strong sense of responsibility.  Our public sector probably has the most generous regime of maternity leave and support for parents of any country in Europe.  This is done at significant cost, but we try to be family friendly through our social insurance system.<\/p><p>In the UK, including north of the Border, people receive &euro;136 per week.  Forgive me for comparing rates, as our situation is the most important issue, but we are a small, competitive economy that is maintaining comparatively positive rates of social protection in the teeth of difficulties imposed on the fund by an historic financial crisis.<\/p><p>Senator Bradford asked about this year's savings.  They are in the order of &euro;30 million, or &euro;36 million in a full year.  I hope that this information is helpful to Senators.  Many of our employers strongly support their staff who are on maternity leave.  I am happy to say that this is one of the best supportive situations for employees.  Our payment amounts to &euro;230 per week.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane and others referred to a tax situation.  In many cases, the principle adopted in the reform of social welfare is that social welfare payments should be subject to taxation in the same way that payment from employment is subject to taxation.  One pays tax if one's income gives rise to a taxable income tax charge.  Under the reform, all flows of income, including social welfare payments, are treated the same way for tax purposes.  In fact, our system had an anomaly.  Some people on maternity leave were being fully paid by their employers while also receiving maternity benefit payments, which were not subject to tax.  They had an advantage over people in work who paid tax on all of their earnings.  During the time of the previous Government, the Commission on Taxation recommended that this anomaly be rectified.<\/p><p>As the House knows, we are under the gaze of all sorts of interlocutors who want us to adopt the reforms recommended internally, for example, by the commission in approximately 2009.  The Minister for Finance put this provision in place last year.  I assure Senator Cullinane that its impact on low-income people is very limited, as many of our employers top up their employees' maternity entitlements to or nearly to their full salary rates.  This is a particular feature of the Irish system.<\/p><p>We pay maternity benefit for 26 weeks whereas countries such as France and the Netherlands only pay for 16 weeks and the EU requirement is 14 weeks.  I am happy to say that we have maintained the number of weeks.  It should also be borne in mind that expenditure in this regard has increased from &euro;132 million in 2005 to &euro;303 million in 2012.  From these figures, Senators can see the expenditure pressure on the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600033#HH00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1383750900,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I applaud the Minister for her comments following my colleague, Senator Power's contribution on breast feeding.

A saving of &euro;36 million is a significant sum.  It is difficult for any Minister in a pressing economic environment to find such a saving.  One of the arguments that can be made in support of this measure is the introduction of free GP care for under fives, which should be of assistance to the mothers financially disadvantaged to the tune of &euro;36 million.  I am sure much thought has gone into this proposal and that the Minister is in some instances having to rob Peter to pay Paul and vice versa.  Her choices are difficult.  I do not envy her the task.<\/p><p>The Minister referred earlier to various reports and recommendations and comparisons with Europe.  I agree with her that we sometimes flail ourself a little too strongly.  We hear much about the Swedish, Finnish and other models, in respect of which everything is supposed to be perfect.  The same is said about the Canadian, Australian and Dutch health insurance models.  They are all marvellous until one examines them in detail and finds the starting point should be elsewhere.<\/p><p>I appreciate the reason the Minister must introduce these measures.  It is hoped that over the next 12 months she will have an opportunity to engage in a more in-depth reform of the system.  While many reports on the issue have been published, it is difficult to pick and choose.  It must be within the Minister's capacity to secure enormous savings within her Department from an administrative perspective.  I accept we will have further opportunity to speak more generally on the forthcoming social welfare Bill.  We must look at how real savings in administration can be made, perhaps by way of reduction in some of the schemes via means testing and so on.  I look forward to participating in that process.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for defending what I know she and I always find difficult enough to defend.  If times were better, we would be complaining that not enough of an increase was being given.  None of us can be happy with measures which cost women, families and children.  However, we must be realistic in terms of the times in which we live.  If I were to propose that the Minister not introduce this measure she would be entitled to ask me from where would she get the saving required.  Perhaps at some stage she will reflect on the suggestion made in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Denis Naughten, namely, that approximately &euro;100 million could be saved if we moved to a system of payment of child benefit based on school attendance, with obvious adjustments in respect of children who, owing to illness or otherwise, are not in a position to attend school.  As I understand it, that such a scheme would save &euro;100 million appears to stand up.  No child in this country would be disadvantaged.  Child benefit would not be paid in respect of children who do not attend school in this country.  We will have to start considering proposals which could result in savings and no child being disadvantaged.  I do not expect the Minister to respond now to that issue.

They have done this with maternity benefit and adoptive benefit.  They have picked out groups and said, \"We can get a lump out of them and we can say then that we have kept our promise not to cut social welfare rates by not technically cutting a broad swathe of recipients\".  However, at the same time, they are hurting categories of people who are in a minority but who could be in a difficult position.  For instance, it could be mothers or the elderly who use telephones or adoptive parents who are affected by this section.  They have been subject to particularly harsh cuts.  Benefits such as the disability allowance or the bereavement grant are not paid out of the goodness of the Minister's heart; they are paid for by recipients who have accumulated stamps over the years.  They are entitled to these benefits because they have been promised them and they have paid for them.  They have a contract with the Department.  These are not social assistance payments that the Minister or the Government of the day decide to dish out.  There is a solemn contract between the State and the citizen.  The citizen pays a price for the performance of the contract but that is being disregarded by the Minister as she slashes benefits.  A great deal has been said about the actions of the previous Government but it adopted a simple approach whereby everybody paid a contribution.  Those who could pay most paid most and those who could pay least paid the least.  We did not pick out any group for heavy cuts apart from the wealthiest who were subject to higher tax and USC charges.  The Minister has decided not to target the rich at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600035#LL00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1383752100,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il cut the Christmas bonus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600035#LL00400","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1383752100,"counter":382,"content":"<p>The Christmas bonus equated to a 2% cut in social welfare payments at the time while the wealthiest civil servants were subject to double digit percentage pay cuts and higher earners had to pay much more tax.  There was a fairness across society.  People were hurt and they had to pay more but we did not target particular groups.  The Labour Party is aware of this.  We heard about the loaves and fishes yesterday.  That is not the case in this instance because the Government is not bereft of resources unlike our Lord who conducted the miracle of the loaves and fishes and fed all the people.  This is a reference to a comment by a Labour Party Senator yesterday.  I do not criticise him personally because I compliment him on the motif but in that example everybody was treated fairly.  The Labour Party is not doing that.  It is picking out groups to target unfairly and hoping there will not be enough people to push back against the Government.  However, groups have been hit, one of which is adoptive parents.  This is also related to the maternity benefit cut as well.  The Labour Party seems to have a thing against young families.  It is supposed to be the party that represents them.  It has not done so and it has allowed the rich to get away scot free.  They can do what they like.  They are the entrepreneurs and go getters to whom the party aspires while everyone else gets left behind.  People are struggling with their mortgages and cannot afford to pay for funerals while pregnant women are struggling with families, trying to pay the bills the Minister is imposing on them.<\/p><p>Everybody would understand that she has a job to do with the troika if she did it fairly but the ESRI studies have consistently said that she has decided to do the job unfairly.  That is mainly because she has been unable to tackle the influence of Fine Gael, which is putting out a line that the Labour Party is buying into that the Minister is dealing with scroungers on social welfare.  The benefit covered by this section is for working people who have paid into a benefit scheme and because private sector companies generally cannot provide these services, the State has done so.  The same applies to maternity benefit.  The recipients are not scroungers; they are contributors to society.  They receive benefits in return for the payments they make to the Exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund as the insurance need arises.  This is a particularly vicious cut which is related to section 5 and it deserves to be opposed.  It highlights the targeting of groups by this Labour Party Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600035#LL00500","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1383752100,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I will not rehearse the discussion we had on section 5 but I endorse it and it is related to this issue.  Has the Minister given consideration to providing surrogacy leave?  The Equality Authority has advised on this; I refer to the Ms Z case.  A teacher with a rare medical condition preventing her from carrying a pregnancy, although she had healthy ovaries, arranged for a surrogate to give birth to herself and her husband's genetic child using IVF.  The child was born in April 2010.  The woman applied to the Department of Education and Skills for paid maternity leave and was refused.  She was offered unpaid parental leave by her employers.  She took a case to the Equality Tribunal and it ended up before the European Court of Justice.  One of the court's advocate generals suggested that since adoptive parents are entitled to maternity leave under EU law, the national courts could assess whether it is illegal to apply different rules to adoptive parents and parents through surrogacy while another advocate general said that where surrogacy is allowed in a country, the mother taking care of the baby was entitled to leave to ensure the unhindered development of the mother-child relationship.  The Equality Authority has advised the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide support to the small number of families availing of surrogacy similar to that provided to adoptive parents.

I hope the Government will address that issue because it has been left on the long finger for too long and a series of anomalous cases have arisen.  I agree with some of what has been said but I do not agree with the party spin because the Government is in a difficult position.  The Minister has made difficult choices.  She has halved the demands that were made on her.  Choices have to be made.  They are awful and I would not want to make them but then I would not have started from there because the entire system should be pulled down.  Unfortunately, this is what one gets with capitalism.  This is where it leads.  The financial system and everything else should be pulled down and the rights and welfare of people should be given primacy.  I do not see any sign of that happening across Europe.  We are in this situation and starting at the ideological position the Minister now does because there is little socialism around anywhere nowadays.  However, I will ignore that aspect of the debate.

My concern here relates to the implications of this provision for gay and-or single men who have adopted a child.  In the context of a specific reference to \"the woman\", are we to take it that they are they not being given any consideration at all?  After the adjustments that I gather will be made, wisely and in the interests of the welfare of children, by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter - these adjustments might even come about prior to the introduction of same-sex marriage; if such is introduced, as I hope it will be - we could have a situation where two men have adopted a child.

Adoptive benefit is a very small scheme simply because the number of children adopted in this country is very small.  It is a weekly payment made to an adopting employed or self-employed mother or single male who adopts a child and who meets the PRSI condition.  That is set out in the primary legislation.  I personally know a number of single people, both men and women, who have adopted children and been eligible for adoptive benefit since the time in the early 1990s when that developed as a practice.<\/p> <p> Senators van Turnhout and Norris raised the surrogacy issue.  The Minister for Justice and Equality brought a working paper before the Cabinet yesterday on legislative changes which will be made in respect of families and children.  Medical technology is advancing in respect of surrogacy and various forms of assisted reproduction, and the law in Ireland needs to change.  The Government is committed to making those changes.  The Government agreed yesterday to put to the people a referendum on same-sex marriage.  In that context, it will be necessary to introduce certain legal changes on adoption provisions as they affect same-sex couples.  That legislation will be brought forward in due course by the Minister.  There are difficult issues in respect of surrogacy because poor women in certain countries are being used in surrogacy arrangements.  That issue must be addressed.  The arrangement raised by Senator van Turnhout is quite different to that.  The Department inherited that case from the previous Administration, but with the addressing of surrogacy issues in the proposed legislation, I would hope that we will be able to come to an arrangement for that case.  However, there are still important issues with some surrogacy practices in some countries that we need to address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600036#MM04000","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383753300,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I call on Senator Byrne to speak on section 6.

The difficulty I experience in dealing daily with that payment is that up to a few years ago that payment was available regularly, in other words, if an individual had an exceptional need they went to the social welfare office and were given a payment to meet the exceptional need.  Now it is a once-off payment and one cannot have an exceptional need on a regular basis, such as every six months.<\/p> <p>Community welfare officers are implementing that approach based on current Government policy.  The Minister might address that issue, which was raised here in the context of that payment being used.  No one can argue that a bereavement is not an exceptional need but the argument that a payment from the office of the community welfare officer or an exceptional needs payment is there to meet every ill does not hold up because a community welfare officer, on a practical basis, will tell a client that he or she cannot approve any more than one payment at present because of Government policy.<\/p><p>With regard to the other grants the Minister outlined yesterday, she mentioned that a grant of &euro;6,000 was available.  While we are aware of such grants, they are exceptionally difficult to obtain.  She might outline the qualifying criteria for them.  <\/p><p>The Minister said yesterday that there is a need to examine the cost of funerals.  Why was that not examined, by way of a review or otherwise, by her Department in advance of bringing in this universal cut which will affect the least well off more disproportionately than the well off?  That is where the difficulty arises with this payment, namely, that it is a universal payment that is being withdrawn.  Instead of universally withdrawing the payment, could it not have been dealt with in a manner that would have protected the least well off in society?  Could a measure not have been introduced in the budget to withdraw the &euro;850 payment for those who can afford burials but to leave it in place for those who cannot afford them?  The argument has been made that the money can be obtained through the other two grants but those two grants would have been available in addition in any event. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600038#OO02200","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383754500,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I am getting confused about this as I believe people do not understand the meaning of a universal payment.

Regardless of whether they were left a big house or a number of properties or savings, they also got the bereavement grant.  If we want to have a social welfare system where the least well off get it and those who are well off do not get it - that is what we strive for here every day when Members stand up in this Chamber and say that the least well off should be the ones who receive this type of payment - this is the only way we can do it.  An exceptional needs payment grant of up to &euro;2,000 is available which is far more substantial than this grant payment of &euro;850. <\/p><p>I have dealt with this issue day in and day out, as I am sure every Senator has, because we all help the bereaved.  Most of the people who have suffered a bereavement that I have helped out did not even know of the existence of this grant.  As late as last week when I attended the funeral of a colleague of Deputy &Oacute; Domhnaill, the late Denis Foley, and was standing in the queue with people in the church, they asked me what was this bereavement grant that they were all talking about.

As I said yesterday, this measure will result in departmental savings in expenditure of approximately &euro;22 million but there will also be further savings because there was an additional scheme, a small scheme, which required a certain amount of administration.  Therefore, there will be administrative savings and staff savings, which we are obliged to find in terms of the troika regime.  As Senator Moloney said, the bereavement grant is based on insurance contributions.  Therefore, it has never been targeted at those who are most in need.  For instance, people who are on a lifelong disability payment, unless they are otherwise insured, would not get the payment nor would most farmers unless they were self-employed people or were an employee of a farm company and were paying contributions.  The majority of small farmers, the type of people the Department assists through farm assist, would be unlikely to qualify for the payment.<\/p><p>For those people who have particular difficulties, the exceptional needs payment is available.  As has been said, the payments under that heading range from &euro;1,000 upwards.  The annual expenditure by the Department under that heading is more than &euro;5 million.  Therefore, it is a significant payment to quite a number of people who can be in the most difficulty at the time of a family bereavement.<\/p><p>The biggest supports we give are to widows, widowers and survivors whose spouses or partners have died, that is, the contributory survivor's and non-contributory survivor's pension, which is paid at a relatively generous rate.  That availability of the survivor's pension is the biggest single support.<\/p><p>The second significant payment is that if the person who has died was in receipt of a social welfare payment, their spouse, widow, widower or surviving partner continues to receive the social welfare payment of the individual for a further six weeks.  On average, that is worth about &euro;1,200, which again is much more significant that the &euro;850 payment, and if, for instance, the person was a pensioner and had a half rate carer's allowance, the payment would be approximately &euro;2,100.  Those are significant commitments to the immediate surviving next of kin, which is where, as with the widow's and widowers' pension, the money ought to go because they are the immediate survivors, rather than it going to the distant relatives.  In addition, where a widow, widower or surviving partner has a child under the age of 18 or a child under the age of 22 who is continuing in full-time education, there is a cash payment of &euro;6,000.  Again, that is much more significant than the payment that is being brought to an end here.  I want to stress to Senators that this payment is to the immediate relatives and dependants of the person who has died. <\/p> <p>I repeat that the context in which this is being done is one in which I have had to find savings, frankly.  It must have been pleasant for previous Ministers in this Department who had substantial budget largesse to distribute.  We are trying to get the economy back on its feet and get people back to work.  We are maintaining a supportive social welfare system.  We are trying to target the benefits.  I put it to the Senators that we have tried to do that in the best way possible, by maintaining a very significant payment to an immediate relative - the widow or widower - of the person who has died and his or her dependent children, if there are any.  I think, in policy terms, that is where the money should be spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600039#PP00700","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383755100,"counter":482,"content":"<p>I am sorry that I missed the initial moving of the amendment under discussion and the contributions of some colleagues.  I have listened with interest to what the Minister has had to say in response.  We have to respect the requirement for a balanced approach that ensures needs are met but also ensures this can be funded.  We would not be having this discussion, and the financial impact of the abolition of the bereavement grant would not be as significant, if the cost of funerals in this country was not so high.  The Minister will appreciate that since our friend Gay Mitchell left the Oireachtas, we no longer receive an annual address on funeral costs as we used to do.  Former Deputy Mitchell was always to the fore in comparing funeral costs in this country with those in our EU neighbours.  Perhaps some Department other than the Department of Social Protection is responsible for this matter.  I never know who is in charge as titles and portfolios change.  The Minister might ask her Government colleague who is responsible for these matters to investigate why funeral costs in this country appear to be much higher than the European average.  The bereavement grant will no longer be available to offer financial assistance to families who are presented with substantial bills at a difficult emotional time for them, but the bill will still remain.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Moloney that the difficulty with saying that exceptional needs payments can generally be made by community welfare offices across the country in cases of difficulty, for example, following a bereavement or the withdrawal of a medical card, is that one office might approve an application, but another office might refuse an identical application.  There does not appear to be a standard response to requests for exceptional needs payments.

Sections 9 and 10 are linked and we have tabled amendments to section 10 that also affect section 9.  We will wait until we get to them.<\/p><p>Section 9 cuts young people's jobseeker's rates.  I reminded the Minister that when the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government cut dole payments for those aged under 25 in budget 2010, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted against the proposal, arguing, and the Minister was quite vociferous, along with my party and many others that it did nothing to address the shortage of jobs and that because there were insufficient places in education and training, it would drive even more people to emigrate.  Apart from having different parties in government nothing has changed since then and the logic unfortunately seems to be the same.  Some young people will be forced to emigrate because of the provisions in this section.<\/p><p>The measure still does nothing to address the shortage of jobs.  Some small progress has been made in employment in recent times, but when emigration is considered, we still have a long way to go to create the jobs that people need, especially young people and graduates coming out of college.  We do not have enough training and education places.  Despite the Government pledge and the allocation of funding in the budget, which I will discuss shortly, it will still not cater for the volume of young people who will need opportunities.  Those people who will not get those opportunities will incur a significant reduction in their jobseeker's allowance.<\/p><p>As I said on Second Stage, people from disadvantaged communities and backgrounds will lose out disproportionately because they will be furthest away from the education and training opportunities and labour-activation measures to get jobs.  However, their benefits will be cut.  Therefore, I cannot support this section.<\/p><p>In discussing these cuts, the Minister spoke about funding for the European youth guarantee.  The National Youth Council of Ireland reckons it represents just 5% of the estimated annual cost of what is needed for a genuine youth guarantee scheme that would cover all of the young people who are unemployed.  It estimates that the cuts will impact on 20,853 young job seekers in 2014 and that the numbers will increase thereafter.  While the Minister can confirm or deny the number, I understand the budget only guarantees an extra 3,250 places in education, training or work experience.  There are 32 job seekers for every advertised job vacancy.  Young people cannot be incentivised into places, paid or otherwise, that do not exist.  The Government often uses that word &quot;incentivise&quot;.  It is even included in one of the Fianna F&aacute;il amendments and while I do not think it was intentional on the author's part sometimes it can give the connotation that young people need to be incentivised to get work.  I believe it is the reverse.  Young people want to work and would be the first to take up work when given the opportunity.  The age profile of those who have emigrated indicates it is young people who have taken the risk to leave their families and go abroad.<\/p><p>I believe young people want to work and be in training.  The Government is being disingenuous in pretending that by cutting the rate of social welfare for young people, as it is doing in this section, it is somehow helping or incentivising young people to go into training, education or work.  That does not stack up at all and is deeply unfair on those young people who will be affected.  Some 18,000 fewer young people are in paid employment compared with when the Government came to office.  I come from Waterford in the south east.  The Minister will know that while we have high levels of unemployment across the State, we have very dangerously high levels of unemployment in Waterford city especially, but also across the south east.  The most recent CSO figures for Waterford city indicate a rate of unemployment of about 24% with youth unemployment at about 35%.  Therefore, a disproportionate number of young people in my city and county will pay the price because of the cuts in this section.<\/p><p>The JobBridge scheme has led to around 20,000 unpaid internships over a similar timeframe.  The &euro;50 top-up on top of the &euro;100 young person's dole equates to approximately &euro;3.75 an hour for a 40-hour week.  That is what we are offering young people.<\/p><p>The National Youth Council of Ireland is not happy with some of the claims the Minister has made, the first being that existing welfare payments for those under 26 represent a disincentive to work.  I do not believe that is the case.  I made the point that many young people want to work.  There is plenty of incentive for people to work.  A young person who takes up a job paying &euro;300 or &euro;400 a week is very much incentivised to go and work if those opportunities exist.<\/p> <p>I imagine the Minister would agree that for the vast majority of young people if those jobs and opportunities were available they certainly would take them.<\/p><p>The Minister has also said that she will implement the youth guarantee scheme.  However, the Minister is only putting aside &euro;14 million for this while the is estimate that this would only represent 5% of the necessary cost and that in fact &euro;273 million per annum would be needed for a genuine youth guarantee scheme.  In the context of this section I call on the Minister to update us on the scheme.  I gather Senator van Turnhout has called for a debate on the issue and the Minister has generously offered to come back to the House and take part in a more constructive debate when we have more time.  This is an important stand-alone issue.  Anyway, I call on the Minister to take some time to briefly bring us up to speed on the position at the moment.  I could say a good deal more but I am conscious that other Senators want to make their contributions.  I will wait until the Minister responds before I say more.<\/p><p>I believe this cut is wrong.  The Minister took the view that the cut was wrong when she was in opposition, like many of the other cuts.  If it was wrong when Fianna F&aacute;il imposed the cut why is it right now?  Why was Fianna F&aacute;il wrong and the Minister right in 2010 when she vociferously opposed it, yet she has cut it further and it is the right thing to do now?  That does not stack up and perhaps the Minister can enlighten me on her logic in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600043#TT00200","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383756900,"counter":512,"content":"<p>Yesterday on Second Stage I highlighted the fact that this is a critical issue.  I believe the cut is regressive and is likely to exacerbate the difficulties that these young people are already experiencing in getting back into employment and training.

Therefore, there is nothing to support the narrative being spun that young people are sitting on sofas at home or whatever.

Therefore, I will not use my time today to go through each of the questions.  However, I am concerned about these cuts because of the overall message we are sending to young people.  We are cutting the jobseeker's allowance but not enough appropriate training places are available.  I will discuss the youth guarantee shortly but we have cut funding successively to youth work organisations.  We should consider all of these things as a cumulative package.<\/p><p>I welcomed the Minister's commitment yesterday in the Seanad to the effect that she would come back for a debate on the youth guarantee.

I seek clarification on the commitment made to have the debate by then.  The timing of the debate should factor in when the plan becomes available to us and the plan should be the basis of the debate before it is submitted to the Commission.  That would allow time for us to play a role in ensuring that we get buy-in and include all the people that need to be included in the plan.  It is critical that we get this right.<\/p><p>This should be a joint initiative between the Department of Social Protection and the Departments of Education and Skills, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Children and Youth Affairs because labour and activation issues are not in a vacuum.  From my own experience of youth work organisations I believe they can play a critical role.<\/p><p>I saw a little of the Oireachtas committee earlier today.  We heard it eloquently described how youth work organisations were getting at some of the hard-to-reach young people and how the organisations were able to engage them into the workplace.  Youth workers have a real insight and trust with young people.  If we think about it, most adults in a young person's life are not there by choice.  We do not choose our parents, teachers or doctors.  However, traditionally a youth worker or someone involved in a young person's life in that way can have a significant role.  I am conscious that there were excellent presentations made on the youth guarantee today and therefore I will not speak to it too much.  However, I am concerned about the original or initial allocation of &euro;14 million earmarked for it.  In reality, and if we are serious, the figure should be approximately &euro;100 million in the first year because a total of &euro;66 million of that sum would be reimbursed from the EU.  We have to spend the money first and then it is reimbursed.  Therefore, the cost to the State will be &euro;34 million.  We need more clarity on the numbers, places and the budget available.  Let us consider the &euro;46 million figure.  What are the costings for the 1,500 JobBridge places?  What are the costings for JobsPlus for young jobseekers?  What are the costings for the 1,000 extra places on T&uacute;s?  What are the costings for the 750 new places on the momentum scheme?<\/p><p>My colleague, Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, cannot be here today, unfortunately, but he has asked me to raise with the Minister the situation for professional actors who are currently in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance.  They have been told they must go on T&uacute;s programmes for one year.  The result of this will effectively mean that they must put their profession on hold for that time.  The reason is they are not seeking full-time employment according to the Department of Social Protection.  The Department sees their acting as a sideline hobby.  Senator Mac Conghail sent me correspondence he received which detailed how a young actor was told that he cannot take up part-time work.  By its very nature, acting is about short, part-time work.  The person at the Intreo centre said everyone would like to be famous but that when an actor is not working he is not an actor, he is unemployed.  The official insisted that the actor should go on a one-year training course with T&uacute;s if he wanted to continue to qualify for the jobseeker's allowance.  This individual has said he is happy to do part-time work to supplement his income and he is only seeking the half-time jobseeker's allowance.  There is something about understanding the nature of acting because it tends to be short work unless one gets a job in a soap opera.  Even then, one is at the discretion of the writer.<\/p><p>The difficulty is that the T&uacute;s programme involves working for 19.5 hours per week, which is great when the employer will give actors the flexibility to do acting jobs.  However, if not, ultimately, they cannot take up the work that they are keen to do.  This applies not only in the case of actors.  I have heard from many young people about the need for flexibility and the opportunity to take a chance when a chance comes upon them.  A person could be offered a three-month placement.  If a person takes a three-month work placement or a job it is fantastic but the transition to get back onto jobseeker's allowance is so long that we must question whether it is worth it.  Naturally, it is worth it to have a job but what if it represents a detrimental decision financially?  We need to consider how people transfer in and out of jobs.  We are in a far more flexible workplace now.  If a person takes a three-month opportunity, often a job will come out of it.  However, it is a leap of faith and it is a case of trying to find the flexibility and ensure that people can transition.<\/p><p>Yesterday in her speech on Second Stage the Minister referred to JobsPlus.  She stated, &quot;I want to tell Members here, many of whom are actively involved in employment or familiar with many employers, that on 1 January, young jobseekers aged under 26 will qualify for JobsPlus if they are without employment for more than six months&quot;.   My understanding was that this was for people aged under 25.  Will the Minister clarify that she meant under 26 years?  Was that correct?  It would be welcome news if this was the case.<\/p><p>We have discussed flexibility and training places and the issues I have outlined in my questions.  Let us consider the figures and leave aside the quality of the places, which is one of the arguments.  Let us consider the increase in payments if a person goes back on an education programme and the differentials that arise.  A person aged 25 years on jobseeeker's allowance gets &euro;144 up to a maximum of &euro;160 per week if she goes on the back-to-education allowance scheme.  The incentive in that case is &euro;16 per week.  Likewise, a young person aged 18 to 24 years will get &euro;100 on schemes such as JobBridge with a maximum of &euro;150.  This is a low income to live on, especially if people have to pay the costs of getting to their place of internship, lunch, clothes and all the things that come with it.  Can we consider working towards having a basic rate for all those in education or training and having the same rate across the board?  It could be an allowance of &euro;188 or something that would represent an incentive, something we could look at in time to work to such that not every scheme is different.<\/p> <p>I agree that every young person is different and for some, the back to education programme or the JobBridge scheme is the right choice at present.  For the sake of &euro;10 or &euro;20, I would not like young people to make a different choice that is not in their best interests on a purely monetary basis.  Members do not want that as they want such people to get back on the pathway to the right place to which they wish to go.  Consequently, streamlining should be considered and a way found to have all young people on the same rate.  I will leave it there for the present but these are some of the issues I have with regard to the cuts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600044#UU00400","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383757500,"counter":516,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il is strongly opposed to this section of the legislation.  While I acknowledge changes were introduced under the previous Government for a reduced rate of payment for 18 and 19-year olds, there was a good rationale for that because it is not right that someone would go straight from school onto the dole.  Unfortunately, there is a history in many areas of intergenerational dependence on social welfare and the rationale behind that change was to break this cycle and to give young people an incentive to take up training and educational opportunities and to make sure they get out there and have the incentive to work.  However, there is a hell of a difference between that and now paying 25-year olds &euro;100 per week.  In many cases, such young people not only have an undergraduate degree but also have masters level qualifications.  Consequently, it does not add up for the Government to suggest such people will receive a higher rate of payment if they undergo a back to education course, a F&Aacute;S course or some other lower level of educational or training course.  These are young people who have educational qualifications and who would grab a job with both hands, if they could get one.<\/p><p>However, the reality for many young graduates is that jobs simply are not available and this is the reason there is such a shockingly high rate of youth unemployment.  Moreover, the youth unemployment rate of 30% does not capture those who have left the country because of the lack of opportunities for them here.  It simply refers to the young people who remain here and, consequently, the true figure is far higher.  I have no doubt that including 25 and 26-year olds in this cut is not an activation measure and it is deeply disingenuous to try to sell it as such.  It is a cut and an attempt to make savings from a particularly vulnerable generation and ultimately, all it will be is an incentive to emigrate because people cannot live on &euro;100 per week.<\/p><p>Jobseeker's allowance is only payable to those who have low income in the first place.  It is a means-tested scheme and such people will not qualify for it if there is a decent level of parental income in the household and if they are living at home.  They will only qualify if they are living as part of a low-income family or if they are supporting themselves.  I refer to people who live in families that cannot afford to look after their financial needs and which in many cases struggled to get the young person through college and to meet all the costs of education.  It is deeply unfair for someone in that situation to come out at the other end only to be denied financial support and, consequently, I urge the Minister to rethink this measure, particularly at the higher end of this age bracket.<\/p><p>There are different categories of young people and Senator van Turnhout mentioned that for some,training might well be appropriate.  However, the measure that has been introduced for such a wide group of people is too crude.  Some people within that age cohort are early school leavers who would benefit from taking part in a relatively basic educational course or from availing of the back to education scheme to acquire a college qualification and so on.  However, others at the far end are highly educated and certainly the last thing they need after four, five or in some cases six years in college is more education.  What they need is a job.<\/p><p>Moreover, there are not enough places on the education side to cater for those who have educational needs and there are not enough places on the training side for those who have the requisite education but not training.  The Government has referred repeatedly to the youth guarantee, which all Members strongly support.  However, the necessary resources are not being put into backing it up and ensuring that every young person is offered an education, training or work placement that is relevant to that young person, which recognises the qualifications and skill levels he or she already has and gives such people something that will make them more job ready and help them to gain paid employment.  This is the big gap in this regard, as such a guarantee is not in place.  Nowhere near enough places are being offered for the full age cohort, in which there are more than 66,000 people, as the number of places available is only a fraction of that number.<\/p><p>While this measure is extremely unfair, in the post-budget analysis, media coverage and so on, it appears in large part to have passed by quite quickly, as perhaps some of the media analysts and others who were commenting on it do not understand the impact it has.  However, all the different groups that appeared before the Joint Committee on Social Protection, including the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and the National Youth Council of Ireland have pointed out the really severe impact this will have on young people.  It does not add up from an economic point of view either because while the State has spent and invested in getting a top-class education for young people and getting them to degree level, ultimately, all they are being handed is a one-way ticket to Canada, Australia or someone else.  They are being told to go off there for a few years because the State wishes to disincentivise them in respect of giving them the opportunity to seek employment here.  Many young people have made the point to me that the reality for people from the country in particular is that to get a job, they are obliged to come to Dublin to seek work.  How on earth is someone supposed to survive in Dublin and actually find a job on &euro;100 per week given the cost of rent and everything else?  This simply takes that opportunity out of their hands altogether and is forcing them towards the airport instead.  This measure is incredibly unfair and it is for that reason Fianna F&aacute;il is opposing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600045#VV00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1383757500,"counter":517,"content":"<p>In the first instance, I wish to refer to a matter that was touched on earlier by the Minister regarding the self-employed.  While the Minister made the case quite well herself, it cannot be stated often enough in this House that under the previous Administration, the Department insisted on the previous year's accounts in the case of a self-employed person who sought social welfare payments.  Obviously, the accounts for the previous year were going to be far better than those for the present year, that is, the year in which the business went to the wall.<\/p><p>The Minister has now brought about a situation in which such self-employed people can present their situation as it exists today and can apply for unemployment assistance.  As a result of this measure, 86% of applicants have been granted social welfare.  I wish to put this on the record of the House because apparently, the word on the street is that self-employed people are not eligible for jobseeker's allowance, which is not perfectly true.<\/p><p>Second, I wish to comment on the cuts being discussed regarding those who are under 26.  Senators Whelan, Landy and I today met the president of USI, representatives from the We're Not Leaving campaign and representatives from the National Youth Council of Ireland.  They had a number of issues, which obviously included those being debated by Members at present, a couple of which have been mentioned by Senator Power.  In this context, they started off by referring to cuts to the social welfare rates.  I told them there actually was no cut to the rate.  As I stated in the Chamber yesterday, a cut is where one is getting an amount of money and someone takes it away.  The reality in this regard is that anyone who is in receipt of social welfare at present at whatever rate will retain that rate.  I acknowledge it is regrettable but all that is happening is the length of time such people will be on that level of payment is being extended.  That is what Members are referring to as a cut, when it is not.<\/p><p>The second problem they raised was their belief that were people in receipt of social welfare payments at a rate of &euro;144 per week to take up part-time employment and were they to go back to reclaim social welfare, they would be put on &euro;100 per week.  I told them this was untrue and again, they could not believe what I was telling them because they already have been misled into believing they would lose money.  The third point they did not know was that married students under the age of 26 are entitled to the full rate of social welfare.  I acknowledge this is a rare case but one often has married students under the age of 26.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600045#VV00300","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1383757500,"counter":518,"content":"<p>That is 1% of the cohort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600045#VV00400","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1383757500,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Yes, but they still are significant.  It still is a fair point that needed to be made and I made it to them.<\/p><p>I agree with another concern they raised and have referred to it previously.  While the Minister has tackled this issue to some degree, it is something that is easily achievable.  I believe Senator van Turnhout also mentioned it.  It pertains to people who are in part-time employment, who were in receipt of social welfare payments and who then go back to claiming social welfare.  I refer to the difficulties that often are highlighted in respect of such people reclaiming social welfare.  It would be very simple to have a payment for them in the post office in the very week they return to claiming unemployment assistance or jobseeker's allowance is now known.  All that needs to happen is for the person to go into the employment exchange, state he or she has part-time work for 13 weeks and ask that his or her payment be suspended for that period.<\/p> <p>This is done to ensure that the person's claim is not closed with the result that the person must go through the rigmarole of reapplying.  At the touch of a button that suspension can be lifted.  I should know.  Within three days the money can be in the post office.  I ask the Minister to bring that issue to the attention of her officials to ensure it is implemented to alleviate the fears that have been expressed.<\/p><p>Senator Averil Power referred to the cost of accessing them courses.  I attended a meeting of the community development project on Monday in my own area.  It runs many courses but the problem is that people do not have the transport to access them.  I made a submission to the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Alan Kelly, and I will make a submission to the Minister requesting that something be done on a pilot basis.  For a small amount of money the community development projects are in a position to provide cars, with the aid of funding from either Department or both, to ensure these people can attend courses.  This is an issue I will follow up with the Minister.  It is a rural issue which involves access to courses and access to transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600045#VV00500","speaker":"1161","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383758100,"counter":521,"content":"<p>Much of the ground has already been covered on Second Stage and up to now on Committee Stage.  It might come as a surprise if I were to say I agree with the comments made by the Taoiseach and others about handing out money to 18 and 19 year olds and that it would be far better to have them on a training course or upskilling.  I also agree there should be more training courses.  Therein lies the problem.  There are not enough training courses in place.  Therefore, the question remains what is to be done about this large cohort of people who, irrespective of what Senator John Kelly said, will have less money in their pocket as a result of this proposal?  The figures are staggering.  Senator David Cullinane has quoted extensively, as others have done, from the National Youth Council's papers in this regard but it is worth emphasising that only an additional 3,250 places have been created for the under 25 year olds while extra places on JobsPlus depends on employers.  Also an OECD report, Getting Youth on the Job Track, found in 2011 that 40% of young people aged 16 to 24 in Ireland were at risk of poverty, which is the highest in the EU.  The Vincentian Partnership states that the cost of a single adult living as part of a household will be &euro;184 in 2014.  Young people on &euro;100 and &euro;144, respectively, will be surviving on incomes well below the poverty line.  Also young jobseekers living with their parents are subject to a means test where the income of their parents is taken into account in a process known as benefit and privilege assessment.  We also know that more than 19,000 applicants under the age of 25 had their application for jobseekers's allowance refused between 2009 and 2012.  This clearly shows, according to the submission, that the payment is going to young people who are living in relatively low income households.  They are the people who will be adversely affected as a result of this proposal.<\/p><p>  The OECD report, Getting Youth on the Job Track, stated:<blockquote>A comprehensive national strategy to tackle the very high unemployment rates among the young is lacking.  Youth policy is fragmented with several Government Departments taking individual action.  A more co-ordinated and tailored approach to this is required.<\/blockquote>Perhaps the Minister would have a view on that particular segment of the OECD report.  It appears there is either duplication or inefficiency across Departments but the end result is that it is not delivering what, presumably, the Minister and her Government colleagues wish to do.<\/p><p>  Some of the other main points in the report make interesting reading but I will not quote all of them.  However, one or two should be highlighted.  It states that at present each case worker in the Department of Social Protection oversees 800 jobseekers, which is high by international standards.  I was astonished that one individual oversees 800 jobseekers.  Therefore, each case worker has a file of 800 people with whom he or she has to deal.  I do not know whether they are doing this exclusively in the jobseeker's area or whether that is part of their additional duties.  One way or the other it appears the Department officials are overloaded with work in this regard and, obviously, it is bound to affect efficiency.  <\/p><p>  Also, we spend only 0.05% of our GDP on placement services while the UK spends 0.19% and the Nordic countries 0.21%.  This disadvantages young jobseekers as they require more support, career advice and job counselling.  The impression seems to be abroad that there will be no great difficulty about this proposal, that at the end of the day all that has to happen is that jobseekers in that cohort between 18 and 25 years of age turn up and they will get on to a course that is suitable and tailored to their needs, which is plainly not the case.  Therefore, the question remains what will the Department do about it?  What is the general Government policy in respect of providing more training places?  Unquestionably, there is a skills shortage in certain sectors of the jobs economy in this country.  We know that in the high-tech area that jobs are available and that there is a shortage of skilled workers.  On Second Stage somebody referred to the lack of language skills.  I have often wondered how it is that the Department has not encouraged more young people to go into language courses, particularly those who, from anecdotal evidence, have done many basic and medium level computer skill courses.  I doubt if there is a young person in the country who does not know how to operate a computer.  It appears there are a number of opportunities in this area that can get young people on to a path to employment.  Again, I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this issue.<\/p><p>  I was particularly interested in Senator Jillian van Turnhout's reference to the experience of an actor to whom she referred.  I am a member of Equity.  On the Social Welfare Bill last year, I raised an issue somewhat similar to that raised by the Senator about those who find themselves resting between jobs.  They are now encouraged to go on to a training course which means that they may not be available for work.  Meetings took place between representatives of Equity and officials of the Minister's Department.  The Minister and I discussed this on more than one occasion in the earlier part of the year.  If the Minster has anything further to add in this regard I would be interested to hear it.  The problem remains that for those who are actors, being forced on to training courses that take them out of the potential jobs market is not in their best interests.  One may contrast that with what has already been decided with the fire fighters where the Minister has already taken an initiative in this regard to ensure they will not be penalised for working part time.  It was in that context that I had raised the position of actors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600046#WW00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1383758100,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Not only the cut but the literature sent out by the Department has been described by others as an invitation to emigrate by the Department of Social Protection.

We have a skills shortage and yet 600 degree holders per week leave the country.  The youth unemployment rate in Europe for those between 15 and 24 years of age is 23%.

We are all agreed this is much more beneficial in the long-term than the jobseeker's allowance.<\/p><p>We welcome the Minister's commitment to finalise and submit the plans to the EU and that they will involve an increased range of enhanced opportunities to those on offer in the form of internships and so on.  The Minister has given a commitment to increase the spend on work, training and education places and related supports available for young jobseekers.  I will not rehearse again the figures supplied by the Department on the increased number of places available.  I think we need to work together to ensure places are available in order that nobody is stuck on jobseeker's allowance when the majority want to be in work, training, education or work placements.  I know the Minister is committed to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600047#XX00100","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1383758700,"counter":524,"content":"<p>This will be a long tiring night.  I have tremendous empathy for the Minister who has a difficult job.  I commend her on the work she is doing.  I was less than impressed with the contributions from the D&aacute;il to which I listened last week.  It was uncomfortable to listen to personal jibes that were directed at the Minister.<\/p><p>I have a problem with the proposed cut.  Regardless of what Members have said, it is a cut.  I play team hurling.  Of the six forwards who were on the team at the beginning of the year, three have left, one to the US, another to Australia and the other to New Zealand.  That scene is replicated in every parish in the country.  Families are pining for their young men and face being apart at Christmas.  This is difficult for family members, especially mothers.  We seldom consider the personal impact of emigration, but it is an issue of which I am very aware because my brother is in New Zealand.  He sees no way to come back.  A weekly payment of &euro;100 is not nearly enough in all fairness.<\/p><p>The comments of those opposite who speak of lads lazing in front of flat screen televisions shows how out of touch they are.  It is easy for those who have enjoyed good wages and never had to worry about money coming in the door to accuse young people of being layabouts and good for nothing.  In fairness that is not the case.  As a young Member of this Chamber, it is incumbent on me to voice my opposition to this cut.  Why has the Minster targeted those who are under 26 years?  Why not pick those who are under 40 years, left handed with ginger hair and live west of the Shannon?  It does not make sense to me.<\/p><p>Young people have a role to play in getting Ireland out of the economic difficulties.  I believe they are effectively being told they are not wanted as there is no room for them.  The people who have some financial support from family and are able to cobble the few pounds together are able to buy a plane ticket and emigrate.  What are the options for those whose families are not able to give financial support?  They must remain at home and live on &euro;100 and remain in a situation that will lead them to poverty.  Senator John Kelly referred to travel.  The young people from my village must travel to Limerick city or Newcastle West to take up a place on a training course.  The cost of taking the only bus from my area to Limerick city five days a week is &euro;55 per week leaving the young person with &euro;45 for the week.  This must be examined.  We heard about the abuse of the free travel pass by people who can afford to travel.  We need to introduce a scheme for those on a jobseeker's allowance of &euro;100 to give them access to transport that will allow them to travel to their courses.<\/p><p>The element of social solidarity has gone on the window.  I question whether it would be better for the Department to give young people a cheque and tell them to get their aeroplane ticket and go.  I urge the Minister to try to see other ways without making these cuts.  I know she is in a very difficult position and her hands are tied, but I cannot agree to these cuts.  I will oppose them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600047#XX00200","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1383758700,"counter":525,"content":"<p>From the opening contribution by Senator Cullinane on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, it seems to me that Sinn F&eacute;in has no faith or belief in and no hope for our young people.  That is deeply regrettable in the context of attempting to pretend to speak on their behalf.  What young person and what parent, aunt, uncle, brother or sister of a young person wants to see an 18 year old heading down to the dole office and being in a state of dependency for an unlimited number of years?<\/p><p>I listened very carefully to Senator Power, who is quite an expert on social welfare, having worked for the previous Minister in this area for a significant number of years.  This is certainly a major change in social welfare policy.  The purpose of the change, and in fairness Senator Mooney alluded to it, is to try to turn something that has become a support or crutch and instead offer support which would be more developmental and positive for the individual.  I appreciate that change is difficult.  On becoming Minister for Social Protection, what amazed me most was the rise in the number of jobless families during the longest boom in Irish history.  At the height of the boom from 2005 to 2007, the numbers of jobless families rose from the European average of being under 10% to 11% to 15%.<\/p> <p>Nobody in Fianna F&aacute;il has ever explained the following to me.  Why did the number of jobless families go totally off the Richter scale at the height of the boom?  A jobless family means that none of the adults has a significant amount of work.  It also means that the outlook for children in those families to subsequently, for instance, do as well as possible and reach their greatest potential, in terms of education and so on, is significantly reduced.  We are now saying to young people that the country will support them but back to work, education and training.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane made a slightly disparaging remark about young people participating in JobBridge.

Would I have liked those young people to get a full-time job straight away and at their first interview?  Of course I would.<\/p><p>I have been involved in the education of Irish students for more than 20 years and as such I have more ambition for them than the Senator or his party seems to have.  He spoke very movingly about the unemployment situation in Waterford and I share his concern.  The people in Waterford come from a long tradition of skilled craftsmen and have made a skilled contribution to the country in a variety of ways.  Waterford experienced a great disaster when Waterford Glass went out of production because there was no guarantee available around 2007.  Given the skills tradition in Waterford we should be ambitious for Waterford.  We should offer the young people in Waterford city and county opportunities in education and training.<\/p><p>My view of the matter differs from the Senator Cullinane's party.  In the North, Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to pay young people of the same age a social welfare payment of &pound;57 which translates roughly into &euro;67 per week.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in has the nerve to come in here and lecture the Government of the South when its party, which has been in the government in the North for more than a decade, has not prioritised young people as far as I am aware.  His party's leadership in the North has gone on a lot of missions to the United States.  However, Sinn F&eacute;in gave nothing like the priority that we give to young people in the South.  I am not saying that we are perfect in the South but we try very hard.  I have supported all efforts in the North to help its young people to secure work.  <\/p><p>Today's provision is a change and I admit that change is difficult.  I understand that people like Senator Cullinane find it difficult to adapt to changing and moving away from a passive system of social welfare that gives somebody a weekly payment without worrying what happens to them afterwards.  That is like a teacher walking into a classroom who sits at the top of the room with folded arms and does not bother to help the people in his or her class to achieve their goals in life.  I realise that such change is difficult for Sinn F&eacute;in.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600048#YY01200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1383759300,"counter":538,"content":"<p>The Minister has a nerve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600048#YY01300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1383759300,"counter":539,"content":"<p>The change is also difficult for some people in Fianna F&aacute;il.  In the long run when we look back, I will be happy.<\/p><p>In the beginning when JobBridge was discussed people felt that few people would avail of the scheme.  The reality is 22,000 people, most of whom are young people, have availed of the opportunity but the scheme is not confined to young people.  The statistics show that about 60% of participants have gone on to secure further significant employment.  Let us remember that when the banks collapsed we lost 250,000 jobs in this country.  In every recession young people are always affected worse than people in the existing labour market because they are new to employment and lack something vital.  They may have excellent education and other qualifications but lack work experience and an employer is likely to prefer a person who has that quality of experience.  Today Senators asked many questions about the number of places on the scheme and where the Government will find the additional money.<\/p><p>I am happy to say, as Minister for Social Protection, that when the Irish Presidency arose I prioritised our aim to get a framework for a youth guarantee in the European Union.  The initiative had not been tried before and negotiations were difficult and demanding but during the course of the Irish Presidency we succeeded in doing so.  I am also happy to say that MEPs from all of the parties in Brussels who are represented in the European Parliament, strongly supported me, including the MEPs from the North, in my attempts to get an agreement on a youth guarantee framework.<\/p><p>Understandably Senators want to know the exact details.  I cannot, at this point in time, tell them all of the exact details for the simple reason the youth guarantee will not be finalised at a European level until the Heads of State meeting at the end of December.  I shall go to France next week with the Taoiseach to have further discussions on the framework of the youth guarantee.  The initiative is not just for Ireland, it is for other European countries even more deeply affected by youth unemployment.  However, I shall read out what we have already agreed.  As I said, the initiative is very much a work in progress and I want Senators to bear that in mind.<\/p><p>First, we are reducing the threshold in terms of the duration of unemployment eligibility for JobsPlus, from 12 months to six months from 1 January.  Employers in Ireland have a critical role to play.  I wish to say to people who have contributed to the debate, particularly Senator Heffernan who has taken a detailed interest in the matter, that employers in other countries play a critical role in providing training and education places for young people.  A critical issue for young people is to find their first job or work experience.  I have sought, across Government, to get social employment clauses into contracts as we invest and re-invest into critical areas of the economy.<\/p><p>From 1 January the JobsPlus scheme will provide &euro;300 per month to an employer who takes on a young person who is more than six months unemployed and on the live register.  That is a very significant wage subsidy.  It is the kind of thing that is done very successfully to promote the employment of young people in countries like Austria where the rate of youth unemployment is very low.  Austria is a small country like Ireland and is the reason I chose it as an example.  Employers in Austria have a very strong sense of social responsibility to young people in their society and want to allow them to participate.<\/p><p>We will have an additional intake of 1,500 young people on the JobBridge scheme.  Again, I shall ask employers to offer to host those places.  There was some conversation here about GAA clubs.  I am happy to say that the GAA has been a strong supporter of the JobBridge scheme and given really important opportunities.  The FAI has been a very good supporter as well.  I was delighted, on a recent visit to FAI headquarters, to meet several people who are graduates of JobBridge and now work in the organisation in full jobs.  That is the kind of progress we all must work together to achieve in order to make that possible for our young people.  <\/p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills is ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for those aged under 25 in the follow-up to Momentum.  That is important because that has been a very successful programme this year for people more than a year unemployed.  It provides training in areas where Senators spoke of vacancies in digital skills and IT.  <\/p><p>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Microfinance Ireland, MFI, and other business start-up schemes.  The total amount involved in that across three Departments is &euro;46 million.  The total amount involved within the Department of Social Protection is &euro;14 million.  The bulk of the funding for programmes for young people will continue to come from domestic Exchequer resources.  Overall, in next year's budget I will be spending an extra &euro;85 million on training and education.<\/p><p>Senators who are concerned about a specific reduction of resources in this particular stream of spending by the Department should know that the spend on the education, the training and the experience budget is doubled, and that is as it should be.  Having worked for a long period of my life with young people, I am astonished to hear tones of no faith in young people from a number of the contributors.  I know that would not be the case if I were speaking to them privately.<\/p><p>Emigration is heart sore, particularly for the mothers, the fathers and the families of the young people who emigrate but even at the height of the boom in Ireland, there was a significant amount of emigration, which to some extent was people looking for wider experience of the world before coming back to Ireland.  I hope that as we rebuild the Irish economy we will draw back the people who left in recent times.<\/p><p>In terms of young people, however, emigration is not the critical factor.  The numbers of young people who are unemployed have fallen from 31% to 28%.  It is also the case that more young people have been staying in education.  Other Senators stated that young qualified people will be going on a relatively low rate of payment but I hope we will find those young graduates who have qualified not going on to any payment but rather going into education and work experience.<\/p><p>The one thing JobBridge has taught me is that we have an astonishing range of incredibly talented young people.  They were fortunate in many ways to have been brought up in the Celtic tiger years and their families have supported them in education and so on.  They are unfortunate in that they have come out of college with master's and primary degrees, and in some cases a PhD, at a time when their targeted employment was no longer available, perhaps because it was in the public sector.  We must put those talents to use and give those young people a chance to become financially independent.<\/p><p>I am happy to say that in the budget the Minister for Education and Skills announced a very significant recruitment campaign for teachers next year and for the first time in a number of years, the Minister for Justice and Equality announced that recruitment to the Garda would recommence.  Everybody knows, whether they are talking about their city or their region, that there is not one solution to unemployment that fits everybody.  There are probably 100 different solutions, pathways and opportunities, and that is what we are seeking to do.<\/p><p>I will not answer the specific question about actors in detail now because I am not equipped to do so but I will make inquiries with the Department and come back to the Senator.  I do not know whether it was in regard to a specific individual or actors in general-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600048#YY01400","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383759900,"counter":541,"content":"<p>It applies to actors in general.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600049#ZZ00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1383759900,"counter":542,"content":"<p>-----but over the years the officials in the Department have been very understanding towards people in the acting profession who were unable to find work.

I know some people will do that.<\/p><p>The first pilot initiative on youth unemployment is under way in Ballymun.  We succeeded in having Ballymun as one of the test points for these new approaches in the European Union.  That started at the beginning of the summer and is under way as we speak.  My colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy John Lyons, has been very involved in that.  That will be an important learning experience for Ireland in terms of the way we bring together the resources in a range of Departments and offer opportunities to young people for whom social welfare dependency and social welfare income is the last resort.  However, what we have to offer first are the education, the training, the experience and the employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600049#ZZ00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1383759900,"counter":543,"content":"<p>A number of Independent Senators, Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, one of the Minister's former colleagues and myself all made the same point.

I have given an outline of where the places are to be.  I think there might be a \"go to\" position to disbelieve that anything in Ireland ever gets better.  That is selling ourselves and the country short.  It is important that we send out a very positive message, particularly where young people are involved.  I have a very strong commitment to young people.  I have been delighted to be involved in creating opportunities for people.  Of course I would prefer if there were pages of advertisements in the newspapers and people could go directly to employment.  However, if young people, regardless of how talented and educated they are, emerge into the workplace after their leaving certificate, a primary degree, masters degree or even a PhD and if during the period of their education and training they have had no opportunity to work, they are at an enormous disadvantage in a very tight jobs market, even a market that is improving.<\/p><p>Employers tend to prefer people who have work experience and very much tend to prefer people who are less than six months on the live register.  Once somebody goes past six months on the live register, even though one's unemployment is not one's fault because one might have lost one's job or never had one in the first place, employers simply do not respond in the same positive way.  In other countries the education systems are built on a dual model with people not just going into third level but also into training, apprenticeships and traineeships.  That is a core element in Austria, a small country like ours but which has very low rates of unemployment, and the employers are full partners in it.<\/p><p>Aside from the cut and thrust of debate on a Bill, I suggest to the Senators that each of them be an ambassador to local employers in the different parts of the country.  Tell them about JobsPlus, JobBridge and the skills conversion courses.  In the case of people who have trained as engineers and have a mathematics background, for example, we will, through the Department of Education and Skills, give them a postgraduate course for a year to convert them to IT.  If it is appropriate we will then give them a JobBridge internship for a few months, after which they can get very valuable employment.  They are being sought for employment.<\/p><p>In this situation we must look to the positives we can promote for our young people.  The biggest barrier to a young person, and I say this with consideration, is to have a prolonged spell on the live register.  It might not be the young person's fault in any way but there is no doubt that if they have a prolonged spell on the live register, it is not a good predictor of them getting a better quality job or even an entry level job, which they could take up to get employment experience and then get into independent employment and become financially independent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600050#AAA01900","speaker":"946"},{"type":"vote","time":1383760500,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 30; N\u00edl, 19.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600050#AAA02000","aye":["1148","1138","1150","1114","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1160","1117","1144","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1162","1132","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1170","1129","1125","1163","1143"],"nay":["1116","1133","1159","1119","1149","1128","1146","1122","1123","1115","1139","1127","1142","1154","1155","1171","1126","1156","1164"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1383761100,"counter":568,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1383761100,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 3 has been ruled out of order because it poses a potential charge on the Exchequer.

Nothing short of deleting that section would satisfy me but, notwithstanding that, we have tabled amendments where we seek to insert a sunrise clause to ensure there is the level of protection about which the Minister spoke.  In the context of her being confident that all the education and training opportunities places will be created and will satisfy the number of young  people who are unemployed and that nobody will have their jobseeker's allowance cut and not have an education or training opportunity place, this amendment and the previous one that was ruled out of order propose that &quot;Prior to the commencement of section 9, the Minister shall submit a report to both Houses of the Oireachtas assessing whether capacity exists within existing activation schemes to cater for all those affected by the section&quot;.  My amendment No. 3 that was ruled out of order referred to 20,000 places because that is the figure from which we are working and the one we received.  I want to repeat those figures again in the context of this amendment.  It proposes that there should not be any cuts unless there is full capacity for education and training places.  If the Minister considers the facts we got from the National Youth Council of Ireland are incorrect, she could give us the correct facts.  The National Youth Council of Ireland's submission states: <blockquote>  We estimate that these... cuts will impact on at least 20,853 young jobseekers in 2014 based on those already on the live register, not taking into the account the new claimants aged 22-25 years from January 2014.  From our analysis of the budget measures, [the] Government is providing an additional 3,250 places in T&uacute;s, Momentum and JobBridge as it is not possible to say how many places will be created on JobsPlus.  <\/blockquote>If the Minister considers that figure is incorrect, she might give us the correct figure but the National Youth Council of Ireland's analysis is that 20,853 young people are being incentivised into a guaranteed extra 3,250 places.<\/p><p>  The analogy of the loaves and fishes was mentioned during a previous discussion on the Bill and that analogy can be used in this context because when I went to school 3,250 and 20,850 simply did not match.  There is a very significant shortfall.  The reason we tabled these amendments is to insert a sunrise clause to protect young people by ensuring that before any of these cuts are imposed and there is a reduction in jobseeker's allowance, which we do not support, those places are provided.  That relates to the Minister's point about having ambition for young people.  Let us make sure we provide the places for them.  That is the core of our argument, namely, that there will not be enough places.  I have explained the thrust and the intent of my amendments and I hope the Minister will be able to consider them and accept them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600051#CCC00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1383761100,"counter":572,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome to the House and it is good to have her here.

I am not saying that I disagree with her reducing social welfare for that younger age group but it is in all our interests to be interested in young people, to be concerned about the brain drain from the country in the form of emigration and to invest in young people.  It would be a terrible slight on the Government if we did not reinvest the money we are very selectively taking from them back into them.

I know this is part of a broader debate but when we quote live register figures in Ireland, we also are citing, as the Minister knows, those who are in part-time work.  That is a pity.  That puts us down as a nation.  There are more opportunities there for young people at a part-time level than are acknowledged in the high figures.<\/p><p>The announcement of &euro;14 million of the youth guarantee funding without a completed plan for the guarantee or a report from the pilot project in Ballymun means that it is unclear what impact the youth guarantee will have for our young people.  The Minister might tell us about the plan she has in that respect.  To cut &euro;32 million from welfare payments without any real plan for the youth guarantee is unacceptable.  It is unequal and could set up young people to fall into the poverty trap.<\/p> <p>It is unclear how training places will be distributed, how effective they will be or how they will match labour market demand.  It is highly questionable to cut social welfare payments without having a real snapshot of training needs.  It could be a premature move.  In this amendment, I am asking the Minister to lay a report before the Oireachtas outlining her plan for those between the ages of 18 and 26.  The people in that group are not homogenous.  They are not all the same.  We need to see a plan that sets out the training opportunities and activation measures that are available for early school leavers, those who have finished the leaving certificate, graduates and postgraduates.  That entire cohort fills the eight-year gap to which I refer.<\/p><p>I would like to mention an issue of concern for those of us who are worried about mental health issues.  Some young lads and girls do not get on with their families.  Many young people cannot rely on family supports to get by.  They are being asked to cover their rent, transport, food and general living costs from a weekly payment of &euro;100.  There could be a threat that serious issues such as homelessness will get worse as a result of this measure.  We need to be particularly concerned about cases in which there are mental health issues.  Can the Minister track these people?  Is she working with the HSE in this area?  I am hoping to get answers to the many questions I have asked.  Young people who are out there on their own might find it hard to meet their accommodation, food and transport costs, etc., following the cut from &euro;188 to &euro;100 a week.  If they have mental health issues, we could be risking making them homeless.  This is a very serious issue.<\/p><p>Many highly skilled and qualified graduates who have been unable to find work here following the completion of their degrees have been forced to emigrate.  What activation and education measures are being offered to those who are still here?  They are already highly skilled.  What will the youth guarantee specifically do for them?  Labour market activation does not start with cuts to basic low-level social welfare payments.  People in this demographic group will receive &euro;88 less than people over the age of 26.  Separation based purely on age is not a plan.  Labour market activation comes from real learning opportunities.  It should reflect labour market needs and demands.  Job creation must be a priority in that context.  Essentially, the Minister needs to examine this eight-year age group.  Specific measures are required to assist early school leavers, those who have finished the leaving certificate, graduates and postgraduates.  What is the overall plan for that group?<\/p><p>I accept that the Government is serious about incentivising work and supporting training and education among our young people, but that does not mean it is doing the right things.  At a very minimum, it must give a commitment to use the &euro;32 million that will be saved as a result of these cuts for investment in the youth guarantee, among other measures.  The current level of such investment stands at less than half of that amount.  I hope my proposal will receive support across the House.  I will not push it to a vote this evening, but I will consider doing so on Report Stage.  If the Minister gives a commitment to ensuring a plan will be laid before the House to address those issues, there will be no division on this issue.  We need to set targets.  There is no question about the Government's good intentions, but that does not mean it is doing the right thing.  If we are to do the right thing, we must focus on the needs of this age group and on how to move them towards work today and into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600051#CCC01200","speaker":"1131","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383761700,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I remind Senator Harte to speak to the amendments.

In any event, our apprenticeship structures were largely for young men.  The only apprenticeships of interest to young women, by and large, related to hairdressing.  The first element of this plan will involve the development by Ireland of a dual model that will give equal respect to the third-level academic route and to the vocational-based apprenticeship and traineeship route.  The second element of it will involve the promotion of internships.  The third element of it will involve the promotion of intra-EU labour mobility.<\/p><p>The approach that is being taken will engage the European employment service, EURES, and will involve the targeted use of employment subsidies - the JobsPlus scheme is an example of such a subsidy - and the development of youth entrepreneurship supports.  As I said earlier, approximately &euro;2.5 million will be made available through the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in that respect.  Business processes in public employment services throughout Europe will be reviewed and redesigned.  Closer links between the training agencies of public employment services and employers will be developed across the EU.<\/p><p>The Senator asked how we will know what young people of different classes, categories and ages need, given that many of them are at different levels.  There is a big difference between an 18 year old and a 25 year old in terms of experience and maturity, etc.<\/p> <p>We have been rolling out the Intreo system since I became Minister.  Members may have seen the conversion of some of the offices and may have seen the office in Loughrea.  When somebody of any age comes to the new offices, we profile them not just in the traditional way of name, address and PPS number but, more importantly, in terms of education, different education and experience attainments, what they previously worked at, what they previously earned, where they worked and what kind of jobs did they hold and for how long.  We worked on this with the ESRI and can, therefore, make a prediction of exit from the live register.  <\/p><p> I spoke with the Senator's colleagues earlier about what we have started to do so far.  Ireland won one of the first model schemes in respect of young people in Ballymun entitled <i>youngballymun<\/i>.  People from that project were in the D&aacute;il today briefing other colleagues in the Oireachtas as well as the head of activation in the Department of Social Protection, assistant secretary, Mr. John McKeown.  He appeared before the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection today and gave a very detailed handout setting out the composition.  I will endeavour to get a copy of his handout and PowerPoint presentation tomorrow.  We anticipate that about 14,000 young people will be affected by the changes we are discussing and that a cache of 20,000 places will be available next year.  Do we have all the details finalised at this stage?  Not absolutely.  We know exactly where we want to go and the resources that are commanded.  I assure Senators that the &euro;32 million in savings will be spent many times over on activation, employment, work experience and so on.  <\/p><p> We have been trying to learn from countries that have been successful in tackling youth unemployment.  Two things are critical.  Not everybody wants to go to college.  Lots of people want to do practically oriented courses that are heavily linked from day 1 to employment.  We have been talking to people like Fast Into Technology, FIT, to develop appropriate courses with our institutes of technology which would give associate professional status in different fields to young people.  That will be a new development in Ireland and I am hopeful we will move to progress that.  We have already started the Momentum courses this year and will have more of them.  <\/p><p> We have a very exciting and demanding programme for everybody involved - civil servants and educators and trainers.  We have already done a remarkable conversion of the Department of Social Protection from being a passive payer of benefits to a more active public employment service.  That is the road we intend to go down and I would be more than happy to take up the invitation proffered by Senators Moloney, van Turnhout and Bacik and others to come back to the Seanad at an appropriate stage and debate it in detail.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600052#DDD01500","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383762300,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I heard the Minister say that the &euro;32 million in savings will be spent many times over.

Our education system over-emphasises the academic stream.  As a result, people look to be doctors, nurses or teachers.  They are not multipliers.  They are not entrepreneurs.  They are not going to be job creators when the high status goes to those looking for a job on their own or in the public service.

I have undertaken to come back at that stage and will be more than happy to do so.  I want to be clear that I am not in a position to provide a detailed committed report now because we in negotiations.  We have ambitions to provide many extra places and to draw down the maximum amount of funding per annum from Europe, which would be roughly &euro;32 million, but we must reach agreement with the Commission and our European partners.  That is certainly our hope but I will come back and tell the House what we have been doing.<\/p><p>As the Senator noted, we have developed the Momentum programme very successfully with the Department of Education and Science.

It is employers in Ireland who we hope will offer experience, places, jobs and short-term places.  <\/p><p>In respect of the Senator's question about part-time work, the live register for October fell to 396,000, of whom about 80,000 are in part-time work or signing for credits.<\/p> <p>That is the rough proportion that is continuously on the live register.

The Senator referred to young people with a disability or serious medical condition - whether that is a mental or physical health issue - who would, generally speaking, be on some kind of disability payment.  These arrangements do not apply to such young people; they are paid at the full rate.  We have special arrangements in the Department to assist young people who have been in care and are leaving care.  As with young people on a disability, they get a full rate.  I wished to clarify that point because the Senator seemed to imply a certain level of doubt about it.

Did her initiative last year, which required people to have worked for one year with the bank, lead to a collapse in applications?  I would certainly have expected them to have reduced, but I do not know.  I can see the logic behind not giving hard-pressed taxpayers' money to the banks by removing mortgage interest supplement.  There is logic in not giving such support to the banks.  However, I cannot see the logic when the Government is not proposing anything instead.  This is not part of some grand strategy to help people in mortgage arrears; it is simply a budgeting and accounting exercise.  As I said at the outset, I accept there are cuts the Government must make and all we are asking is that they be as fair as possible.  This cut is particularly unfair.<\/p><p>Last week when we met representatives of the troika, they said - I am sure they told the other groups, including Sinn F&eacute;in, Independents, and Labour Party and Fine Gael backbenchers who met them - they were very unhappy with the Government's progress in sorting out the problem of people in mortgage arrears.  However, the Government line is always that it is doing a considerable amount, but what it has offered effectively is bankruptcy, personal insolvency and letters from banks informing people to sell their houses.  That is what the answer has been instead of this.  Had this section been part of some grand strategy where the balance of power was weighted in favour of the person in trouble, I would probably support it and say it was a reasonable proposition in the context of an overall strategy to help people in arrears.  However, it is unreasonable to disconnect completely a support such as this, which is keeping people in their homes, particularly those on interest-only arrangements able to make repayments, without offering something else.<\/p><p>The result of the provisions in this section and other actions the Government is taking is that people are getting letters asking them to sell their houses.  Last March the Government and the Central Bank announced targets for the banks to create sustainable solutions for mortgages.  It turns out that a large percentage of those sustainable solutions are legal threats or letters asking people to sell their houses.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme is non-existent.  Split mortgages are available to some people but not available to others and absolutely no criteria are set out.  It is wrong to make this change when not enough is being done for people who are in trouble.<\/p><p>While I do not have the exact wording before me, when the budget was announced I believe this was described as the winding down of the scheme over four years.  The legislation does not specify that and merely states that the scheme will end and will not be payable after 1 January 2018.  However, what does it mean for people currently in receipt of mortgage interest supplement?  Will they be told they will no longer get it outside of the normal times when they might be told that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600055#JJJ00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1383763500,"counter":619,"content":"<p>As the previous Senator said, section 11 of the Bill phases out mortgage interest supplement - effectively abolishing it.  Mortgage interest supplement is being abolished in the absence of effective action to tackle the mortgage arrears crisis.  Last year's budget had an announcement about mortgage interest supplement which we regarded as disingenuous.  Last year the Minister introduced a rule preventing people from accessing mortgage interest supplement for 12 months.  For many struggling families this scheme offered a glimmer of light at the end of a year-long tunnel.  However, now, just ten months later, the Government is about to extinguish that light altogether.  The scheme is being abolished in the absence of any other income support for homeowners who may lose their jobs.<\/p><p>I listened to the responses the Minister gave in the D&aacute;il in respect of similar amendments that were tabled there.  The Government's policy rationale for abolishing the scheme is that it was always intended to be a short-term support.  It is possible to argue, for example, that the rent-supplement scheme was intended to be a short-term support.  Will that be up for the chop next?  Will we get rid of rent supplement because it was seen as a short-term measure?  Many of these schemes, when initially introduced, may be designed to be short-term measures, but become necessary in the long term because no other measure has been put in place.  The logic for introducing something as a short-term support is that it is being done while coming up with something more helpful for those people who find themselves in mortgage distress.<\/p><p>Based on many of the responses the Minister has given on this issue, the Government seems to be pinning many of its hopes on the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  People come to my office every week with letters from their banks asking them to sell their homes.  They are trying to keep the family home and are doing their best to pay some of the mortgage.  They want to explore options such as mortgage-to-rent, split mortgages or the range of options the Government claims exist.  However, for the most part, the banks will not entertain it.  Very small percentages of people are being given the opportunity to take up the mortgage-to-rent scheme but the vast majority are not.<\/p><p>A couple with one child living in a three-bedroom house cannot go into the mortgage-to-rent scheme because of issues with over-letting.  There are many anomalies.  The ultimate problem with any of these schemes on which the Government seems to be pinning its hopes, is that the banks effectively have a veto and many of the banks simply will not entertain mortgage to rent and many of the other so-called measures.<\/p><p>Like Senator Byrne, I am opposing this section, primarily because it is wrong and also because no alternative is being introduced.  There is no joined-up plan offering a real solution to people in mortgage distress.  Along with the troika, many organisations and economists are also saying the Government needs to get its act together on helping people in mortgage distress and finding it difficult to pay their mortgages.  We need a real solution that is durable and helpful to people in such distress, but that is not the case at the moment.  In that context to effectively abolish the mortgage interest supplement is unhelpful and will make matters worse for people who are in what is often a very desperate situation.  I oppose this section for those reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600055#JJJ00400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1383763500,"counter":620,"content":"<p>We already dealt with this matter in some detail on Second Stage and I know the Minister made some responses that were very specific and which I am sure she will repeat again on Committee State.  Nonetheless as Senators Cullinane and Byrne have done, it is important that we record our opposition to this proposal.<\/p><p>  The submission on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill by FLAC and the Northside Community Law Centre stated: &quot;What is particularly disappointing is that this is being done when there is no evidence, let alone any guarantee that banks are positively encouraging solutions that will keep people in their own homes.&quot;  On Second Stage I said I was concerned that the banks ultimately have a veto.  In the Personal Insolvency Act and every other piece of legislation the Government effectively caved in to the banks.  The Government can put whatever spin it likes on it, but the banks rule, okay.  They will rule even more now that a number of other banks have pulled out of the Irish market.<\/p><p>  The FLAC and the Northside Community Law Centre submission stated: &quot;The initial justification for reducing MIS was that it was only going to banks.&quot;  This is something the Minister has repeatedly said and one has great sympathy with that situation.  I would be completely <i>ad idem<\/i> with her on that; why should the banks be gaining at the expense of the taxpayer in the current economic climate?  The submission continued:<blockquote>However, that was not its purpose.  It was and remains an important housing support.  If MIS is lost, then people may not be able to support their mortgage, leading to unsustainable mortgages and ultimate repossession with the risk of further costs to the state in rent supplement and social housing costs.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>Let us consider the change in the law during the past 12 months.  It will now allow more repossessions.  When we tie that in with this proposal, one might question whether there is an unstated Government policy to allow a rush of repossessions.  I genuinely hope that will not be the result of this proposal.<\/p><p>I echo a point made by the Free Legal Advice Centres organisation and I endorse what FLAC and the Northside Community Law Centre have stated.  The FLAC recommendation is that &quot;Mortgage Interest Supplement be retained at least until the Central Bank can produce satisfactory evidence that lenders have sustainable strategies to maintain people in their homes without the need for the supplement.&quot;  Whether the banks will do that is a moot question.  Thus far, the evidence suggests they are more concerned about going after repossessions especially in a rising housing market in the Dublin and Leinster area.  I am rather concerned about this and I hope the Minister will address that and the other issues that have been outlined by my colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600055#JJJ00500","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383764100,"counter":622,"content":"<p>As Senator Mooney noted, we had a detailed discussion on this yesterday.  Since the bank crash in 2008 the Department has spent &euro;319 million on the payment.  Reference has been made to other solutions.  I only wish that some of that had gone on mortgage-to-rent solutions.  I gave some examples yesterday.  Essentially, we have ended up in some cases paying between &euro;50,000 to &euro;66,000 of interest on behalf of people.  That is interest for the banks, it does not go to the individuals.  To be honest, the poor families involved have ended up in no better state and have exhausted five or six years on interest-only payments paid for by the Department.  With the advent of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the mortgage arrears process and the development - slowly, I acknowledge - of other solutions such as mortgage-to-rent, there are alternatives.

There is no doubt that people who are struggling to pay their mortgages will also suffer.  Senator Mooney referred to the FLAC submission made to all of us.  I will quote from that report because it was a very good submission.  The submission reminds all of us that the programme for Government for 2011 to 2016 referred to \"Making greater use of Mortgage Interest Supplement to support families who cannot meet their mortgage payments, which is a better and cheaper option than paying rent supplement after a family loses their home\".  That makes sense.  The submission went on to suggest that the proposal to close the scheme to new applicants from the beginning of January 2014 and to abolish it entirely by 2018 would remove what is an essential housing support which has been part of the safety net in our social welfare code for when people become ill or unemployed.  The submission also suggested there is no evidence that banks are positively encouraging solutions that will keep people in their own homes.  These are all points from the FLAC submission.<\/p><p>A recent Oireachtas committee hearing invited in the leaders of the main banks.  I am referring to the pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, as well as Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.  What came into the public domain following that meeting was that the banks had sent out, between them, 14,721 repossession letters and 2,439 requests for voluntary surrender.  So much for the banks helping people who are in mortgage distress.  One of the most galling aspects of this and the banks' appearance before the committee was that they included sending out what many would see as threatening letters of repossession as solutions.  This was the banks' solution.<\/p><p>As the Minister is aware, the Central Bank has set a target of 20% of offers to be made by banks to mortgage holders in arrears of over 90 days.  The banks are suggesting that sending these letters, which seems to be happening in the vast majority of cases, represents a solution, but it is not a solution for most families.  A number of families I dealt with, who are in arrears of approximately &euro;5,000 at most, received letters from the bank suggesting the family should sell up.  The only reason was because they were among the few who were not in negative equity.  The bank took the view that it could force these people to sell up and then it would get its money back.  There are also situations where people are in negative equity and the bank are asking them to sell up.  This makes no sense because the bank will take a hit.  The bank will take a hit anyway but if the person loses the home, the bank still takes a hit.<\/p><p>I have no wish to stray from the amendments because I realise we are dealing specifically with the mortgage interest supplement, but we cannot see it in isolation from the wider need for a real sustainable solution to help people who are in mortgage distress.  Nothing the Minister said in her response - I mean this genuinely - has given me any hope that this will change.  This is a short-sighted solution and my view is shared by FLAC and other organisations as well.<\/p><p>The Minister's response was unsatisfactory.  It was disappointing for those who were genuinely hopeful that the Government would put in place better solutions rather than abolishing supports already in place.  I do not see much hope of that following the Minister's response to our contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600056#KKK00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1383764100,"counter":624,"content":"<p>Does the Minister agree that for this proposal to be effective and not seen simply as a cost saving exercise, the solution lies with the banks?

Are these homes now under threat or at risk?  Perhaps the Minister already has clarified this for Members but I am acutely conscious that &euro;55 million is a lot in interest.  The average mortgage might be three times more in terms of capital and if one looks at it from that perspective, &euro;55 million in mortgage interest payments could be the equivalent of &euro;200 million in mortgages.

Professor Honohan appeared before the aforementioned joint committee, as did all the banks.  As for using the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, as an instrument, not a single bank itemised how many people were at the communication stage, the assessment stage, the resolution stage or the appeal stage.  Although an instrument is available, it is not being used as a tool to manage and measure.  Members are aware of what this country went through with the banks.  They know what happened when Mr. Neary did not regulate.  As an instrument now is available, why is it not being used to put the screws on the banks?  As for letting the banks off the hook completely by allowing them simply to send out letters, that is not a measurement tool and is inadequate.  While that farce is under way on one hand, on the other hand mortgage interest supplement is being phased out.  I can see the homeowner losing out in this regard and consequently, I want to see this joined up and tied up in such a way that our priority as a nation is to assist people to stay in and to hold on to their homes.

My point to Members is this money is simply going straight to the banks and what is needed is resolution.  When one has a bank crash on the scale experienced in Ireland, one needs a resolution of the loans and the Government, as did the previous Administration supported by Senator Byrne, advised by the Cooney report and subsequently the Keane report, has proposed a mortgage arrears resolution process.  I am not aware of any country that has experienced such a bank crash involving properties or of individual states within the United States - where property crashes happen quite frequently - in which there has not been a resolution process.  This essentially is what the Government is doing, while recognising the particular situation in which the people involved here find themselves.

I acknowledge the resolution processes have been slow in getting under way but they are now under way.  Resolutions must take place and the object of the resolution process is to help to keep families in their homes, that is, in ordinary residential family homes.  I am highly confident that this will happen.  It is a new process for Ireland because thankfully, we never have had this kind of bank crash previously in our history.  However, the process has started and as Senator Healy Eames noted in respect of Professor Honohan, he is pushing the banks.  Moreover, as Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan is independent in the performance of his duty and has a seat on the governing board of the European Central Bank.  As for what the troika is suggesting we do when it asks for more activity, I am afraid it actually is asking for a faster resolution process.  The approach in Ireland has been to work out all the different elements of the issue and then to go at it.  My hope is that over the four years during which the supplement will be phased out, more funding will be put in, for instance, to the alternative solutions such as mortgage to rent and other solutions with which the local authorities are assisting because at present, the Government is merely sending money straight to the banks.  I can give Members chapter and verse on how this is not particularly assisting people who unfortunately are in this position.

People who have lost employment are finding it very difficult to pay off mortgages they may have taken out at the height of the boom.  In essence, that is the problem.  The Senator asked if there was a resolution process from the banks for the Department of Social Protection.  No, there is not.  We pay all this money and we do not even get a better deal in return for the people.  That is probably one of the most aggravating features of the entire arrangement.  At the end of the five or seven years of paying &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000, &euro;60,000 of interest on behalf of the people who have lost their jobs and lost their business, they end up with a higher level of bank debt.  That is not helping to solve their problem.  Certainly it is helping to solve the banks' problems because they are getting a very large cashflow of money without having to give anything in return.  At the same time the families involved are essentially heavily restricted in their capacity to go back to work.  These are people who set out, probably full of confidence like everybody else, to buy their homes.  They were obviously in work or in business in the context of buying their homes and now they have become parked in many cases on social welfare.  The critical issue as the economy recovers is that people who became homeowners and who had a business and were active in employment should be encouraged back to work in order that they can get to financial independence.  The mortgage arrears resolution process is under way.  If a person has the type of difficulty to which the Senator referred where he or she loses a job temporarily, MARP is in place.  That means there has to be an engagement between the lender and the individual.<\/p><p>If a person loses his or her job temporarily, the downside of the mortgage interest supplement is that it almost becomes a locked-in position, a chicken and egg situation, whereby to continue getting the mortgage interest supplement one cannot go back to work.  We are trying to move to a model where local authorities and other institutions have, for example, mortgage to rent supplement where, ultimately, I would hope many of those people, if they wish, would be in a position to buy back their home.  It is a variation on a low rise mortgage and they would come into ownership of the home again as is done in many countries.  While &euro;319 million is going to the banks they are not doing very much for the families in distress who have lost their job and are unable to pay their interest.

In that instance the person will only get credited contributions, not paid contributions.  There is a big difference between the two contributions.  Somebody could end up not having enough paid contributions.  The Minister is right to say that the money can be recovered but credited contributions are not good enough for the person who finds him or herself with insufficient contributions.<\/p><p>As the Minister knows, we have increased to 520 the number of contributions necessary to qualify for a contributory pension.  We will end up in a situation where a person who is involved in an accident, through no fault of their own, will not have enough paid contributions.  There is a massive difference between credited and paid contributions.  A person without the proper entitlement will not receive a contributory pension, which is unfair.  Our amendments will allow the Minister to reclaim the money from the compensator but have it classed as paid contributions rather than credited contributions.  If the Minister does not accept the amendment, it will lead to problems in the future and people will find themselves in such a situation.<\/p><p>I do not know whether the matter has been examined by the officials but I know that the Minister may not be able to accept my amendment.  I will not press my amendment.  I will withdraw it and resubmit it on Report Stage.  I ask the Minister to consult her officials on the matter and ensure this will not happen.  I do not want such individuals to be disadvantaged through no fault of their own.  I am sure the Minister does not intend for that to happen either but the anomaly must be addressed in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600060#OOO00400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1383766200,"counter":656,"content":"<p>The proposals follow recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission and closely follow the scheme in the UK and Northern Ireland.

As she knows, an injured party can bring a case to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the insurance company will also be represented, or the employer or whoever the compensator will be.  At a certain point in the process the PIAB must see a certificate supplied by the Department that states the income given to the person, which makes sense.  It could be an illness benefit or disability payment.  The PIAB then uses the figure to reduce the amount of money the compensator must pay to the injured person, which also makes sense.  The compensator must pay that figure to the Department.<\/p><p>Where a subsequent error comes to light, the Department must repay the money to the compensator.  Let us say the  Department claims a person has been paid &euro;1,000 but, due to a mistake, he or she was only paid &euro;500 and the money was paid back to the compensator.  That could lead to problems if the company, for example, goes into liquidation with the result that the person must wait in line with other creditors to get the money back.  There is no reason for the money to go back to the compensator.  We have called for the money to go directly back to the injured person because it makes sense.<\/p> <p>That is what the amendment, which I know is out of order, sought to do.

Under section 59B(2)(a) of the Pensions Act 1990, where the rules of the scheme permit, trustees can reduce the benefit paid to a pensioner once another pension becomes payable and when they become entitled to a full rate of State pension in circumstances where they are entitled to less than a full rate beforehand.  Section 18 gives pension scheme trustees a discretionary power to change the rules of a scheme to allow for the reduction of benefits paid to people from the age of 65 as if the State pension were payable to them even when it is not.  In essence, while scheme trustees can, at their discretion, fund additionality, having an occupational pension from 65 years will not guarantee protection from the impact of the Government's previous decision to raise the State pension age to 66 in 2014, 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  We see that first as part of a series of erosion of retirement income safeguards for older people.  We are talking about integrated pensions and I want to ask the Minister a question by outlining a hypothetical situation, which is the best way I can explain my concern.<\/p><p>Would I be correct in saying that there could be people who would have expected to receive an income from the age of 65 of, say, &euro;400, &euro;230 of which is made up from their State pension and &euro;170 from a scheme?  Would I be correct in saying that following the enactment of this Bill, that person will not receive the State pension but only the &euro;170 from their scheme?  There might be an expectancy on their part that they will receive &euro;400 once they reach the age of 65 but because the pension is increased to 66, they will not get that.<\/p> <p>For one year they will get &euro;170 under the scheme.

The State pension transition facility was abolished and changes were made to jobseeker's benefit.  I would like to clarify that somebody who seeks this benefit at the age of 65 or later will be paid until his or her 66th birthday when he or she qualifies for the State pension.  In 2021 and 2028, further proposed changes to the State pension age will presumably be addressed then.<\/p><p>As Senator Moloney pointed out, I changed by way of circular prior to the debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il the arrangements relating to people who are 62 or older and who may be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance such that they will simply be required to register with the Department once a year in respect of the allowance or jobseeker's benefit.  That will be a significant assistance to people.  There will be no penalties relating to activation but, on the other hand, if they wish to take part in activation measures that are available, for example, CE or T&uacute;s schemes and so on, it will be open to them.  If somebody of that age has been doing outdoor work and is unlikely to find similar work or does not want to find it and is in effect retiring via the jobseeker's payments at a slightly earlier age, he or she will only be required to register once a year.  That will give a much better option to such older people but given many of them want to continue working, in some cases into their 70s, the option to engage in activation measures will be available to them.  There will not be a break in the payment of jobseeker's benefit between an individual's 65th and 66th birthday when he or she qualifies for the State pension.<\/p><p>This is a technical amendment designed to address a scenario where scheme rules state a specific age of 65 rather than normal pensionable age.  These provisions do not affect the rate of occupational pension promised.  Before schemes operated off the State pension being payable from age 65.  This amendment is simply intended to ensure this continues to be the case and members continue to receive the benefits they have been promised.  Organisations such as the ISCP are concerned about defined benefit pensions schemes.  The difficulties with these schemes, unfortunately, largely relate to investments in banks and so on and to the turmoil on the international financial markets rather than to regulation of pensions by the previous or current Government.  The trustees should organise the pension fund in the way that is most provident in terms of the members but also in terms of the promise the fund has made to the employees and whether in practice that is realisable.  We are addressing many of those issues currently through the reinstatement of the funding standard and the regulator is working with many schemes to ensure the viability of the maximum number of schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600062#QQQ00600","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1383767400,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Last year, I commented on this issue during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill in the context of the number of people who are on contract and who are obliged to stop working at 65 years of age.

The Minister stated this falls under the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and we must examine contract law.  Companies should consider changing contracts to allow people to continue to work if they want.

There is a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i> here in that I asked a similar question, with the tolerance of the Chair, on 24 April.  I hope the Minister has some good news to convey tonight, as opposed to his having merely been handed a hospital pass, so to speak, in deputising for the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.<\/p><p>  I am seeking a commitment from the Government to the community nursing home sector, which is vital to ensure a balanced provision of care for our elderly citizens.  The private nursing home sector, while it does provide an important service, cannot meet the demand arising out of a growing population of ageing citizens.  Moreover, the private sector cannot cater for elderly people who require more extensive care, such as those suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease.<\/p><p>  I was assured last April that a decision would be announced &quot;shortly&quot; and &quot;soon&quot; in terms of a future commitment by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive to community nursing homes, including the Abbeyleix and Shaen facilities in County Laois.  The latter is the only unit within the entire region which caters for high-dependency patients.  The Minister will understand that, at this stage, patience is wearing thin among people in Laois.  The initial announcement by the HSE to close the Abbeyleix and Shaen community nursing homes was made two years ago this week.  To be fair, the Minister for Health did intervene and ask the HSE to review the decision and compile a report.  That report was furnished a year later.  Twelve months  later, we are still anxiously awaiting a commitment from the Department of Health and the HSE to retain both Abbeyleix and Shaen.  These particular facilities are typical of community nursing homes throughout the country, all of which are absolutely vital to ensuring that elderly citizens in need of residential care in the autumn of their years are cared for properly.<\/p><p>  It is an absurd situation that only 16 patients remain in Abbeyleix community nursing home even though it has the capacity and scope to cater for up to 50.  That makes no economic sense.  I do not understand the HSE's strategy in this matter; nor do I support its policy in seeking to drive people into private nursing homes.  It is not an acceptable position.  Community tolerance is wearing thin after two years of waiting for a decision, which is understandable.  It is high time we received a commitment, in no uncertain terms, to the community nursing home sector.  These facilities provide a level of care and service that is central to our strategy of caring for citizens in the autumn of their years.

I thank Senator John Whelan for raising the issue.  Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate quality long-term residential care.<\/p><p>Access to appropriate quality long-term residential care is underpinned by both the system of registration and inspection of nursing homes and the financial support available under the nursing homes support scheme.  Essentially, our aim is to ensure that people are being cared for at the point of lowest complexity.  People should only be entering long-term nursing home care when they have passed the point of being able to be cared for at home.  This means that only the most highly dependent people should be in long-term nursing home care.  One of our key priorities is the progression of a single assessment tool for older people.  This standardised framework will ensure there is a robust, equitable standardised care needs assessment framework nationally.  It will also allow resources to be targeted towards those with the greatest needs and enable supports and services to be designed in the most appropriate way possible.<\/p><p>The Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive to develop an overall plan regarding future public provision of long-stay residential care services.  The plan will reflect both national and regional requirements and will have regard to the current severe financial constraints, restrictions on public sector staffing and recruitment, and the ongoing need to meet service and safety standards, all of which pose challenges for community nursing units across the country.  The review of the nursing homes support scheme will also influence the future direction of residential care services.  This review will consider the long-term sustainability of the scheme, as well as examining community-based services and how further development of those services might viably allow more older people to stay at home for longer.  Work on the review is ongoing and is expected to be completed in early 2014.  A longer-term plan for public residential facilities will follow on from that.<\/p><p>There are six public nursing units in counties Laois and Offaly providing 285 residential beds, of which 249 are long-term residential care beds and the remaining 36 are short-term beds.  All six units were registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority in 2012 for a period of three years.  In recent times, the future of St. Brigid's Hospital, Shaen, and Abbeyleix District Hospital have been under consideration by the HSE.  Following a public consultation process carried out in 2012, all relevant information and submissions were presented to the designated officer on 16 August 2012.  He, in turn, made a submission to the Department in December 2012, following consideration of which the Department sought clarification on a number of points.  The HSE's response to that request for clarification is still awaited.  The Department will finalise a submission for the Minister's consideration once the HSE has resolved any outstanding issues.  This process is expected to conclude shortly.  These decisions are being made in the context of the HSE's service plan for 2014, which will be published in draft form in the coming weeks for implementation in January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600063#SSS00700","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1383768600,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the information he has put on the record of the House.

I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for being present.  This is an issue that has an impact countrywide and I wish to highlight one example.  I am talking about municipal authorities, in effect, town councils, that own land and property which in many cases is very much associated with a specific town.  In Kells, County Meath, between 300 and 350 acres of land is owned by the town council.  It is widely considered by the people to be held in trust for the people of the town of Kells.  The land incorporates the people's park at Lloyd, hundreds of acres of agricultural land, and Kells business park.  Over the years, businesses were attracted to the town through its ownership of this land.  I believe more than 1,000 people are employed in that part of the town.  There is great affection in the town of Kells for this land.  It was originally bequeathed to the town from the Headfort estate.<\/p><p>As I understand from the Local Government Bill 2013, the land that town councils own, such as the lands in Lloyd in Kells, will be transferred to the county council which will have the reserved function of selling it, a function currently reserved for the town council.  There are nine town councillors in Kells with a say on this and they are accountable to the people of Kells, but under the Minister's plans, the Kells municipal authority, which covers a much greater area than the town, will have seven members out of a total of 40.  The fear is that this land could be sold from under the feet of the people of Kells by a vote of councillors predominantly from other areas.  It is a significant asset and worth a substantial amount of money, but I do not think the people of Kells are interested in the money.  They are interested in maintaining it and achieving a positive solution to it, but I do not think that positive solution is to give the power of sale to the county council.<\/p><p>I have spoken to my colleagues who are members of Kells Town Council - Councillors Bryan Reilly, Sean Drew and Frankie Lynch - as well as members of my party cumann, and they are very concerned about this.  I have also spoken to senior officials in Meath County Council and they have concerns as well.  They would like to see something done.  Some proposals have been put forward, such as putting the land into some type of trust arrangement.  There are complications with that, but anything other than financial issues can be overcome.  It might be an option to transfer it to the county council in advance of the legislation, but there may be stamp duty issues with that.  I do not know if the Minister can provide any comfort on this.  I call on him to liaise with the council, the councillors and the people of Kells to ensure this land is protected and not simply handed over to the county council, because it is a valuable asset.  Some kind of trust or other protection needs to be put in place in conjunction with the Department and the local authorities.  This issue has not arisen much yet, but I am sure there are other examples of municipally held land over which people do not wish to see councillors from another end of a large county having the power of sale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600064#TTT00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1383768600,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this matter and I am pleased to have the opportunity to provide some policy context and detail in relation to the legislative provisions proposed regarding matters such as these.  The issue of local government reform at sub-county level was raised on the Adjournment in the House last month, and while I do not propose to revisit the contributions of Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, from that occasion, I will make a few comments on the broader policy context of the specific issue raised.<\/p><p>  The Government's action programme for effective local government, published in October 2012, sets out the Government decision for a range of measures to reform and strengthen local government structures, functions, funding, governance and operational arrangements.  Chapter 6 of the action programme sets out policy decisions to replace town councils with a new comprehensive model of municipal governance, based around principal towns and designed to strengthen local government within counties and to address weaknesses and anomalies in the current system.  Without question, this is a radical departure, and the decision to change fundamentally our approach to local government arrangements within counties was not taken lightly.<\/p><p>  There has been a considerable element of history, heritage and civic status associated with town authorities, but these strengths cannot hide the fact that the existing system of town local government contains glaring weaknesses, including limited functions, outdated boundaries, duplication of administration and insufficient scale to maximise efficiency or support expertise or resources to carry out a range of complex functions.<\/p><p>  The new model of municipal governance will address these and other limitations.  Equally, there is no reason the strengths and qualities associated with many town councils cannot be extended beyond the town walls, as it were, to embrace the wider hinterland of towns which are linked to them for a range of social, commercial, educational, employment and other purposes.  Municipal districts will cover the entire territory of each county, reflecting European norms, removing outdated boundaries and ending the anomaly of small towns having municipal status and dual representation, while some larger centres and rural areas lack any sub-county governance.  The performance of different functions by members at county and district levels will result in greater effectiveness than the current parallel town and county system.  The division of functions between county and district levels will be determined on the basis of what is most relevant to each level.  Local matters will be dealt with at municipal district level, while those of wider strategic application will be decided at county level.<\/p><p>  Invariably during any period of change, specific instances will arise that have to be managed as part of the change process, and I am aware of the lands around the Spire of Lloyd in Kells, County Meath, and the importance attached to them locally as a recreational asset.  The status of such assets under the Local Government Bill 2013, which I published recently, and following implementation of the structural reform measures, is clear.  In accordance with section 24(2) of the Bill, the local authority for a county will become the successor authority for all purposes where a town council is dissolved.  In addition, consequential on the dissolution of town councils, there are extensive provisions in Schedule 4 to the Bill which will apply from the date of dissolution in respect of a range of matters.  Paragraph 2 of Schedule 4 deals with the transfer of assets from a dissolved authority to a successor authority and provides, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that all assets which were vested in or belonged to an authority to be dissolved will from the relevant day or date be transferred to the successor authority.<\/p><p>  The bottom line is that these lands will continue to be an amenity available to and enjoyed by the people of Kells and of the wider hinterland.  After mid-2014, operational responsibility for the land will rest with Meath County Council, but stewardship will rest in the first instance with the elected members for the Kells municipal district who, under the new legislation, will have a strong portfolio of reserved functions to be performed in that district - much stronger than county councillors currently have at area level - including functions in respect of budgetary procedures and decisions on programmes of works within the district.<\/p> <p> To conclude, I will refer back briefly to the overall local government reform programme by reminding Members that the core purpose of the programme is to put local government in a position to deliver better services, amenities and governance to their communities by strengthening the structures, finances and operations generally of the system.  In the context of future governance arrangements within counties, the principle of strength through unity will be a key factor in ensuring that these objectives are delivered to the benefit of all communities, urban and rural.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600064#TTT00400","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383769200,"counter":706,"content":"<p>I am disappointed with the response.  I did not table this matter to attack the Minister's local government strategy but to raise a specific problem that has arisen as a result of it.  That problem is acknowledged by all parties in Kells and, indeed, by many of the officials I have spoken to in Meath County Council.  I urge the Minister to examine this.  I am sure there are similar cases around the country and provision could be made to give them protection.  The Minister stated what is going to happen, which is that the ownership will transfer from Kells Town Council to Meath County Council.  The danger is that Kells municipal area, which is a great deal more than Kells town, will only have seven votes of the 40 on Meath County Council.  Yes, the lands will still be there, but the rental income from them will go into a county fund and not into the Kells municipal area, as I understand it.  The Minister must be able to think of a solution.<\/p><p>I urge him to accept that I raise this matter constructively to highlight a problem which many people would like to have solved.  I hope he will think about it to see if anything can be done in the meantime.  If the land can be transferred to the county council in advance of the legislation, with some conditions, that might be done.  However, I understand there is a stamp duty liability or there are other complications.  Perhaps it is not the done thing or it could be seen as improper to do it before the legislation is passed.  Perhaps the Minister would to ask an official to look at this and liaise with senior officials in Kells.  Mr. Stewart in Kells is from that area and he is very supportive of maintaining this.  The council has no plans to sell it.  I am not trying to raise any fears, but it has been protected for hundreds of years and we have a duty to continue to protect it, if we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600065#UUU00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1383769200,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I appreciate Senator Byrne's bona fides on this matter.

It is the largest Irish language festival.  It was a very good festival and there was a good buzz.  However, that was dampened to a great extent by an announcement by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, last week that there will be a change in the way people will be recruited to the civil and public service.  Many suggestions have been made over the last number of years regarding how to improve the number of people in the civil and public service who can do their business as Gaeilge and support the communities around the country who wish to do that.  The decision taken by the Government was wholeheartedly condemned by almost everybody I spoke to at the festival.  These are people who are trying to avail of these services on a daily basis.<\/p><p>A number of people have made strong statements on the decision.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, who has a huge amount of expertise and has spoken on this issue and written about it in many of his reports, stated the new system would be an absolute disaster, teip tubaisteach, as regards trying to increase the number of Irish speakers in these services.  It will push B&eacute;arla &eacute;igeantach don phobal lena gn&oacute;tha&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh leis an St&aacute;t.  It is compulsory English for Irish speakers if they wish to engage with the State.  Conradh na Gaeilge has said that there was a golden opportunity here for the Government to do something positive.  It is widely accepted that we must increase the number of people who can do their daily work through the medium of Irish.<\/p><p>It is suggested that 6% of people recruited to the public service will have to be Irish speakers.  How did the Minister arrive at that figure?  There does not appear to have been any research conducted in recent years that would suggest a figure of 6%.  I have read a number of reports on the Irish language in the last few years and this does not appear to have been a suggestion by any of the experts in this area.  This figure is not in the Government's 20 year strategy for the Irish language, which is supposed to be the blueprint for increasing the number of Irish speakers in the State to 250,000 over that period.<\/p><p>What research has been done on this decision?  Has the figure been plucked out of the air?  Who arrived at it?  Is there a plan for how the 6% will be deployed in the different Departments?  In the Department of Education and Skills, for example, which is one of the key Departments for promoting the Irish language, if one removes teachers from the equation only 3% of the people working in the administration side of the Department can do their business through the medium of Irish.  That is a huge reduction from the position in the Department previously.  In addition, we have seen with numerous reports from the Language Commissioner in the last number of years a certain belligerence on the part of some Government Departments in respect of engaging with people and taking on board his recommendations for providing their services through the medium of Irish.  Who will be in charge of this new plan?  From where did the plan emerge?  On what research is it based?  Has some socioeconomic or linguistic research been carried out to support that figure and explain why it is being used?  Who will be in charge of the implementation and how will the figure be divided across different Departments?  Will there be priority Departments that deliver front-line services in Gaeltacht areas, for example, and to Irish speaking communities at which it will be targeted?<\/p><p>People in the Irish language community think this decision is an absolute disgrace.  They see no merit in it and believe it will be hugely detrimental to the provision of services.  They also believe it is contradictory to the Government's 20 year strategy to promote the Irish language.  We call for it to be reviewed and for the Government to return to the recommendations in the 20 year strategy and to implement them fully.

I apologise that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is unable to come to the House to address the issue this evening.<\/p><p>The policy of awarding bonus marks for Irish language proficiency in Civil Service competitions was introduced following the abolition of compulsory Irish in the 1970s.  In developing pragmatic policies in support of Irish language proficiency to replace the existing legacy policy, the Minister was guided by a public policy imperative to develop a coherent set of measures that support service delivery through Irish in the 21st century.  In formulating the new policy the Minister was conscious that the bonus marks scheme was not, in practice, achieving its policy objective.  The uptake of the scheme was low and those awarded bonus marks were not being utilised to provide services through Gaeilge.<\/p> <p> The Minister's focus since taking office has been on driving change and reform across the public service to make it better performing and more fit for purpose.  In this context, we are rolling out more strategic workforce planning policies to ensure the right people are in the right place to deliver effective policy initiatives and support efficient service delivery.  Within this overarching policy, Irish language proficiency policy for the Civil Service has been refocused to provide more meaningful and effective services through Irish.  The Government's implementation plan for the 20-year strategy for the Irish language 2010-2030 includes measures aimed at building capacity in the provision of Irish language services in the Civil Service.  The workforce planning process will be amended to require Departments and Government offices to identify posts and areas of work requiring staff who are functional bilinguals.<\/p><p>We have now given practical effect to the commitments in the measures to support Irish language proficiency in the Civil Service that were unveiled last week.  The policy includes provision for a sub-panel of functional bilinguals equal to 6% of the main panel for future recruitment and, where appropriate, promotion competitions.  Successful candidates from the main competition panel will be tested on the basis of a rigorous written and oral Irish test.  Successful candidates must be able to provide a full range of services to customers, and internally within Departments, in Irish, and will be designated for that purpose for a period of time.  We will pilot this approach in the upcoming executive officer competition to assess demand for functional bilinguals across Departments.  If demand exists, the scheme will be applied to future competitions.<\/p><p>The shift from the policy of awarding bonus marks for Irish in competitions - which demonstrably did not achieve the required policy outcome - to an approach that puts in place a panel of functional bilinguals for deployment across the system is designed to renew and strengthen Irish language proficiency across the Civil Service.  We see scope for greater linkages between the Irish language schemes and strategic workforce planning so as to ensure Departments clearly identify the need, if any, for service delivery through Irish in a structured way.  This more targeted and direct approach acknowledges, in a tangible way, the continued importance of service provision through Irish.<\/p><p>In tandem with the functional bilingual policy, there is an ongoing need for an Irish language training and proficiency assessment regime for existing civil servants.  The service level agreement between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht supports capacity building and provides a practical mechanism to support Irish language training services and proficiency testing.<\/p><p>In conclusion, resourcing policy for the Irish language must have a greater competency-based focus.  The new measures represent a very real improvement and go a long way towards achieving this outcome.  The legacy policy was not providing service delivery in Irish, and the measures agreed last week are the first step on the road to a more realistic and coherent policy in this area.  The policy is intended to meet our stated commitment under the 20-year strategy and to create a supply of functional bilinguals for deployment across the Civil Service in the medium to longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600065#UUU00500","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383769800,"counter":712,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire St&aacute;it.

The point the Minister made in his remarks last week, in setting out the new policy, is that the previous policy in terms of bonus points for Irish was not achieving that objective.  We have, therefore, decided to try something different, albeit by way of a pilot scheme.  The objective is to assess, in a more effective way, the requirements within the public sector for people to speak the language and to ensure we have those people in place.  There are two basic requirements here.  The first is that we have people who are skilled in the language and can deal with the public in a competent way.

Unfortunately, however, the current crisis caused by the outbreak of blue ear disease in pigs could put all of that potential at risk.<\/p><p>I will not go into the background of the recent disease outbreak; I am sure the Minister of State is fully acquainted with it.  I am asking that he and his officials sit down with the affected parties and various interest groups to see what can be done to provide relief.  It has been estimated that up to 33% of the national herd is affected, which equates to some 48,0000 sows.  Pig farmers are losing significant income as a result of the disease outbreak, at a time when they have spent extensive moneys in providing facilities required under the EU animal welfare regulations.  In fact, an estimated &euro;40 million was spent by pig farmers across the country by way of investment in animal welfare measures.<\/p><p>Now their income stream is being absolutely decimated.  I am advised, for instance, that the national pig kill could be down by 10%.  Some of the processing units, instead of working five or five and a half days per week, are currently operational for only three or four days.  Jobs and income are being lost as pig farmers face this very grave crisis.  Will the Minister of State give serious consideration to providing financial compensation?  This is a sector which has had many difficult days and difficult battles but was certainly on the road to improvement.<\/p> <p>Significant amounts of money have been taken from it and if we want the 2020 plan to succeed and to ensure the future of a strong pig industry in this country, with all that it offers, we must provide immediate financial assistance.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to treat this crisis with the utmost seriousness and to offer some form of financial response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600066#VVV00400","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1383770400,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bradford for raising this important matter.  It gives me the opportunity to state the Department's position on it.<\/p><p>  Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, PRRSV, causes a disease in pigs called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, PRRS, also known as blue-ear pig disease, and is a widespread disease affecting domestic pigs.  The symptoms include reproductive failure, pneumonia and increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection.  It is caused by a virus classified as a member of the genus Arterivirus.  PRRS was first recognised in the United States in 1987 and the causative virus was identified in the Netherlands in 1991.  The virus is often transmitted by the movement of infected animals.  Pigs born to infected dams may not show disease signs, but can still shed the virus.  The virus is also found in faeces, urine and semen and can be spread by vehicles or supplies.  Insects have also been found to be a potential source of spread.  The virus may also be wind borne.<\/p><p>  The clinical signs are reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disease in young pigs.  The reproductive failure is characterised by infertility, abortions, stillbirths or the birth of weak piglets that often die of respiratory failure after birth.  The stage of gestation or the immune status of the sow determines the effects of infection.  Diagnosis is made on serological testing and commercial vaccines are available and have been effective in controlling outbreaks and economic losses.<\/p><p>  PRRS is notifiable in accordance with the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 (Notification and Control of Animal Diseases) Order 2008, Statutory Instrument 101 of 2008.  This order requires the compulsory notification of a number of diseases to my Department.  Where such diseases are notified, a number of options are available.  The options depend on the actual disease.  Notification of a disease does not prescribe that any specific action must be taken by my Department.<\/p><p>  There are no specific rules governing PRRS at EU level.  PRRS is considered endemic in many areas of the Union.  PRRS was retained as notifiable under Irish legislation as it was identified in only a relatively small number of Irish pig farms and the controls applied were designed to minimise the opportunity of spread from infected herds to clear herds.  The controls applied included the restriction of the movement of pigs and products or by-products except under licence.  This policy was developed in agreement with the Irish pig industry, which used PRRS freedom as a quality assurance mechanism.  It also enabled certification of products to certain third countries that required that product only be supplied from PRRS free herds.<\/p><p>  The existing rules were modified last September.  The key changes include that PRRS remains a notifiable disease - herds that have clinical signs of PRRS must report the disease to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; herds will no longer be restricted for the disease; all herds that were restricted at the time were de-restricted immediately; herds that notify the Department of outbreaks will be placed on a central list at headquarters to allow basic monitoring of the situation and to assist in the certification of meat at factory level - this is now a &quot;notified list&quot;, not a restricted list as was the case previously; herds can be removed from this &quot;notified list&quot; if they can provide a veterinary certificate that there have been no clinical signs of PRRS for the past six months; vaccines must still be applied for from the medicines section; and as these herds are no longer restricted, they are not excluded from trade in live pigs to Northern Ireland.  There have been no adverse effects on third country exports.<\/p><p>  With regard to compensation, like Senator Bradford I acknowledge that there are many jobs and significant investment in this business.  People have spent significant amounts on providing better accommodation for their animals.  The figure of &euro;40 million suggested by the Senator is one on which I could agree.  I understand why people who have invested so heavily are extremely concerned.  However, the fact that a disease is notifiable does not confer any right to compensation.  Compensation in respect of losses due to disease is not automatic.  In fact, compensation is only considered where a diseased animal is slaughtered by order of the Department for the purposes of preventing spread of the disease to other livestock.<\/p><p>  There is no aid scheme in place in Ireland to provide compensation to farmers whose herds are affected by PRRS.  As the Senator may be aware, any compensation provided to farmers in the context of an outbreak of disease is subject to state aid rules which are laid down at EU level.  These rules prescribe, <i>inter alia<\/i>, that compensation for losses due to animal diseases can only be considered where there is an appropriate programme at EU, national or regional level for the prevention, control or eradication of the disease concerned.  Aids which simply compensate farmers for losses incurred without taking any steps to remedy the problem at source must be considered as pure operating aids which are incompatible with the Common Market.  There is no national eradication programme involving the payment of compensation in place in Ireland and there are no plans to introduce such a programme.<\/p><p>  However, in view of the seriousness of the situation outlined by the Senator, I will ensure this is monitored on an ongoing basis.  It affects a large number of people who have put much investment into this sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600067#WWW00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1383770400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister's interest and willingness to monitor the situation, but I am disappointed with his response.  I am requesting that some type of financial compensation be put in place.  The Minister outlined the reasons it cannot happen under certain analyses, but there obviously is a need for the Minister of State, the Minister and the officials to meet with the people who have been affected to see how the rules can be made more flexible and responsive.  The Minister of State said that aids \"which simply compensate farmers for losses incurred without taking any steps to remedy the problem... are incompatible with the Common Market.\"  However, if a scheme were put in place that would take the required steps to remedy the problem at source, it will get around that issue.  I appreciate that money is in short supply, not just in the Minister's Department but in every Department, but we must look on this as a long-term investment and an insurance policy to ensure that the pig industry will remain functioning, active and growing into the future.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to talk to his officials and to officials at EU level.  If the Oireachtas and the Department do nothing, this industry could reach a stage where it could be almost wiped out.  We cannot afford to have between 30% and 50% of pig farmers made financially unviable as a result of this unfortunate outbreak.  I am not expecting a miracle response tonight but I ask the Minister to enter into negotiations with the affected parties to see if some type of compromise and, most importantly, some degree of financial compensation can be found.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600067#WWW00300","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1383770400,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I accept that the pig industry is hugely important in this country.

There is enormous potential.  Every time the Minister leaves the country he sees growing opportunities for our food industry.  It is a very exciting industry.<\/p><p>However, I am not in a position, and it would be quite wrong, to say more.  I will certainly discuss it with the officials and see what can be done.  The situation might be getting worse than it was some time ago.  I will revert to the Senator.  If the Senator has specific cases in mind and some figures on the issue, perhaps he would furnish me with them and I will talk to the Minister and the officials.  Money is scarce as the recent budget proved.  It was very difficult to agree the budget.  It took a lot of time and there was much pressure from sectors such as forestry, dairy and suckler producers.  Across the agriculture industry we had difficulty getting the budget we succeeded in securing.  However, if we can have a discussion on this issue, I will try to do something later for the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013110600067#WWW00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1383770400,"counter":720,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 11.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 November 2013.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
