In this statement  I will cover four areas.  I will give an overview of Coillte and outline the progress made in our transformation in recent years, our vision for the future, where we see Coillte in the next few years and the role we think it can play in dealing with the climate change agenda.<\/p> <p>  Coillte is a commercial forestry company owned by the State.  It manages 7% of the country's land, from which it runs three strong businesses, all of which have significant potential.  Our core business is forestry.  Coillte is in a leading position in the forestry industry in Ireland and, more broadly, Europe.  The forestry resource in Ireland is crucial.  It contributes &euro;2.3 billion to the economy on an annual basis and supports 12,000 jobs.  Most importantly, these jobs, in the main, are in rural areas.  Forestry is also an international business.  Each year it is estimated that there are 40,000 international truck movements from Ireland, predominantly to the United Kingdom and other European countries.  The industry is forecast to double in size in the next ten years owing to the planting that has taken place in the past 20 years.<\/p> <p>  Coillte's position in the forestry sector is to support ten large forestry customers, to which we sell 1.7 million m&sup3; of timber every year.  Last year Coillte planted 18 million trees.  Therefore, it has a key role in addressing the effects of climate change.  It also has a key role in mobilising the private supply of wood fibre on the island.  In order to do this, we recently launched Coillte Premium Partners.  The group is also investing an awful lot in technology to ensure we will have world class estate and forestry management practices in this country.  <\/p> <p>  In addition to its core forestry business, Coillte is a major provider of public goods.<\/p><p>We have several flagship recreational sites throughout the country, and we have a significant role to play in carbon sequestration.  We estimate that our estate stores 200 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, and adds 1 to 2 million tonnes per year as the estate grows.  We also have large areas contributing to biodiversity and nature conservation.<br\/><br\/>In our second division, Medite Smartply, we manufacture sustainable and innovative medium density fibreboard, MDF, and oriented strand board, OSB,<b><\/b>in two plants in the south east of Ireland that export product to more than 30 countries around the globe.  We are a market leader in MDF and OSB construction materials and value added products.  We recently invested &euro;59 million in a plant in Waterford, and &euro;68 million in a joint venture with BP and Axis on innovative new products that will be sold around the world, providing a market for the two plants in Waterford and Clonmel.<br\/><br\/>In our third division, land solutions, we take land that is less suitable for forestry and try to add value to it, in line with Government policy in supporting key infrastructure such as renewable energy, housing, tourism and recreation projects.  We have played a key role in delivering the renewable energy targets through our renewable energy portfolio.<br\/><br\/>Over the past three years, Coillte has been on a transformational journey.  We are on a journey to becoming the best forestry and land solutions company in Europe.  We are changing from an organisation that did not make any money on an annual basis from its &euro;1.5 billion worth of assets, to one that will contribute &euro;30 million in operating cash this year.  Coillte is moving away from depending on one-off land sales to drive the performance of the business, and towards a more sustainable model of leasing land, ensuring that land and recurring cash are coming into the organisation.  This year we will have doubled the dividend that we pay back to the State and the shareholder from &euro;4 million in 2014 to &euro;8 million in 2017.  We have restructured the business quite significantly, taking &euro;20 million in costs out of the business.  This makes us more competitive and also makes the business more sustainable into the future.<br\/><br\/>In our forestry business, I am delighted to say that last year we had a record planting year, planting 18 million trees.  This is a 30% improvement on 2014 and is crucially important in ensuring the sustainability of the organisation.  This year, we are on track to sell 1.7 million cu. m of sawlogs, the highest volume in ten years.  This is important to our forestry customers throughout the country.  We have invested more than &euro;10 million in world-class technology to help manage our businesses, and we are maintaining and building on strong relationships with more than 1,000 forestry contractors across the country.<br\/><br\/>Over the past 12 months, we have been working with partners in the industry on understanding the concern and risks around Brexit and its impact on our business and theirs.  We have put together a Brexit forum to address those issues for the broader sector.  It is a crucially important sector, one that is growing strongly, and we need to make sure it stays that way.  We have been working on innovative biodiversity classification projects to ensure that we continue our role in climate change.  In the tourism and recreation sector, we have been cornerstone leaders in the national outdoor recreation plan.  We have concluded a &euro;500,000 project with F&aacute;ilte Ireland this year to bring substance to key areas around the Wild Atlantic Way and east coast initiatives, and to ensure that we align with F&aacute;ilte Ireland's initiatives.<br\/><br\/>In regard to sustainable wood panels, we have focused our business much more on value added products, moving away from commodity products over that period.  As part of our effort to enable national infrastructure, along with our partners we have invested in excess of &euro;400 million in wind energy across the estate.  We have identified one gigawatt of energy that we can develop over the next ten to fifteen years.  We will not be doing this on our own.  Coillte will partner with another concern so that we can focus on our core forestry business.<br\/><br\/>What will Coillte look like in 2019?  We believe that we can and will be the best forestry and land solutions company by 2019 or 2020.  That means that we will have a business that first and foremost is sustainable from a financial perspective.  It will have world-class recreational facilities and environmental services.  Importantly, we believe it can play a key role as an enabler of renewable energy in this country.  It will also play a key role in helping Ireland to tackle its increasing climate change challenges and ensuring that we allow other sectors to grow.<br\/><br\/>Coillte plays a significant role today in mitigating climate change in four key areas.  First and foremost is the carbon sequestration on forested lands.  As I mentioned, we have a store of 200 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in our land, and this grows by 1 to 2 million tonnes per year through the growth of forests.  We are also working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to play a more active role around afforestation.  The low-carbon wood panel-based products produced in our businesses in Waterford and Clonmel are a good substitute for non-sustainable materials in the building sector.  They are also are an important store of carbon.<\/p><p>In the biomass area, Coillte provides a triple carbon benefit from substituting biomass for fossil fuels.  In the renewable energy sector, there is significant scope for Coillte to help achieve Ireland's targets through our renewable energy, wind farms and solar energy portfolio.<\/p><p> We think that Coillte is very well positioned to play a leading role in the Irish bio-economy.  This is a reflection of our work In planting forests.  We plant 18 million trees every year, and we are looking to further increase that over the next three years.  We have a robust land mitigation strategy.  Historically, Coillte sold land but did not replace it.  Nowadays, when we do sell land for various reasons, we mitigate that by acquiring other land which is put into forestry.  That is an important policy that we have adopted to ensure that our overall productive estate grows.  We are working intensely with the Department to understand how we can help to grow the forest cover in this country from 11% to 14% in the coming years.<\/p><p> On the topic of sustainable forest management, I note that Coillte manages its forest in a way that maximises carbon sequestration, not only from a commercial perspective, but also from a carbon-storing perspective.  Some 20% of our land today is managed for biodiversity purposes.  As regards increased forest productivity, we have invested in technology which allows us to manage our estate more efficiently.  This allows us to optimise truck movements and carry out work in the forest in a much more efficient and environmentally friendly way.  In regard to the private forestry initiative, we have now launched the Coillte Premium Partners scheme.  This will be key to mobilising the private supply of fibre by effectively paying farmers and other landowners a cash yield in years 20 plus to allow them to manage their forests and to continue to receive benefit until the final felling at 40 years.<\/p><p> In the biomass area, there is a triple carbon benefit, as I have mentioned.  Carbon is sequestered when forest grows, we displace high embedded carbon products, and we have a carbon neutral heat and energy plan.  We believe we are well on the way to being the best forestry and land solutions company in Europe, and I believe we can play a significant role in helping Ireland to meet its challenging emissions targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Leamy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and giving their rundown of Coillte's position.  As has been said, Coillte is one of the largest landowners in the country.  It has a vast resource there.  I have a couple of questions around that.<\/p> <p>  One question is in regard to the exports.  Mr. Leamy says that Coillte is trying to enhance the value of the product through processing, some of which takes place in the company's two plants.  How much of the timber is exported out of the country in bulk timber and what value leaves the country?  Is any processing carried out here?<\/p> <p>  The other issue concerns wind energy.  The wind energy business has been prone to causing conflict with communities in many parts of the country.  What is Coillte's position in that regard?  I know many people are talking about the distances between larger wind turbines and communities, people and households.  Does Coillte have particular policy around that?  Where does it stand?<\/p> <p>  I was interested in the final slide, which concerned replacing land sales with partnerships or with leasing land.  Mr. Leamy also spoke about the Coillte Premium Partnership.  I have come across a number of concerns around the partnership scheme.  I know that there are between 700 and 800 people currently in partnerships with Coillte, and many of them are very dissatisfied.  I have a couple of questions about that.  When farmers enter into a partnership with Coillte, do they have any role in deciding whether to accept the price that is offered for their timber when it is extracted?  I would also like to know the role of the farmer in the decision as to whether to sell the timber at a particular time.  I have come across farmers who say that when timber is at its bottom price but Coillte needs to move timber out, it is the partnership's timber that they take rather than the timber from their own forestry.  Farmers feel that the contracts that they signed up to are being breached in some cases or certainly being stretched, with a negative impact on them.  I would like to get the witnesses' response to all that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#L00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Leamy and his colleagues here today, and I thank them for their presentation.  It is good to see a return being delivered to the State over recent years in the form of a financial contribution.  That is a positive development.<\/p><p>The move to ensure Coillte's landbanks and resources are better utilised for multiple purposes, such as for recreation and tourism, adds value which we would like to continue.  The move to ensure value is added to Coillte's product before it is exported is also positive and should continue.<\/p><p> It was stated earlier that when buying land, Coillte mitigates by replacing it.  Is Coillte expanding its land holdings or are they remaining constant?  Is it making more use of its current landbanks?  It was also indicated that it has had ongoing engagement with the Government on how afforestation levels could be increased from 11% to 14%.  Will the witnesses expand on what ideas have been discussed in this regard and what initiatives need to be taken to ensure this can be achieved?<\/p><p> It is hoped we will achieve a positive outcome with Brexit.  The UK is a significant market for Coillte products.  What is Coillte's perspective on how Brexit will impact on forestry?  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on and develop that.<\/p><p> The witnesses mentioned premium partnering with farmers and Deputy Kenny touched on that.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the take-up of this scheme and farmer feedback on it?  I recently met the IFA which is particularly concerned that the payment structure for the take-up of forestry by the farming community is not sufficient to encourage it.  In too many cases, it is too acute in some areas, while in other parts of the country, it is not being embraced where it could be.  What is Coillte's perspective on farmers taking up forestry?  There is a threshold on the amount of unenclosed land which can be planted.  Should this be reviewed to encourage more forestry planting?  I would welcome the witnesses' views on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#L00300","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Coillte for its presentation.  Unusually for a presentation, we got much information in bullet format and there is much to be digested.<\/p> <p>  Last year, Coillte sold 1.7 million cu. m of logs and planted 18 million trees.  How much of those were bought from private operators and how much were grown by Coillte?  How does that break down between being bought from partnerships or from wholly owned Coillte sites?<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses elaborate on the section of the presentation on land solutions?  What part does Coillte feel it has to play in this?  It stated it would plant 18 million trees in 2017, up 30% from 2014.  Was this the target or what was the target?  Is Coillte ahead of target or is it behind target?<\/p><p>On sustainable forest management, bogs, uplands, native forests and rare habitats, what are Coillte's views on the bogs Bord na M&oacute;na has and the role it has to play in biodiversity?  Does Coillte believe we are fully realising the potential of these lands with regard to the climate change targets we must meet?<\/p><p> Bord na M&oacute;na plans to invest &euro;60 million in wood chip production in Georgia in the United States and to bring it back to Ireland for burning.  What is Coillte's view of the economic benefit of such a scheme?  With regard to Coillte's plans to expand acreage and increase the potential of our forestry sector, it is utter madness to invest in such a plant in the United States.  Shipping wood products back here to burn is like taking coal to Newcastle.  I cannot see how that can be of benefit for meeting any climate change targets.<\/p><p> There is a blanket ban on afforestation on hen harrier lands.  Has Coillte tried to get common sense into this analysis?  There have been some discussions about a new scheme for hen harrier lands.  There is a strong scientific case that different stages of forestry growth would be for the benefit of the hen harrier.  In Tipperary, vast tracts of land have been made worthless by various hen harrier regulations put in place.  As a State body, does Coillte believe we can win this argument?<\/p><p> I have had a number of calls from private forestry farmers unhappy with Coillte.  One point was on insurance coverage for forestry.  The understanding was that it was Coillte's responsibility but the farmers felt the onus was put on them.  They also felt they had no say on when thinnings would occur or when the trees would be cut down.  They felt it was a pig in a poke not knowing if they were getting value for money.  If this kind of relationship is to work, there will have to be more communication between Coillte and their partnership members.  There is a distinct lack of trust, with the private operators feeling they are not getting a fair crack of the whip.<\/p><p> Several months ago a private operator, who employed eight people, told me Coillte had stopped purchasing forestry thinnings from him.  As he had nowhere else to sell them, he had built up a serious tonnage of thinnings.  Are there times when Coillte refuses to take thinnings off private operators?<\/p><p> Several weeks ago I attended a meeting with the Minister, the Department and interested forestry stakeholders about the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, mid-term review.  Some stakeholders are unhappy with the proposed changes from Brussels and what greater financial incentives will be put in place.  What is Coillte's view on the mid-term review?  Are there any proposals it would like to see included in it?<\/p><p> The presentation was detailed.  The company's performance is good and forestry has significant potential for our economy.  I am a farmer by trade and I believe forestry has its place in farming.  However, the barriers being put on where we can plant forestry are ridiculous, meaning it will never compete with commercial farming.  If we are to meet our climate change targets, our attitude to unenclosed land, as Deputy McConalogue said, has to change.  I cannot see the logic of these blanket bans or of making it very difficult to plant unenclosed land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#M00200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will try to answer as many of the questions as I can and then my colleague, Mr. Murphy, will answer some questions specifically on forestry.  Deputy Kenny asked how much is exported in raw material form without value added.  Very little is exported from this island on which there is not some value added.  We estimate the total exports of timber products to be around &euro;700 million a year.  All of that is material taken from our forests and processed in processing facilities throughout the country or turned from a log into a construction material such as C16 which is used in roofing in the UK and other places.  In our two facilities in Waterford and Clonmel, we take the fibre and put it into boards, either MDF or OSB, and add a lot of value to the boards before we export them.  Very little is exported off the island without adding value.  Having said that, there is further opportunity for us to add even more value and move away from commodity construction products into higher value added items, which is why we are investing in our facilities in the south east to try to get as much value for each piece of timber that comes out of our factories as possible.  We might get &euro;10 for a normal OSB piece of timber, but if we treat it and make it fire resistant or suitable for outdoor use, we can get multiples of that from the same piece of fibre.  The focus should be on that and on innovation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of wind energy and the conflict with communities, we are fairly distinctive in how we approach wind energy development in local communities.  We are hugely conscious of the impact it has on local communities.  Not all wind energy development is the same.  We have to meet our targets by 2020 and beyond and we should be playing a strong role in that.  Renewable energy is a way that Ireland can do that and it has a competitive advantage in doing so.  We need to be much more thoughtful in how we engage with communities.  A good example of a wind farm we have recently opened is in Raheenleagh in Wicklow.  Before we had a wind farm there, we had maybe 20 or 30 visitors in a weekend.  On some weekends over the summer there were several hundred visitors to that facility because we put in facilities such as car parks, picnic benches, paths and trails.  We are opening up the forest, renewable energy and wind turbines in a way that is sympathetic to the environment and can co-exist with local communities.  More needs to be done and will be done as we think about the next stage.  It is an advantage for Coillte to develop some of these things.<\/p> <p>  There are two issues in terms of replacing land we sell and the dissatisfaction with the current partnership.  Coillte Premium Partners is a new product we have launched in recent months.  The Deputy referred to the farm partnerships, which go back a number of years.  Mr. Murphy will comment further on them.  I will provide some perspective.  I agree there are significant lessons that need to be learned in those partnerships.  The partnerships were launched 15 or 20 years ago and are now coming up to that initial stage.  There are 700 or so of those partnerships in existence.  Farmers believe some are very strong but we are getting feedback that they are not happy with others.  I agree with Deputy Cahill's viewpoint that communication will be key in helping people to understand these and that we should make it less complex in order that people understand the product.  We have taken it on board and it is something we are working hard at.  We want to make sure that when we talk to farmers about the product, there is as much communication as possible.  We are addressing the old farm partnerships with our farm partners as they come up and working through each of the issues that arise.  There are numerous examples around the country where people have had concerns.  They have approached us and we have engaged with them on the farm partnerships.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Leamy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Communication is very important.

There was a question from Deputy McConalogue on our overall mitigation plan and whether we are expanding our estate.  Since 1989, when Coillte became a commercial semi-State company, an additional 40,000 ha have been purchased and the estate has increased by that number.<\/p><p>In the last number of years, it has been pretty much net neutral in terms of impact because we do not have a desire to grow that significantly further.  It is about optimising the portfolio now and replacing land that is not ideally suited for forest with forestry land which we can drive better from a productive forestry perspective.  <\/p><p> On the expansion of afforestation, I cannot go into too much detail on this issue.  We have been working intensely with the Department over the last few months on creating options to allow Coillte to play a bigger role in afforestation.  Traditionally, what holds us back is that Coillte is not entitled to the premium willow grants to afforest to which the private sector is entitled and this puts us at a disadvantage and means that we do not make a commercial return from afforestation.  However, we are working with the Department on how we can use some of the increase in returns from the organisation in a different way to take account of afforestation and to enable the organisation to meet some of the gaps in terms of the targets that have been set.  We will not be found wanting in trying to hit those targets.  We believe this makes good sense not only from a climate change perspective but from a business perspective because it helps to sustain a growing forestry sector and industry in this country.<\/p><p> In terms of Brexit and how it will impact on the forest sector, the impact will be significant given approximately 85% of the material that we and our customers produce goes to the UK.  The UK is a significant market for us and so we need to ensure that we can trade seamlessly into the UK.  We are doing a lot of work with various people in Dublin and in London and Brussels to ensure that they understand how we do that.  Logistics rather than tariffs are the concern of the forest sector and industry.  We need to ensure we continue the growth of this sector.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill asked for further information on land solutions.  We have transferred 15,000 ha from our core forestry business into land solutions.  Those 15,000 ha have been identified as not ideal for forestry and more suited to renewable energy projects and housing.  For example, we have responded to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government request for a number of sites.  There is a site in Moycullen on which there is no forestry and it can be used to meet some of the housing need in that area.  We will mitigate that land that is not currently under forestry by replacing it with land on which we will lay forest.  There is a role for Coillte in terms of national broadband infrastructure provision and we are working with the Department on a number of initiatives around the last kilometre of the rural broadband scheme.  We are facilitating this through the use of wireless technology from our sites and masts.  We are custodians of 7% of the country's land and we should be an enabler of Government policy in different areas; we see this as an area which it is appropriate to separate out from the core forestry business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#P01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fergal Leamy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Perhaps the witness would respond to my question on unenclosed land and the thresholds in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#Q00200","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>It is a very pertinent question at the moment.

This year, they will be between 5,000 and 6,000.  It comes down to the barriers to afforestation and how they can be addressed.  There are a number of barriers.  Many members spoke about land availability and unenclosed land and how we can increase the availability of land in the right areas to enable further planting of forests.  This issue needs to be addressed.  It is a structural issue as opposed to an incentives issue.  Land price is making it difficult from an economic point of view to plant trees.  Another issue for farmers is the permanency of land use change in that once they have agreed to plant trees longer term they have locked in that land use.  In other land uses, it is possible to change on a regular basis.  We need to address how we can overcome that.  From a policy point of view, forests and carbon is very important.  We need forest cover and our current forest cover is very low.  Permanency of land use is driving some of the behaviour of farmers.  As I said, they believe that once they lock in land that is it.  We need to address this issue.<\/p> <p>  Another issue is continuity of income.  This is an issue around the incentive schemes.  We need to examine how the incentive schemes around agriculture and forestry are constructed as they tend to be working in two separate streams.  We need to integrate forestry much more into a land use strategy where it is seen very much as another form of agricultural land use.  The integration of the different incentives must be considered.  A number of members alluded to the issue of continuity of income and how we can address the gap between year 20 and clear fell.<\/p><p>There are thinnings but, from that point of view, it gives farmers greater certainty about their income and when material will come out.  That comes down to education and training.  The forest culture in Ireland is quite low.  In Europe, forestry is seen very much as part of the farm enterprise but we are still at a much more immature stage in Ireland, given that forestry is, one could argue, only 100 years old.  It is hundreds of years old in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#R01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>The witnesses talked about farmers having concerns because their lands are locked in and they went through the various issues there.  It would appear, at least in certain communities, that it can be perceived as a negative thing at times that the land is planted because there is not much else going on.  There is not much other employment, activity or so on and I know the witnesses have given figures on people employed.  We need to see value added to forestry.  I am from Mayo and my understanding is that most of the wood that Coillte fells goes on a train from Ballina to Waterford.  Does Coillte have any plans to add value in the western region?  I am not just talking about Mayo but the west.  One would hear this comment about forestry.  I recognise the many positive aspects to Coillte's work and endeavours, including carbon sequestration, tourism, and recreation.  Coillte has partnered more with communities which have an interest in promoting these things but it is stark that the wood is leaving and no value is being added.  These are the types of jobs which we want to see created in rural Ireland where value is being added to products and material coming from the earth.<\/p><p>I will address wind farms.  I understand Coillte has developed its business in the area of renewables.  Communication is important and I do not know if Coillte has the best track record with it.  I refer in particular to the application made at Cluddaun in Moygownagh in County Mayo.  It was refused because it was deemed to be over-industrialised by An Bord Plean&aacute;l&aacute;.  One of the hallmarks of people's complaints related to communication.  People have to be engaged with much more, whether about planting or wind farms.  I will contrast it with some private wind developers which seem to handle communities much better than Coillte.  I do not want to name other State bodies but the witnesses know which are involved in building wind farms and other renewable projects.  I do not know why but people seem to get rubbed up the wrong way.  It is important to have community acceptance and it has to be understood where people are coming from with regard to massive infrastructure.  There is a conversation to be had.  It is not just a case of stating what is available and that a person is to take or leave it, or what a community's contribution is, or that a community will get a walk or a forest trail.  People deserve more than that.  In areas where people are doing energy projects, that will help us to achieve our renewable energy targets but people are not asked to do that in a city.  They are asked to do it in rural, often very scenic areas.  There has to be a balance.<\/p><p>I understand that even where land is forested, there can be a wind corridor and turbines can still be put up.  How much more land has Coillte identified where that can be done?  That would seem to get over the visual impact concern that many people have about wind farms.  How much more land is it possible for Coillte to develop in that way, bearing in mind issues such as connection to the grid?  I understand that it has to be possible to connect to the grid.  There is no point in having power generated in a forest where it cannot be connected to the grid.<\/p><p>I join with my colleagues who have raised concerns about the operation of partnerships with Coillte and private land owners.  Since concerns have been raised, perhaps the witnesses could outline in general what the <i>pro forma<\/i>contract is?  They have mentioned that there are a couple of types of contracts.  Who bears the cost of insurance?  What sort of consultation goes on?  Who bears the cost of felling the trees and the transportation of trees to market?  Who decides on the timing of it?<\/p><p>Is it really a partnership?  How is the payment divided?  Is it 60:40?  Generally, are there certain types of contract?  What are the bones of this for the private landowner's bottom line?  Sufficient concerns have been aired with the witnesses today.  We could do with getting light on how these contracts are operating.  The witnesses themselves acknowledged that some of the contracts were drawn up 15 or 20 years ago.  Will they tell us how those contracts operate with regard to the specific questions raised by members as well as my own?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#S00200","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.

The contracts were constructed in such a way that when we entered into a contract, perhaps at the start of year 0 or year 1, we basically gave a guarantee of an income stream on a yearly basis after the premium finishes.  For example, at year 18, we might kick in with a premium.  The partner in that case would get a steady annual income irrespective of whether we were thinning or not.  One would only thin a crop maybe four or five times in the cycle to clear fell.<\/p><p>The partner in that case will get a premium on an annual basis.  Usually what happens, depending on the contracts, between 20% and 30% of the value of the thinnings will also go to the partner.  The partner will get a steady income every year.  At the thinning stage, the partner will also get share of the profits, maybe 30%.  At clear fell, the partner will get another proportion, again depending on the contract.  It comes down to the appetite for risk.  Many partners prefer to have a steady income stream every year with less of the profit at the end.  That is why we have different types of partnerships depending on appetite for risk.<\/p><p> If we thinned the crop at that stage, we would do all the harvesting and haul with all costs borne by us.

A witness mentioned a figure of 14% that is being discussed with the Government and how Coillte will contribute to that 14%.  I thought the target was 17%.  Are we rolling back now from 17%, which in itself, as the witness pointed out, is about half of the average across Europe?  Are we rolling back on targets yet again?  What is Coillte contributing to the current level of afforestation, which we know is well below what it should be?  I think there are about 6,000 to 7,000 ha of afforestation currently.  How much of that is Coillte actually contributing?<\/p> <p>  I am extremely interested in the non-productive land the witnesses refer to.  A figure of 100,000 ha has been mentioned.

Mr. McCarthy said there was half a million acres.  If I remember correctly, he said half of that would require substantial investment to bring it on, and the rest was not viable in any sense.  I would like to hear more about that.  What somebody might consider commercially viable from a narrow commercial point of view is not necessarily unviable from an environmental, carbon lock-up and biodiversity point of view.  I am not satisfied at all that land written off as not viable for forestry is actually not viable, if one takes a more holistic view of what forestry is and what it can contribute to dealing with climate change, mitigating flooding, and reversing the decline in biodiversity that is happening.  It is not just that we are not enhancing biodiversity; biodiversity is declining.  <\/p> <p>  That brings me on to the diversity of species.  How many of the 18 million trees that Coillte is planting are deciduous?  What is Coillte doing to shift the balance towards a diversity of species, particularly in the broadleaf area?  Are we moving in the right direction?  How fast are we moving in the right direction?  How much of what Coillte is contributing to afforestation is expanding biodiversity and broadleaf species?<\/p><p>Examining the mid-term review, I notice that broadleaf planting nationally is down from 24% in 2014 to 19% currently.  To what extent is Coillte contributing to the worsening of the situation where broadleaf planting is concerned?  The recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, report also refers to deforestation.  It points to deforestation resulting from a number of factors.  One of the significant factors it refers to is wind farms, in which Coillte plays a part.  I have to question what I see as a tension between Coillte's core mandate for afforestation, helping to deal with climate change, biodiversity and being the guardian of the forest estate on one hand, and the imperative to be commercially viable and get involved in non-core projects such as wind farms on the other and whether the two are actually conflicting with one another - in other words, whether the commercial imperative is adversely impacting upon Coillte's core mandate, which is to be the guardian of the forest estate.  The EPA report does not say how much of this problem is Coillte's responsibility, but Coillte is one of the bodies promoting the use of lands owned by the forest estate to develop these wind farms, which may be contributing to deforestation.<\/p><p> Along with others, of whom I am sure the witnesses are aware, I have talked about how the planting of the uplands, particularly with broad-leaf species, might actually contribute very significantly to mitigating flooding downstream.  As the witnesses know, there are projects under way in Wales, where studies suggest this is very significantly reducing flooding.  Should we not use some of these uplands for that?  In particular, should Coillte, whose core mandate is forestry, be using the uplands for that, rather than for building giant wind farms which may actually be contributing to deforestation?  I would like the witnesses to comment on that. <\/p><p> Lastly, I wish to ask about poles for telecommunications.  Is it true that we are importing poles for electricity and telephone cables from outside the country, and that our forest industry cannot even meet that need?  I would like the witnesses to comment on that.  I have been told that is true.  Some 40,000 poles are being imported.  Maybe the witnesses could comment on that, but it seems quite extraordinary. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017121200002#AA00800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of those queries, and my colleague will answer a couple more.  In answer to the Deputy's query on afforestation, 70 ha of that 6,000 will come from Coillte this year.  We have been more or less out of the afforestation game over the last ten or 15 years because we do not get a grant or premium to plant afforestation, so every time we plant a new hectare of land, it is not commercially viable for us to do that.  Having said that, I refer to my earlier comment.  We want to do more and are working with the Department to try to take away some of the barriers in order to allow us to do more and to make us, as the largest forest player in the industry, a vehicle driving afforestation in this country.  It is something that I am personally involved in and helping to alleviate, because I think we should be doing more.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the non-productive areas, there are certainly parts of that 100,000 ha that I quoted which can be used for other biodiversity projects and carbon capture.

I will discuss both of these issues in my presentation.  We will be happy to address any questions the committee might have on these topics.  While we will provide whatever assistance we can, the committee will appreciate that Revenue is constrained by law, specifically by section 8(5)(i)(a) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 from discussing the tax affairs of any taxpayer on confidentiality grounds.  This includes any information that might lead to the identification of a taxpayer. <\/p> <p>  I am sure the committee will appreciate Revenue's role in costings and budgetary matters.  As the tax administration of the State, Revenue collects taxes and duties, and through this we have access to, and are able to provide statistical information and analysis of, tax returns and tax receipts.  While it is our role to provide facts and advice to inform the policy-making process, it would be inappropriate for us to make any comment on policy matters.  <\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, at the introduction of local property tax in 2013, property owners were asked to self-assess the valuation band on their property on 1 May 2013.  The original intention was for this valuation to hold for the purposes of LPT until the end of 2016.  At the time of the first valuation in 2013, Revenue provided extensive valuation guidance to property owners, including an interactive tool on our website and estimates generated with the returns that were sent out to owners.  We ran media and communication campaigns to ensure that property owners were aware of their obligations to assist in meeting these.  In 2015, the Minister for Finance published a review of local property tax implementation by Dr. John Thornhill, which was informed by a public consultation exercise.  Revenue and Department of Finance officials provided information and secretarial support to Dr. Thornhill's review. <\/p> <p>  Dr. Thornhill notes the successful response of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and its staff to the challenge of setting up the new assessment and collection arrangements for this tax.  It should be noted also that compliance with LPT is high, at 97% or 98% for each year of operation so far.<\/p><p>Our most recent statistics for LPT at the end of October 2017 indicate the compliance rate for 2017 is also around 97%.  <br\/><br\/>The valuation period was extended from 31 October 2016 on foot of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015.  The current valuation period is now 1 May 2013 to 31 October 2019.  At the end of the current valuation period, under the current legislation, owners will be expected to value their properties on 1 November 2019 and this will form the basis for the subsequent valuation period.  Revenue intends to run a compliance communications campaign to assist property owners to value their properties and file their returns in the run up to this valuation date.  <br\/><br\/>In the context of the possible budgetary implication of LPT revaluation, it may be of interest to the committee to note that as part of the Thornhill review, the Department of Finance undertook an analysis of the implications of property price increases for LPT liabilities.  At the time of the review in 2015, property prices had risen by 26% nationally and 41% in Dublin since May 2013.  This analysis indicates that based on property prices at that time in 2015, 48% of properties would have remained in their original valuation band and thus not generated any increase in liability; 35% of properties would have moved by one band and thus generated an increased annual liability of &euro;90; and the remaining 17% of properties would have moved by two or more bands.  While more indepth analysis will be required to update this work, it is important to note that this indicates that property price increases do not necessarily translate into liability increases in many cases because of the valuation banding system in LPT.  The Thornhill review made a number of recommendations, some of which have been implemented since.  Any further policy decisions on LPT remain a matter for the Department and the Minister.<br\/><br\/>I will now turn to costings on taxation matters.  An important part of Revenue's role is the provision of high quality advice and support to the Department of Finance and, through the Department, to the Government and the Oireachtas in the development of tax policy.  To assist with this objective, Revenue decided from 2014 to move all of our published statistics derived from tax receipts and returns to a new and dedicated section of our website <i>revenue.ie<\/i>.  This has significantly enhanced the service we provide to policy makers in a number of ways.  Statistics published online, of which we now have over 100 datasets, are published in accessible and machine readable formats.  As well as making it easier for researchers to query and join our data, our approach means we are at the forefront of the Government's open data initiative.  By publishing statistics on our website, we ensure consistency by making the same information available to all.  This also enables us to become more effective in the use of our resources.  By diverting simpler queries to our website and published material, we also have more time to address more complex or specific queries.  I have provided a table that gives more detail on the tables we publish and also on the fact that we answer significant numbers of parliamentary questions.  Around one third of those are answered by reference to published material. <br\/><br\/>With statistics published, they are open to comment or critique.  This makes us more accountable and assists in identifying errors, if any.  In addition, through 2017, we engaged with the Central Statistics Office to achieve the official statistics accreditation which is a type of quality mark to indicate our statistical processes meet a series of quality standards and principles.  In December 2017, the CSO confirmed that Revenue's audited official statistics, which is nearly 50 datasets, can be published under the official statistics quality mark.  Revenue is the first Government Department or office outside of the CSO to achieve this standard.  Our statistics are also more timely.  Whereas previously we published material once a year, we now do so on a regular basis as updated data become available.  We have also dedicated statistical releases, for example monthly reports on the help-to-buy scheme, quarterly reports on LPT and annual profiles of the farming sector.  All of these statistics complement our more in-depth research papers on particular topics of interest.  Perhaps our most significant resource published is our ready reckoner.  The ready reckoner shows the estimated Exchequer impact of changing rates, thresholds, bands and more for nearly all of the main taxes.  The ready reckoner is updated pre-budget and post-budget based on the most recently available data from tax returns and receipts and so presents our best assessment of current conditions and the impacts of potential changes.  <br\/><br\/>For most taxes, costings presented in the ready reckoner assume no behavioural change and for the majority of cases, this is a reasonable approach unless very significant policy changes are being sought, for example, big increases in rates.  An exception to this relates to tobacco products' tax.  Revenue's estimated impact of receipts from changes in excise duty on cigarette packets uses the elasticity measure to partially reflect the responsiveness or change of behaviour of smokers following duty and price changes.  As research shows that smoker behaviour can be quite variable, a range of estimates is used to reflect this.  Variations in tax receipts from tobacco in recent years suggest the use of the range is appropriate but also that the higher end of the range is likely the most suitable to use when undertaking costings.  <br\/><br\/>The committee's invitation notes costings of stamp duty as an interest and these provide a useful case study to outline the method we use to generate costings estimates.  To produce costings for a stamp duty change we use data for recent years to estimate the taxable base.  This is done on a prudent or conservative basis.  In particular, for stamp duty on non-residential property, in estimating the pre-budget 2018 base, the assessment included factoring out a series of very significant transactions in prior years that we deemed to be once-off and thus not likely to reoccur.  Had we not done that, the estimated yield would have been higher.  In addition, revisions to macroeconomic growth forecasts post-budget suggest a slightly higher potential yield than we would have indicated before the budget.<br\/><br\/>We have noted that commentary regarding the basis for the stamp duty increase in budget 2018 has not been supported by estimates in market transaction volumes.  However, based on revenue returns and actual tax paid with regard to non-residential stamp duty, the considerations in the market are around &euro;9 billion or so over the past three years even when once-off factors are excluded.  In summary, Revenue is publishing increasing amounts of information on tax statistics, tax receipts and costings of tax policy options.  We do this because we believe it is a key part of our role to bring what facts we can based on tax returns and other data to the tax policy making process.  We will answer any questions raised by the committee, subject to the constraints I mentioned in my opening comments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017121200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Keith Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh.

We are in 2017 now and we have new figures today showing that in Dublin prices have increased 80% since 2008.  How would the figures Mr. Walsh has be affected by that?  What would the average increase in LPT be for homes in the Dublin area that are being affected most particularly by property tax?  What would the increase in the overall yield of LPT be based on current bands and based on the 2017 valuation?  Will Mr. Walsh clarify a couple of specific situations?  Are new houses built since 2013-2014 when the tax was introduced still excluded from LPT?  What is the position there?  Houses that have been diagnosed with pyrite continue to be excluded from LPT.  There has unfortunately been an expansion of houses that have been found to be affected by pyrite or mica.  What is the process for those house owners to get the exclusion that is available in some parts of the country and not in others?  Is there not unfairness in that?<\/p> <p>  This question is connected to LPT.  As a result of Revenue's success in LPT, it has been recommended as the agent to collect the TV licence fee.

In particular, if Revenue wanted to maintain the yield from the tax as being broadly in line with increases in the consumer price index, has it examined how it would achieve that by maintaining valuations but lowering the rates, which is the way it is approached in a number of countries?  For householders, the idea that on foot of increasing house prices they would face, as indicated by some newspapers, potentially very large increases in the tax, would be very unfair and counterproductive in terms of our understanding of the tax being devoted to funding local services.  Has Revenue carried out any evaluation given current levels of property values and what kind of rate would be appropriate to yield increases or decreases that were broadly in line with the consumer price index?<\/p> <p>  Second, I refer to older people and those who may be in nursing homes or some form of care where they are maintaining their residence in the hope they will return to it but where in practice that hope may turn out not to be realistic.  Many people - the individuals concerned and often family members - are unclear as to what their options are in that situation.  Has Revenue prepared an easy guide in that respect?  I refer in particular to people who may be moving into nursing home care or hospital care over a long period.  In the context of the current housing crisis, constant references have been made to houses that are vacant because a person has gone into hospital or a nursing home in the expectation of returning home.  During that time, however, the house ends up being vacant over a protracted period.  We are constantly told that for many families where a fair deal agreement is involved it causes problems regarding property tax.

We collect the tax and we hand it over to the Exchequer or to the local government fund.  We do have a little  information on the local adjustment factor, which is somewhat related to equalisation.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the local adjustment factor allows local authorities to vary the local property tax rate up or down by 15% of the standard rate.  For example, 11 local authorities have availed of the opportunity to vary the rate for 2018.  In our estimation, this covers approximately 0.9 million properties and will probably lead to a slight increase in the amount collected in local property tax for next year.  Approximately 20 local authorities have decided to not change their rate.  Three local authorities have increased their rate by 10%.  Limerick City and County Council has increased its rate by 7.5% and two other councils have increased it by 5%.  Waterford City and County Council has increased its rate by 2.5%.

Has the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government contacted Revenue about this issue?  As I said, there is a stream of empty houses, certainly in my constituency, that are not occupied.  Does Revenue have round-table meetings with other players, particularly the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, local authorities and the Health Service Executive, on the 62,000 exempted properties and what proportion of them could be made available to rent because people in practice no longer live in them?  Perhaps if the fair deal-style problem could be ironed out, a proportion of these houses could be made available to rent.  The Taoiseach regularly speaks of a whole-of-Government approach.  I put it to the witnesses that cross-departmental engagement on how some of these properties could be made available would be appropriate.

That is an alternative to a situation where Dublin prices would continue to rise and property tax would be very heavily skewed towards the capital, in a way that certainly would have equity issues.

As I mentioned in my opening remarks, in the last few years we have published more and more information.  Probably most significantly, we publish a ready reckoner and we update it in the run-up to the budget.  That ready reckoner shows a series of tax policy options, including the impact of increasing or decreasing universal social charge, USC, rates, and the impact of changing value added tax, VAT, rates.  It is pretty much those sorts of changes to rates, bands and thresholds for all of the major taxes.  We publish that on our website and it is available to everyone, including the Department of Finance.  Aside from that, we interact with the Department.  Sometimes in the run-up to the budget Department officials will simply look at the ready reckoner and will use the figures there.  Sometimes they will want clarifications or figures that are not exactly covered by the ready reckoner or they might want something to be refined or confirmed.  It is a little difficult to give a general answer, but we certainly have ongoing interactions with the Department of Finance on budgetary matters.  That starts well before the summer, before the tax strategy group papers, and continues all the way through the budget process into the Finance Bill.<\/p> <p>  I will now address the commercial stamp duty or non-residential property stamp duty change in the budget.  The increase provided for in the budget, from 2% to 6%, was shown in our ready reckoner.  The figure projected there, a &euro;376 million increase, was taken by the Department of Finance and accounted for in the budget.<\/p> <p>  I will explain where that figure comes from.  When we are trying to project stamp duty, there are three phases to our work.  First, we look back at the most recent year for which we have complete data, in this case it is 2016.  We look at 2016 to try to get an idea of the general taxable base during that year.  We try to factor out once-off revenues, because if they are once-off in nature they are not a good indicator for receipts in future years.  In 2016 in particular, we factored out a number of very significant once-off payments that inflated the tax base.   If we had not factored them out, we would have had a higher estimate for commercial stamp duty.<\/p> <p>  Looking at 2016 data is the first phase.  Then we look at 2017 data.  We try to see if the trends that we expected from 2016 have continued, and if there are changes we should be aware of.  Lastly, we look at the growth prospects based on the Department of Finance forecasts for 2018.  Based on that assessment of data from 2016, trends since then in 2017 and expectations for 2018, we formed a view that the taxable base for non-residential property for stamp duty purposes was around &euro;9 billion in the last several years.  The consistent or stable tax base is about that, and we think that will reoccur next year.  That is essentially the basis for the costing of the increase from 2% to 6%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017121200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Keith Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I would also like to ask about the changes on Report Stage concerning consanguinity arrangements for land.

The Deputy's first question was about the process involved.  When we were trying to figure out costings for budget 2018, we looked back over a three-year period.  Therefore, we looked at 2016 as the most recent complete year and tried to factor out once-off transactions.  In 2016 there were some significant transactions that when we reviewed them we deemed to be once-off.  I cannot say much about them for reasons of confidentiality because there were not that many.  However, this is a manual process where we examine the largest transactions to identify whether they are likely to recur or whether they are once-off or outliers of some kind.  The value of non-residential property transactions in 2016 was more than &euro;12 billion, but when we factored out what we thought were once-off transactions, the figure reduced to approximately &euro;9 million.  There were no major once-off transactions in 2014 and 2015.  The value of non-residential property transactions in both of those years was &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion.  One never knows what will happen in the future, but that is why I have some confidence that if we look at the three-year period 2014 to 2016, there is a steady rate of transactions when once-off transactions are excluded valued at &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion.

Without singling out any of them, the industry is slightly underestimating the value of transactions in recent years because when I compare the estimates the industry is putting out with what we are taking in in tax payments and hard cash, our figures are consistently higher over a three-year period.  For the first three quarters of 2017 the value of transactions was approximately &euro;6.5 billion.  If that trend continues in the fourth quarter, the yield will reach &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion.  We have three and a half or three and three quarter years of transactions in the market with a value of &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion, which suggests a certain level of consistency on which we can rely at least in the short term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017121200002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Keith Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Walsh clarify that to the best of his knowledge the Department did not come back to Revenue seeking clarifications or to have a conversation about this measure before it was introduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017121200002#H01200","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Not in terms of the costing.

At the outset I will give a picture of the industry which might not normally be appreciated.  In our industry, 97% of entities are very small players employing fewer than ten people.  The committee will see the big sites and big players but the bulk of the industry is small.  Small players have extra challenges in dealing with different issues.  The industry is in a pretty good place at the moment having come through a torrid time when it deteriorated to almost one quarter of its size with massive job losses, massive companies going out of business and so on.  The industry is growing now.  Generally when the economy is doing well the construction industry does well.  CSO figures suggest that for the past 30 months, we have employed an extra 1,000 people per month.  We have not heard the Minister or a Minister of State saying it is wonderful.  The industry has been taking people largely off the live register, including many foreign people.  Many people who were forced to leave the industry are coming back to take up good jobs again.  It is a very competitive industry and is very labour intensive.  Traditionally, it was very simple to look at the costs of building.  One employed labour and bought the materials and put them to work as efficiently as possible.  It was very straightforward.<\/p> <p>  I will go quickly through the tendering costs.  Practically all the work done, whether in the private or public sector, is put out to tender.  Very often the cost of tendering for projects is disproportionate to the probability of winning.  There might be a pre-qualification tender and six or eight people might pre-qualify who have to employ a fairly substantial team of surveyors, engineers, designers and so on.  Particularly if it is a design build, they have to go into a lot of detail in terms of coming up with the plans and so on.  There is only one winner, which has to be factored into the cost.  We have been negotiating with Government for more effective and fairer public works contracts.  We are making some progress there but there is still a lot of work to do.<\/p> <p>  Building and material costs are a big factor.  We had a decade of declining and flat building costs.  The wholesale price index recently showed that in the year up to December 2017 costs increased by 3.2%.  The most notable increase was glass, which went up by 21%.  Sand and gravel prices increased by 8.9%.  Stone prices increased by 7.8% and structural seal prices increased by 6%.  Timber pipe fittings also increased in price.  One of the biggest costs is insulation, which is a big factor in new quality builds now.  There has been big inflation in costs.  <\/p> <p>  Planning and development costs are another major issue.  Regulation has increased substantially in that area.  The whole process is extremely slow and expensive.  Lead-in times can be slowed down massively and that all adds to cost.  We have had some fairly positive amendments to planning legislation, including the fast-tracking of applications for developments with more than 100 housing units.  We have LIHAF and extension to planning permission in some cases.  It is still a major cost and can cause a big slow down.<\/p> <p>  The costs of building a house is a very big issue at the moment.  It can be divided between the cost of providing the house and building the house.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland recently did an in-depth survey of the cost of providing a house.  The hard construction costs are just 45% of the total costs.  Development finance, the cost of land, the design and taxation elements, levies, VAT and all of that are very big costs.  While I am saying there is inflation on the building side, it is still a small part of the overall cost.  We met with the IDA yesterday.  A big concern is the lack of quality apartments in Dublin particularly for the big workforce of foreign workers we have here.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is reviewing the proposals with regard to apartment building and he is looking at parking provision.  Previously one was obliged to put in very expensive underground parking.  With regard to lifting the height caps, we have very restricted height caps in the city centre.  With regard to build-to-rent policies, the dual aspect requirement is an issue.  One cannot build an apartment unless it looks out east and west or north and south.  There is also the issue of units per lift core.  That is practical stuff that we hopefully will get a positive view on.<\/p> <p>  Finance is a big cost and a big constraint on the industry.  Can the Chairman see the clock?  She is looking over my head.  Do I have time left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#D00300","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Finance is a major cost.  When the industry got into trouble ten years ago, the problem was the ease of getting finance.  Now it is a different story altogether.  We did a survey recently and despite the chronic under-supply of houses, 63% of our builders mentioned their difficulty in securing finance.  Senior debt is maxed at 60%.  No matter how good one's standing with the bank is, it will only give a maximum of 60% for a project.  Very often our members, after coming through ten hard years, do not have the balance sheet to fund much so they depend on mezzanine finance which is generally in double digit figures.  It can be up to 15% or 16%.  When that rate is blended it can be 8% or 9%.  It is a substantial cost.  The Government recognised this in the last budget and has talked about setting up home building finance Ireland, which will have a fund of &euro;750 million.  The details are being developed at the moment and we are in consultation on that.  If it came on a hare's back it would not come quickly enough because the industry needs access to that finance.<\/p> <p>  Labour is a big factor.  Generally across the board labour accounts for about 40% of the total cost of any project.  In October a sectoral employment order was written into law by the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen.  It provides a set standard rate for the different grades of skilled people across the country, which is good, and it means everyone has a level playing field.  It provides for a 10% increase in the rates as well, which is a very substantial increase that the industry has to live with.  It is adding to the costs.  There is also a scarcity of workers now.  Our unemployment rate has dropped substantially.  The number of potentially skilled people within the ranks of the unemployed is scarce.  There is a lot of competition for skilled people.  That is adding to inflation.  <\/p> <p>  Energy and transport costs are a factor.  Unfortunately, the bulk of construction work is happening within the M50 and the greater Dublin area.  Anyone who travels to and from the country, which I and many of the people around me do, will know there is a massive clogging of the roads with traffic.  Much of that is made up of construction workers with their vans and tools and their gear coming to work in Dublin.  That adds substantially to the cost.  Many of our firms have to provide vans for people because they commute long distances.  Unfortunately the option of living in Dublin is not a viable one.  That is probably another major player.<\/p> <p>  Construction and demolition waste is the next cost.  The new children's hospital is under construction.<\/p><p>The first part of this construction project involves the digging of a massive basement several storeys deep to accommodate services, plant and car parking.  All the material taken out will have to be disposed of.  There is a strict and highly regulated waste policy in place, and rightly so, because it is important for the environment.  The bulk of demolition waste has to travel up to 100 km outside the city for disposal.  One can imagine the cost of that, as well as travelling through congested traffic.  We are negotiating with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to reduce costs in this regard.<\/p><p> We all have to live with taxation.  However, the issue of VAT on residential housing is a thorny subject which we have raised with the Department of Finance for quite some time.  There is no VAT in Northern Ireland or the UK on housing.  However, in the Republic, there is a 13.5% VAT rate on houses, which adds &euro;40,000 to a typical &euro;300,000 starter home in Dublin.  Some of my colleagues beside me today negotiated a reduced VAT rate when the industry was in difficulty in the past and it appears to have worked extremely well.  A reduction of even &euro;10,000, 4.5% of the rate, would make a house much cheaper for a first-time buyer.<\/p><p> Our biggest concern is the cost of building residential apartment blocks.  We are currently building well in excess of 100 acres of office space.  This activity signifies 45,000 new construction jobs but we are not building homes for them.  We need to accelerate the building of apartment blocks.  One can secure viable finance to build an office block, a hotel or student accommodation but not for residential development.  The Taoiseach made a commitment at our annual conference this year that he would set up a construction sectorial group, which would embrace several different Departments and be chaired by his Department, to look into problems with costs which are making certain developments unviable.  The sooner that sectorial group is established the better.<\/p><p> It is not a tale of woe.  The industry is doing well.  However, we appreciate there is a void in the turnout of residential housing.  It is the viability of those and high costs associated with that which is the problem.  We will continue to underline those issues and see if we can make any policy changes in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Adrian Cummins of the Restaurants Association of Ireland to make his opening statement.

It would be remiss of me not to thank all Deputies and Senators for their continuous support for the 9% VAT rate for food and tourism attractions.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland has long advocated that the 9% VAT rate for food and tourism is the correct one when benchmarked against our European Union colleagues.  Since 2011, we have created over 50,000 jobs in our sector.  Many of these jobs are in rural communities where tourism is very often the only employer.<\/p> <p>  Today's discussion is around the cost of doing business.  It is widely known, with many reports outlining it, that Ireland is the costliest place in the European Union to open a business.  Over the past several years, insurance premiums for businesses and the public have rocketed.  In 2017, the average annual insurance premium for the restaurant sector rose by 45%.  This is unsustainable for any business, let alone our sector.  The problem lies squarely at the door of the insurance companies and the legal profession.  We would welcome a full and absolute investigation into the outrageous insurance premium increases over the past two years and why payouts to claimants have increased by 400% in the past five years.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board has been totally bypassed by the legal profession to maximise profit for its industry to the detriment of small businesses and the general consumer looking for insurance.  The time for action to deal with this issue is now.  Otherwise, our sector will be forced to source insurance from outside the jurisdiction for our industry.<\/p> <p>  Before a business opens its doors, local authority rates will be the first charge for that business.  Over one third of all local authority budgets come from commercial rates to the tune of just over &euro;1.5 billion per annum.  Small businesses, restaurants, coffee shops and pubs which serve food complain to our organisation that their commercial rates are not good value for money.  For a restaurant, the calculation of rates does not take into account the ability to pay, the size of the premises, profitability, numbers employed or location.  However, other licensed premises such as hotels and public houses are valued by reference to the trading data of their property.  When a small business receives its commercial rates bill for a year, why does the bill not show where exactly its commercial rates are spent?  Why is the payroll cost excluded from the percentage of the commercial rate given to a business?  This should be investigated by the committee.  Local authorities should be instructed to split out the payroll cost and it benchmarked between local authorities.<\/p> <p>  Water charges are another cost to small business which most consumers do not understand.  Harmonisation of water charges for all businesses must be a matter or priority.  Why do two counties, side by side, have the highest and lowest commercial water charges?  It does not make sense.<\/p> <p>  Business improvement district levies were brought in through primary legislation in 2006.  The levy is generally a 5% top-up on commercial rates, double taxation at its best.  The measure is in use in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Dundalk, Sligo, Sandyford and Dublin city centre but the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is advocating its roll-out across the country.  Business improvement districts are run by private companies and are outside the remits of the freedom of information legislation and the Standards in Public Office.  For example, in Dublin city centre, &euro;29 million was raised from this tax on businesses.  We would like the committee to investigate this levy.<\/p> <p>  Another bugbear of our industry is the famous sunshine tax, otherwise known as outdoor seating charges.  Outdoor seating charges are seen by businesses as a tax on their business.  There is no benchmark or uniformity of charging with regards to this tax with some local authorities maximising it for profit.  For example, for every &euro;1 spent by Dublin City Council administering the charge, &euro;4 is being raised from businesses.  This makes no sense to a small business and is another example of double taxation.<\/p> <p>  The fats, oils and grease trap charge for restaurants is an environmental charge with an average annual cost of &euro;1,000 per business.  It is another example of double taxation.  Any restaurant will have a minimum of 28 different licences, regulations or regulatory regimes with which it must legally comply.  We were advised in 2012 that work would be conducted by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to streamline inspections for all businesses, utilising technology and reducing paperwork and form filling.  For example, an environmental health officer could arrive in a restaurant in the morning to carry out a food safety audit.  However, he or she would not be allowed conduct an audit of fats, oils and grease trap standards, even though he or she would be fully qualified to do so.  That is two inspections, two regimes and two fees for that individual business.<\/p> <p>  Excise duty, specifically around wine, is the highest in Europe.<\/p><p>An increase in excise duty would be a retrograde step to the competitiveness of our sector.  Other forms of taxation for restaurants around copyright, music performance and motion picture licensing are a major concern.  We have three different organisations in Ireland collecting copyright fees from small businesses across the country in respect of three different types of copyright and these businesses must also have a standard television licence.<\/p><p> On the shortage of skilled labour in our sector, since 2012, the Restaurants Association of Ireland has been highlighting the shortage of chefs in this country.  I will explain the reason for the shortage of not only chefs but all skilled labour in the hospitality industry.  Each year, our colleges and institutes of technology qualify, on average, 1,800 chefs.  As per the 2015 expert skills report for hospitality conducted by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, we require 5,000 chefs per year to have a functioning hospitality industry.  The problem is that we do not have one organisation with sole responsibility for hospitality and tourism training policy in Ireland.  This problem arose with the dismantling of CERT, which was the State agency for hospitality training and management in 2003.  We are asking the committee for its support for the re-establishment of CERT or a small secretariat with responsibility for hospitality training policy and development in Ireland.  Until we have leadership, we have nothing and, unfortunately, decisions are being made by State organisations to spend taxpayers' money in a way that will not benefit our sector.  The tourism and hospitality industry is seeking this leadership as a matter of urgency.  If one compares the tourism and hospitality industry to the agricultural industry this is akin to the dismantling of Teagasc as the training authority for farmers.  Ireland is either serious about tourism and hospitality, or its not.  Unfortunately, the State agency for tourism development in Ireland, Failte Ireland, closed training centres around the country from 2010 to 2013 and it has no interest in re-entering the chef training space.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for listening to our concerns and we welcome any questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Cummins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cummins for his presentation and I invite Mr. Stapleton to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#F00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to outline the views of the IFA on the cost of doing business in Ireland.  I am chairman of the IFA national farm business committee.  I am joined today by Mr. Damian McDonald, IFA director general.  Mr. Joe Healy, president of the IFA, sends his apologies for not being here today but he had to go to Argentina for the Mercosur discussions.  I acknowledge the presence of our colleagues from the Restaurant Association of Ireland and the Construction Industry Federation, particularly our former president, Mr. Tom Parlon.<br\/><br\/>IFA is the representative organisation for over 70,000 members throughout the country and is the recognised voice of Irish farmers in Europe and internationally.  The association promotes the ongoing development and competitiveness of Irish agriculture and the food industry which is making an important contribution to Ireland's economic recovery.  Farming and the agrifood sector is Ireland's largest indigenous productive sector, exporting food and drink worth over &euro;11 billion in 2016 and providing employment to over 300,000 people directly and indirectly.  It has been a key driver in Ireland's economic recovery and it is the backbone of economic activity across the rural economy.  A strong agriculture sector is critical to the achievement of a more balanced economic recovery in this country.<br\/><br\/>Agriculture provides employment and generates earnings across the country not just at farm level but in the thousands of regionally based jobs dependent on and linked to the sector.  Many of these jobs are located outside of the main urban centres.  For those of us who live and work in rural Ireland, it is a really good place to live and work.  However, there are many challenges facing farmers, in particular the challenges of Brexit and CAP post 2020.  Consolidation of farm holdings and increasing the scale of farms are necessary to operate efficient and competitive businesses.  It is, therefore, important that this would be taken into consideration in the new review of agri-taxation measures due to commence in early 2018.  The IFA has identified key areas where barriers exist for farming enterprises to doing business.  First, access to credit at a competitive rate is critically important to support farm investment and improve efficiency.  There is an ongoing market failure within the Irish banking system which is placing Irish farmers at a competitive disadvantage to their EU counterparts.  The lack of competition between the financial institutions and the legacy of historical banking losses is resulting in higher interest rates being charged on new lending.  The high demand in 2017 for the agri cashflow loan scheme demonstrated the need for competitively priced working capital on Irish farms.  The funding of &euro;25 million in budget 2018 for a low-interest loan package for farmers provides some recognition of the market and income difficulties facing farming enterprises in 2017.  This fund needs to be rolled out as soon as possible.  The high costs of registering a legal charge is resulting in a barrier for customers to move between banking institutions, further contributing to a lack competition between the banks.  Another area of concern to farmers is the new Central Bank requirements around the valuation of farm land<b><\/b>that is being used to secure funds.  IFA understands that such valuations may have to be reviewed every two to three years, and that valuations must be obtained from a list of auctioneers selected by the bank.  This has the potential to add significant unnecessary cost to the finance being borrowed.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Second,<b><\/b>Ireland faces significant challenges in delivering on 2020 EU renewable energy and climate obligations, which may result in fines over &euro;400 million being imposed on Ireland.  Farm businesses are considerable users of energy.  In recent months, IFA has developed a clear strategy to displace fossil fuel use in the agriculture sector with energies from renewable sources.  In a recent submission to Government, the IFA called for 20% of the public service obligation, PSO, levy paid by all consumers, which is equivalent to &euro;100 million, to be ringfenced to support the development of farm scale, roof-mounted and farmer led community energy projects.  The current strategy of exclusively using this levy to support the construction of thousands of large-scale wind turbines across our natural landscape is no longer acceptable to rural communities.  It has also resulted in the transfer of millions of euros paid by Irish citizens to enrich multi-national energy companies.  The IFA's proposal to ringfence 20% of the PSO levy would contribute to energy savings for the sector by displacing fossil fuels and will, in turn, assist in addressing climate and renewable obligations.  Over time, the competition this would create among service providers must deliver further energy cost-savings for Irish businesses. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Third, a shortage in labour supply has emerged in the last number of years in the agriculture sector due to a number of factors, including the fall in unemployment in Ireland, which is leading to a labour supply shortage, particularly for lower paid employment.  This is particularly relevant for the horticulture sector.  There is an increased demand for skilled farm workers, particularly in the dairy sector, arising from the expansion in milk supply and the dairy herd since the abolition of milk quota in 2015.  A recent Teagasc survey indicates that there is potential for 6,000 extra jobs to be generated on dairy farms in the next few years.  The improvements in the economies of newer member states has reduced the supply of workers who have traditionally filled jobs in the horticulture sector since EU accession over a decade ago.  There is an increasing demand for skilled farm workers in the pigmeat and poultry sectors arising from increased output and increased scale in these operations.  The shortage of labour supply at farm level is restricting the ability of the sector to achieve its growth targets over the next decade.  We urgently need a scheme to facilitate the issuing of work permits to non-EU workers in the agriculture sector.  The IFA has raised this serious issue with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department is currently reviewing the criteria for non-EU work permits.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On the earned income tax credit, the failure of the Government to increase the earned income tax credit to match the PAYE credit to the level committed to in the programme for Government maintains the inequity in the income tax system between employees and the self-employed, including farmers.  The &euro;200 increase in the earned income tax credit does not go far enough.  The Government has chosen to continue the discrimination between employees and self-employed in the income tax system for yet another year.  It is simply not right that a farmer earning &euro;16,500 will be paying &euro;500 a year more in income tax than a person in employment.<\/p><p>It is simply not right that a farmer earning &euro;16,500 will pay &euro;500 a year more in income tax than a person in employment.  The Government has reneged on a clear commitment in the programme for Government that the PAYE and earned income tax credits will reach parity, at &euro;1,650, by 2018.<\/p><p> I refer to incentivising apprenticeships in rural SMEs.  A skills shortage is emerging due to the lack of availability of trade-based vocational training programmes.  The IFA recognises the commitment in the programme for Government to double the number of apprenticeships by 2020, with a significant increase in the number of traineeship places and the development of a mechanism to recognise a person&rsquo;s practical work experience and expertise to qualify him or her to take on an apprentice.  The IFA has proposed to the Government that SOLAS and the Apprenticeship Council should target a specific number of apprenticeship places and provide the supports required for small business employers who take on apprentices in an approved programme.<\/p><p> With regard to the rural fibre broadband network, while some progress has been made, the Government needs to swiftly conclude the tendering process for the new rural broadband scheme.  It must ensure every home, school, farm and business in rural Ireland will have access to high-speed fibre broadband, no matter where they are located.<\/p><p> The vast majority of rural businesses are micro-enterprises, employing ten or fewer people.  These businesses struggle with administrative costs and regulations which often act as a disincentive to increasing the number of employees.  The IFA has a number of recommendations to make to address these issues.  The Leader programme has an important role to play in supporting enterprise development and job creation in rural Ireland.  However, the current programme is proving to be inappropriate for administering and progressing the approval of project funding.  The Government needs to undertake a review of the application process for Leader funding, with the target of simplifying the process for applicants and significantly reducing the turnaround time between project proposal and approval.  In addition, a review needs to be undertaken of the new local community development companies, LCDC, structures at local authority level to determine what their impact has been to date.<\/p><p> The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, as Ireland&rsquo;s independent energy and water services regulator, has important economic and customer protection responsibilities.  The timelag in reducing retail energy prices when wholesale prices are declining is a significant source of concern for farmers.  We call on the committee to consider granting legislative powers to the CRU to intervene in energy pricing policy where it is clear that wholesale price savings are not being passed on businesses and domestic consumers.<\/p><p> Insurance and transport are two sectors that need to be monitored to maintain competitiveness.  I hope what I have outlined demonstrates some of the key areas where farmers find difficulty and meet barriers in their day-to-day farming activities which prevents them from doing business in the most efficient way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Stapleton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I thank all three delegations for their submissions.

What refusal rate are they experiencing?<\/p> <p>  Water charges are linked with the issue of commercial rates which has been mentioned by other groups that have appeared before the joint committee.  Local authorities vary the rates hugely, which impacts on farming, as well as business.  The delegates have said they are seeking uniformity, which makes sense.  Are they looking for the pricing model to be transferred to the new utility regulator?  In doing so, they need to be mindful that their members will experience a lift in the areas of the local authorities that charge less if the rates are averaged out.<\/p> <p>  The upcoming legislation to amend the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 has been flagged by a number of groups, including at last week's meeting.

No matter where one goes in Ireland, there are people from every corner of Europe working in the construction sector.  We do not see it as an issue.  We have got back approximately half of the professional and skilled workers we lost and we are still encouraging others to come back.  The big issue in the construction sector is taking advantage of new technology and faster ways of engaging in off-site production and so on.  The amount of labouring work done on a site is much lower than it ever was.<\/p> <p>  With regard to water services, the issue for the construction industry is securing a water supply connection.  There is quite a delay in that regard.  When our house builders sit down to engage in internal discussions with the IHBA, they are more agitated by the difficulty in securing connections with the ESB or Irish Water than by other issues because it is a nightmare.  For an individual unit, it costs &euro;5,000 up front to have a water supply connected.  That is a direct cost which is passed on to the first-time buyer.  An ESB connection costs much less as customers will continue to pay on a monthly basis though their electricity bill.<\/p> <p>  We know from our recent discussions with IDA Ireland and our big players who deal directly with FDI and other infrastructural projects that the planning process is horrendous.  I am annoyed most by the respect afforded to vexatious objectors who live 100 miles away from a proposed project and choose to throw their oar in.  When the proposed amendment to Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 is examined, that factor has to be taken into account.  Clearly, people who have genuine objections and concerns about a future development have a right to express them.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this week I attended the launch in Grangegorman of the new apprenticeship scheme by the Minister for Education and Skills.  The bulk of the apprenticeships are not in the construction sector.  We still have a good pipeline of fitters, plumbers and electricians coming through, but the number with wet skills such as block laying and plastering is scarce.  The intensive house building that will have to happen in the next few years will be a struggle.  It will be difficult because we are competing for workers with farming and the hotel and catering industries.  I have read commentary that workers are leaving these sectors to work in the construction industry because our pay rates are substantially higher, but that is putting pressure on the industry because we are subject to a sectoral employment order.  We used to have a registered employment agreement to set pay rates, but now we have a sectoral employment order.  The Minister made a commitment to direct 20% of school leavers to apprenticeships in the next few years.<\/p><p>It is a major challenge to get those school leavers into apprenticeships because the system has been designed to encourage them to move towards third level colleges.  Third level colleges have a vested interest in attracting them because they are their bread and butter.  However, that has led to many square pegs being put in round holes.  If someone wants to enter an apprenticeship, he or she must first find an employer and go through his or her local SOLAS office and so on.  Many changes could be made to make apprenticeships more attractive.  A challenge for our industry and others is encouraging people to enter it.  It is very positive for young people coming out of school and so on that they have choices.  Our challenge is to sell the construction industry as one which offers a good long-term career to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I will start by addressing the issue of work permits.  We have made a submission on work permits to the Department every six months since 2010 during the window of opportunity and each has been refused because the Department does not want to deal with the issue of work permits for our sector.  Some 210 were received in the sector in 2016, but the road haulage industry, a far smaller sector, received 350.  New Zealand which is of a similar size to Ireland has a functioning work permit system involving a two-year permit.  It targets specific countries to attract skilled labour in a similar manner to how many nurses in the health care sector in Ireland come from the Philippines.  The same could be done in our sector if we followed a similar system to that in place in New Zealand, involving a quota system for 1,000 people in the hospitality industry which would be cut off for two years.  The country is approaching full employment and our industry is crying out for staff.  There are the same issues across Europe in terms of the need for skilled labour.<br\/><br\/>Our industry will benefit from the commis chef programme, one of the new apprenticeship programmes.  It is to be welcomed that it was picked as one of the new programmes and that it was recognised that it should be developed.  That is the only good thing about it.  There is a very poor take-up and very poor marketing of apprenticeships outside the construction industry in Ireland and a proper marketing programme must be developed in that regard.  In terms of how it is structured, organisations such as F&Aacute;S and its replacement, SOLAS, do not have expertise in certain sectors.  They were heavily involved in the trades and construction industry, but the hospitality sector is very new to them.  A sufficient level of expertise was and is not present in these organisations.Education and training boards are not hospitality trainers<i>per se<\/i>.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland which previously had responsibility for hospitality training has ceased to provide it, even though the legislation states it must do so.  It is not doing what it is supposed to be doing.<br\/><br\/>I take Deputy Niall Collins' point on the harmonisation of water charges.

For the past ten to 15 years Irish farms have been given a supply of workers from eastern and south eastern European countries, but that supply is no longer sufficient to match demand.  Like my colleagues, we have hit a stone wall in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in getting permits to bring people in.  The downside is that it will limit the capacity of our industry to grow in accordance with the projections made.<\/p> <p>  On apprenticeships, we need a pathway for people to enter agriculture, to secure an apprenticeship to become trained managers and have an opportunity to go on and become farm business owners, which is different from the low-skilled workers we are hoping to bring in from outside Europe.  That can only be done through having a proper apprenticeship scheme in place.  An opportunity is needed to set it up whereby people would be incentivised and given the wherewithal to take on apprentices in order that they would be able to build a career in the farming sector and have an opportunity to fulfil their ambitions.<\/p> <p>  As regards water charges, it is about harmonisation and making sure everybody gets fair play.  It is a source of particular frustration that those involved in community water schemes are still paying for water, which is not fair.  I do not know how long Deputies and Senators will allow that to continue, but it is unfair that although water charges have been rescinded for everyone else, those involved in community water schemes still have to pay.  Most of those involved in large-scale farm businesses use their own well water, which involves a significant cost in pumping and supply, but it is more competitive than having to pay for community water schemes.  Those whose farms are fragmented often have to pay for the connection of two, three or four water meters.  If one is connected to the supply line, one should only have to pay for one connection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Stapleton"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>On a point of clarification, what other items of significant infrastructure would the delegates like to see under the Strategic Infrastructure Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#H00400","speaker":"1221"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":306,"content":"<p>Motorways are key.

Reference was made to the issue of supply and demand for hotel accommodation in Dublin city where there is not enough supply and too much demand.  However, the opposite is the case in much of rural Ireland.  There is a fear among restaurants owners about increasing prices for consumers.  Many restaurant owners have been soaking up their overheads to stay competitive and in business, and their profit margins have been decreasing.  There is a fear among them, if they increase their prices, about whether consumers will still frequent them. We are monitoring the competition all the time.  At this stage, I believe the consumer will see an increase in prices.  We cannot do anything about that.  We have to stay in business and maintain employment.  It will not be anything of the order of the increase in hotel prices but there will be a creep up in prices because we have to stay in business.  That is affecting rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We have seen the immediate effect of Brexit in the off season.  Many small towns in rural Ireland have lost business from short trip visitors from the United Kingdom.  That has been lost.  The peak season was very good in Ireland.  The number of American visitors was exceptional.  We did not feel the effect of Brexit in the peak season, but in the off season we felt it straight away.  I live in Kinsale, and if one was to go into the town tonight, one would find that 70% of the restaurants would be closed.  We do not have the volume.

There are a number of issues, which Mr. Parlon outlined, around some of the reasons the viability of apartment developments, particularly in the Dublin area, is fairly limited such as the building height, the number of lift cores per floor and issues around dual aspect.  It is to be hoped the working group of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will examine that and come up with solutions to amend the 2015 guidelines for apartments.  On the other hand, there is the investment side.  With the change in the types of tenure among apartment dwellers within the city and across most urban centres in Europe and the world, an increasing focus on urbanisation and the requirement for a change of tenure, we are moving to a build-to-rent model.<\/p> <p>  Current providers of housing within the urban centres are largely focused on housing units, three-bedroomed developments and so on.  Even where large developments of apartments are taking place, they are often being built by larger companies, and even where they are able to pre-sell some units, it is being done on a phased basis.  One of the problems about getting the finance in place to undertake the significant site infrastructure works that are needed to begin to develop an apartment building of significance, say, within the city area, is that there are site restriction issues, accessibility, and all the site infrastructure works that have to take place.  Developers have to put together a model which their lenders will support.  Lenders which are currently in that space come from international sources largely and some international firms are operating in this area.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Parlon mentioned, we have received large investment in commercial office space, the hotel sector and student accommodation.  Unfortunately, there has not been the same appetite to invest in the residential sector, although it is changing.  There is also the matter of the viability of being able to build units that a developer will know will be rented or possibly sold.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to pre-sell apartments.  Even within housing developments, very liquid builders are only getting the finance to build ten or 20 houses at a time.  They must have contracts signed and agreements in place before they will be given the next amount of development finance to proceed with the remainder of the phase in a development.  That is the current environment, but obviously market demands will probably dictate that.  We will slowly see a maturing sector within the construction industry moving into that space in time.  It is to be hoped the amendment of the standards, if that is to happen by the end of the year as promised by the Minister and the Department, will go some way to aiding the build prospects and the viability of entering into that, which is quite a high-risk investment in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jeanette Mair"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.

They will come and walk one's land and visit one's business to understand one's model.  It has a very much a personal approach and is run through offices in a region.  There is talk of perhaps the credit unions collaborating with it, but we do not know if that will happen.  Would the witnesses welcome such a model and the capacity to access finance in a more face-to-face fashion?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses' issues around insurance costs are well made and everybody who has come to this committee has made the same point.  We had representatives of the insurance industry at our last meeting and we agreed that we will have them back for a more robust exchange.  I am particularly interested in what one of the representatives of the Restaurants Association Ireland said about going outside the country to look at other possibilities.  I would welcome that because that is what is needed to shake up the industry here.  Nobody can understand why the costs have gone up.  There are always rationale, reasons, legal costs etc., but nonetheless we heard of one small restaurant-food company in Galway whose insurance was &euro;10,000 ten years ago and it is now &euro;110,000 and little has changed.  We are all very much concerned about that.  As an aside, I would mention where the reverse occurred years ago when GPs in this country found it ridiculously expensive to be insured by English companies and we set up our own company.  While the restaurants association will possibly be doing the reverse, more competition is needed in the insurance sector.<\/p> <p>  How would the witnesses address the Irish Music Rights Organisation, IMRO issue in regard to that?  I would agree with comments made by people around greater transparency on how rates are spent.  I would not have an issue with that.<\/p> <p>  On the labour shortage, I would point to the number of people who had jobs in the agriculture industry that were created in 2011, 2012 and 2013 as the building sector was collapsing.  Many people who had been engaged in farming had gone into the building sector and then moved from it back to farming and now the building sector is struggling to attract people back.  Nobody has mentioned the minium wage but they have mentioned labour costs.  We will need to have wages competition to attract people into any element of labour, whether it be in the building sector or restaurant sector.<\/p><p>Work permits etc. are an issue that we have dealt with here under a different guise where there was ferocious abuse.  Will the witnesses comment on how they would protect people from that?  We have had plenty of stories here of people having passports taken from them and basically living a life of indenture.<br\/><br\/>I am interested in the apprenticeship issue.  I think we place far too much importance on going to university.  In these other trades, people make as much money or more money and have as good a life and they are just as critical to the well-being of our society as any university degree.  How would the IFA communicate to us or the powers that be in educational facilities its needs <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>where it sees a need for apprenticeships?  The same goes for the building trade and the restaurant industry.<br\/><br\/>I will comment on the issues with renewable energy.  It has always struck me that we have all these amazing agricultural buildings with roof space and we are not using it for solar energy and photovoltaics.  There are newer possibilities too.  We have asked the Minister for regulations because a number of local authorities have declined planning for farms for solar energy on the basis that there are no national guidelines.  My main question to the witnesses is about the finance issue and what their feelings would be if there were a third banking force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#J00700","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I will take that.  We would welcome it.  Having grown up in a post office, I think that would have been a prime opportunity to have had a post office outlet as a point of contact for a third banking force.  It might be a missed opportunity.  It could possibly include credit unions too.  We have set up our own microfinance.  We have a &euro;30 million fund for peer-to-peer lending through grid finance.  It is a form of leasing for our industry.  If a restaurant wants to lease equipment, the payback is through credit card payments per day based on its levels of business.  If it takes in &euro;1,000 in a night, it will pay 10% of &euro;1,000 as opposed to having a flat fee across the year.<\/p> <p>  The national minimum wage will go up in January.  We have wage inflation.  The Low Pay Commission looks at it but I think this morning's report from the National Competitiveness Council has raised red flags about competitiveness, and wage costs are part and parcel of that.<\/p> <p>  On work permits and the abuse of work permits, we fully endorse that the laws should be adhered to and anyone found in breach of those should be prosecuted.  The Oireachtas could bring in what is called a trusted partner scheme for work permits.  That is where companies such as Google or other large tech companies are seen as trusted partners, whereas small microenterprises are not allowed into that because of scale.  It is easy for the Department to deal with one large organisation that has 1,000 people working in it as opposed to dealing with a small to medium-sized enterprise with ten people that is trying to find one staff member.  We need to look at that and roll it out.  When a company is seen as a trusted partner, it is allowed to get permits fast-tracked, but if it steps outside the scheme, its trusted partner award is taken off it so it may not be able to look for a work permit in the future.

It is clear to us that rates are, on average, approximately 2% higher in Ireland than they are in north-western Europe and those are the people we compete with on the European market.  It is a significant charge.  There are different types of finance, as I am sure the committee knows, including finance for capital investment, for increasing the size and scale of a farm and purchasing land, and for working capital.  On the question of Sparkassen, we would welcome its participation in the Irish market to provide a new source of funds.  The most important part is that if Sparkassen is to come here, it will have to be competitive.  It will have to help drive down rates.  The funding model for Sparkassen may mean that it will not be available for long-term capital investment but it should certainly be a big help at the level we are talking about with working capital.  Traditionally and currently, banks' overdraft rates are between 7% and 9% and merchant credit is often charged at as high a rate as 1% a month, which is compounded to 13% to 13.5%.  Any time that we see an opportunity to increase competition in this market is a benefit not only for our sector but for all of our economy.  That has to be seen as being a good thing.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Senator about renewable energy.  The time has come for investment at farm level to produce renewable energy in this country.  For far too long, we have let our contribution or investment into renewable energy be put into huge companies.  One can see that with wind farms.  It is also the case with solar panel development where solar farms at the moment are run by big businesses where farms have been leased long-term and solar panels have been installed.  It would be innovative for us to incentivise farmers to put solar panels on the roof and to get involved in community projects such as putting in anaerobic digestion which has the potential to reduce our carbon output significantly and so allow farmers to play their part in meeting our renewable targets.  I will defer to Mr. McDonald.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Stapleton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>On the work permit issue, there were obviously bad experiences before in how work permits were operating and nobody wants to be associated or to have anything to do with that type of behaviour.  This is an issue we will have to grasp.  As some speakers have said, even if we were to roll it out on a fixed number basis for a start, there are models that could be looked at.  A seasonal horticultural workers scheme operated before where workers came in and were placed through a body, which was Macra na Feirme at the time, that was authorised by the Department to provide oversight to the scheme.  It brought in the workers and placed them on farms.  If there were issues, that organisation could intercede in those and make sure that if workers had any problems, they had options to come back into the system and be moved to another farm.  Problems arose where somebody was tied to a particular employer as a condition of getting his or her work permit.  That works in most cases, but unfortunately the bad cases get highlighted.<\/p> <p>  We are open to looking at innovative ideas to do this but it is a nettle that we have to grasp quickly because it is an increasing problem in our sector and in other sectors as well.  We had more positive engagement by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation when we last met but we need to get on with it.  I know that farms face huge problems this spring, particularly dairy farms.  In our sector, cows have to be milked.  We are dealing with animals.  Some businesses can close down for the summer.  For example, a construction business might not build an extra unit.  In our case, however, we have cows, they will calve, milk will be produced and, even from a farm safety perspective, relief labour is a huge issue on farms now.  Something could be done pretty quickly with a bit of innovative thinking, and mechanisms to give additional safeguards are available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian McDonald"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>The lack of finance and its cost are major factors in the construction industry that are holding up the necessary residential building.  I have met Sparkassen and its model looks good.  I can understand that our Government has a vested interest in allowing the pillar banks to rebuild their balance sheets, but it should not be at the cost of a chronic undersupply of housing with all the social and other effects.  One of the latest reports of the Central Bank stated that Irish households have more than &euro;100 billion on deposit.  We feel we are a very indebted country, but there is &euro;8.2 billion more in deposits than there is in loans to households at the moment.  There is a wall of cash there.  The credit unions are awash with cash, or all of the good ones at any rate.  Unfortunately, a few have difficulties, but they are a minority.  A friend of mine works in a credit union in a very small country town which I was astonished to discover has more than &euro;30 million.  His job is to find someone who can take a loan.  The credit unions are very restricted in what they can do and they have to lodge their deposits in pillar banks which charge them for minding their cache of money.<br\/><br\/>The challenge for this committee and for all of us will be to find a way to release the money.  Representatives of foreign funds telephone me every other day asking how they can provide funding.  When I ask more, they are all looking for quite high interest rates.  However, there is a large amount of cash around and there is a need to use that cash for infrastructure.  I know that our Government is restricted by the fiscal rules in what it can borrow for our capital programme.  I think there will be some flexibility there.  There is a new vice president of the European Investment Bank and that bank is highly active in lending to our semi-State companies and is keen to invest money<b>, <\/b>but obviously the fiscal rules are restrictive.<br\/><br\/>This is a big challenge for us, right across the board.

One thing we have to ensure is that our long-term unemployed have an opportunity to get back into the workforce.  I compliment Mr. Parlon and his association on their engagement with the local employment service, LES, in focusing on upskilling and training people who have been out of the workforce for a long period.  A lot of that has been done in the inner city.  I must say, not everyone has been as good.  I have seen quite a few blank faces when I have tried to discuss access for the long-term unemployed and for older people, that is, those over 50 years of age.  There seems to be a resistance in those organisations to seeing those people as possible good employees.  However, I compliment Mr. Parlon on the work his organisation has done in partnership with the LES, and I encourage other organisations to copy some of its initiatives.<\/p> <p>  Where apartments are concerned, the issue is one of quality.  I am still dealing with the problems of the 2000s when so-called reputable developers left mayhem and destruction across this city with so-called quality-built apartments featuring cold bridging or downright dangerous construction.  I am still living with the problems, and so are the residents.  We cannot go back there.  I totally accept that finance is a factor and has to be dealt with.  In the construction industry, I am slightly nervous about finance.  We should start looking at equity uptake rather than opting for 90% and 100% borrowings as we did in the 1980s.  Sometimes we hear that sound very loudly.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions about business improvement districts, BIDs.  Having worked on the business improvement districts, I would urge people to be careful with their language.  The ratepayers were given a full list of services provided by the local authority, down to the number of times a stop sign on a particular street would be cleaned.  The business improvement district scheme consisted of additional services on top of that.  That was my experience of BIDs.  That was the contract arrived at.  The additional levy was for additional services.  There may have been a problem during the recession, when the council could not provide the basics, but we need to return to that.  The extra payment in a business improvement district should provide additional services.  In Dublin city, that extensive consultation document is still there, so we should get the local authority to fulfil its side of the contract.<\/p> <p>  I must also ask about sunshine tax.  I live in the city centre.  Outdoor tables can be a blessing and also a disaster.  I like outdoor tables for reasons of passive policing and things like that.  It is all counted as additional services.  However, in the part of the city in which I live, a charge is normally applied for the renting of space in a public area.  I would not deem it a tax if a business is renting public space to put tables out.  I do not count that as a tax.  It is a business proposition.  The business is renting the space, for use as a commercial entity, from the citizens of the city through the local authority.  It is referred to as a sunshine tax, but I do not buy into language like that.  We have to be honest, precise and fair with each other.  The charge should reflect the possible business return on that table.  Accordingly, I would agree with Mr. Cummins on standardisation.  Outdoor seating has different economic returns in Kildare town and in Dublin, and that should be reflected in different charges.<\/p> <p>  I totally accept the point on water charges and their equalisation.  All organisations must be honest with their membership and with citizens and small businesses.  In many cases that will mean an increase in water charges for small businesses.  That is the reality.  Some of those will be the most vulnerable small businesses.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Parlon has advocated the 9% VAT rate for the construction industry for a long time.  I often listen to my colleagues, and the biggest argument is that if a 9% VAT rate is introduced as a temporary measure, the rate will never go back up again, as we saw in the hospitality sector.  I supported the 9% VAT rate in hospitality when it was introduced as a targeted measure, and I think it worked as such.  It now needs to be refined further.  Hundreds of millions of euro in tax has been forgone to assist the hospitality sector.  Some of that sector no longer needs that targeted intervention, yet some other areas do, such as rural Ireland.  With regard to the hospitality sector, I would be interested to know if there is a way of targeting that forgone tax to particular areas that are in trouble.  Some restaurants in the capital are doing extremely well, and their prices have not been controlled.  I have seen restaurants not too far from Mr. Parlon increase prices by 20% or 25%.  Mr. Parlon has probably paid the prices himself when visiting.<\/p> <p>  Something that costs hundreds of millions of euros in forgone taxes must be targeted properly.  I am not talking about a reduction in assistance to the industry.  However, in the hospitality sector, I would certainly like to see that forgone tax targeted to assist businesses that are still being challenged by Brexit and the performance of the American market, which has suffered.  If we consider how best to spend hundreds of millions of euros in forgone tax, I am not too sure that the 9% VAT rate is the proper way to assist the industry.  We need to target it much better, and speaking as a Senator that comes from Dublin, we must target it to assist industries outside of Dublin.<\/p> <p>  I remember being lobbied extremely hard on visas when I was a Minister of State.  Since I had access to the information, I enquired about the number of people with the required skill sets in a particular sector of the industry.  Those skill sets were available.  Suitable people were on the live register and their skill sets were still new.  As the recovery kicks in, we must ensure that those who lost their jobs at the beginning of the recession have an opportunity to get back into employment.  I will give Mr. Parlon credit where it is due.  The construction industry has stepped up in that area, but not all the industries have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#L00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>In 2013 we engaged with the MOMENTUM initiative, a good project, which dealt with long-term unemployment.

I accept there are EU rules on VAT.  However, if one puts the value of the 9% rate in real terms it comes to hundreds of millions of euro.  If the rate were returned to 13.5%, it would yield between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million. In turn, that could be spent in a more targeted manner in assisting growth in the tourism industry in rural areas.  For example, assistance required by Border counties to deal with Brexit issues or investment in the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East could come from this tax take.  We have to be much smarter in how we spend our money to make the best hit.<\/p> <p>  There are hotels near where I live which are running at a 92% occupancy rate and management have to put on a night-time shift to turn rooms around.  However, that is not happening across the country.  The hotel in Dublin with 92% occupancy rates is benefiting from this foregone tax yield when hotels in west Cork or Clare may need targeted financial assistance to ensure they can stay open.  We may have to be more intelligent in how we spend a foregone tax of &euro;600 million.

There is a mixture of permanent, part-time and casual staff and flexibility arrangements in the sector.  When I worked in the hospitality industry my co-workers and I were on minimum wage.  Has there been any industry pressure on employers to consider productivity?  Productivity has increased in recent years with the improvement in the economy, which has created staff shortages.  The sector has hit a kind of ceiling but productivity has increased and I assume that, for some organisations, profits have also increased.  Companies are out of the situation they were in during 2011 and 2012, if they were lucky enough to survive those years.

Could that be pushed back onto Government to make that happen because in education there is an increasing consideration of apprenticeships, broadening apprenticeships and moving towards the German model, which provides a broad range of apprenticeships, and growing that part of the economy?  That was neglected in the past, both culturally and by Government.  From a dairy farming point of view, and as one who worked on a dairy farm in my younger years, what is the minimum requirement for a person to be employed on a dairy farm who does not necessarily wish to pursue it as a career?  Has any thought been put into putting training modules or courses in place that could be run through Teagasc or a similar organisation but would have Government backing, or any way to expand in that regard in order to incentivise staff to come in?

The new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, have been in place since 2014 and set a very strict statutory certification whereby every build, be it a single house, extension or any other scale of construction, must have an assigned certifier with insurance cover who must be a chartered surveyor, chartered engineer or an architect and must sign off on all aspects of the build.  We have moved on, as we clearly needed to do, and we are in a good place.  The industry, together with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, has set up the construction industry register of Ireland, CIRI.  That means that in order to be a construction professional or involved in any element of the sector one must be registered and tick all the boxes with regard to one's experience, quality, insurance, tax compliance and so on, which will take the cowboys out of the industry, who, unfortunately, were among those involved in such poor-quality work, which was also due to the lack of implementation and scrutiny of the regulations at the time.<\/p> <p>  As regards the 9% rate, I understand exactly where finance comes from.  It annoys me that the calculation is done and it is said that if 4.5% VAT is taken from the industry whatever number of hundred million euro will have to be found.  However, that does not take into account that construction, in particular residential building, is a massive economic boost for the Exchequer.  Almost 40% of the cost of a house goes directly to the Exchequer and the extra cost, therefore, would be less than is represented.  As regards it being a temporary measure, I appreciate that has been a problem.  In fairness to my colleagues from the Restaurants Association of Ireland, they are holding on very strongly to the 9% rate.  It has been said on many occasions that a particular year would be the last year for the 9% rate but woe betide the Minister who follows through on that.  He or she would need to be fairly well galvanised or would not want to be going out for a meal around the country for a while.  That is a problem but we need to be innovative about how it will be done.  The issue about targeting is a difficulty because the EU lays down the rules and one either does or does not do it.  The Government is quite entitled to target the construction side for a 9% rate as it would qualify in the same manner as the hospitality sector.  However, we have to be innovative and find a way that we can do it temporarily or otherwise.  If there was a window of opportunity of two years, for example, we would make a major dent in the housing deficit.<\/p> <p>  As regards the point made by Deputy Neville on seeking finance from the private sector, the banks are senior debt and our bigger players are able to get into joint ventures.  Many houses are currently being turned out with the support of NAMA and others have many of the big international funds behind them but smaller players do not have that capacity.  As I stated, the bulk of our members around the country who are employing fewer than ten people do not have the capacity to link up with a big player and that is where the &euro;750 million the Government has now set aside or is about to set up will play into their hands.  The difficulty is that the banks which provide the 60% maximum have the deeds and the security on the project and the next player coming in does not have that comfort and, therefore, feels obliged to take a far higher cut in terms of an interest rate and so on and that is a difficulty.  The &euro;750 million house building finance envisages lending up to 80%.  There has been some speculation about interest rates in that regard but the Taoiseach said he expects it to be approximately 4%, which would be affordable for the industry and would give it a good boost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Parlon"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I have a question before I let Deputy Neville back in on this issue.

There are multiple issues around housing delivery but, through the Rebuilding Ireland programme, the Department has done significant work to put better structures in place.  There are still issues at local planning authority level, which we have touched on, including delays at the pre-planning stage.  There are delays before developers even get to site.  The delay is not related to being on site when everything is ready and the houses can be built.  The LIHAF was a welcome Government initiative.  It was oversubscribed when more than &euro;200 million was allocated to it originally.  Budget 2018 allocated a further &euro;75 million to the fund, which was hugely welcomed by local authorities and the building sector which are working in partnership and employing civil engineering contractors and so on to open up the lands.  Planning permission for a housing development will not be granted until the wastewater treatment plant or access roads are in place.  The problem with housing delivery is that it takes time.  The resourcing from administration through to planners at local authority level should be a significant focus of the committee, as it is a significant focus of the Department.  There has been a ramping up of resources in respect of planning and building standards throughout the local government sector.  That is one of the major delay factors.  I acknowledge there is debate in the media and so on around the statistics we use and the ESB connections which give us our completion figures.  Completions are increasing and, more important, commencements increased to approximately 15,000 for the first ten months of this year, which is a 45% increase on 2016.  We are on course to deliver approximately 18,500 houses this year and that will increase, according to our forecast, to 22,500 next year.  We are incrementally increasing annual housing supply to the 25,000 homes the ESRI estimates that we need.  The national planning framework has clear guidelines relating to where housing projects and population increases will be located up to 2040.  We need in the region of 550,000 new homes.  What is not mentioned is the pent-up demand and the additional supply that will have to come on stream over the next five years, particularly around some urban centres.  Planning permissions have increased and supply will improve significantly but it will all not come on stream this year.  Supply will increase incrementally over the next few years and, hopefully, by 2021, we should be up at the level of house building we need to be at to maintain supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jeanette Mair"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I have a supplementary question relating to finance and the private sector.

The average number of staff in a small business in our sector is 15 full-time equivalents.  It is usually busy between Thursday night and Sunday afternoon, which is a short window to maximise profit at the end of the day.  Businesses tend towards casual labour at the weekend, usually students or those looking for part-time work.  Many of our businesses do not open on Monday or Tuesday because it is not worth their while opening.  Many also close on Sunday evenings.  The committee is examining the cost of doing business and we need to examine how we can reduce costs and give people more work.  According to our balance sheet, 36% of expenditure is on payroll and that is the average throughout the industry.  If payroll costs exceed 36%, one is entering the drop zone of a non-profitable business.  Our businesses are people businesses and customers will vote their feet.  They expect good service and they expect to meet good staff.  We are not into lean technology similar to a manufacturing plant.  We are different from other sectors.  It is about utilising people in our business but we have to make a profit at the end of the day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Cummins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1513094400,"counter":362,"content":"<p>The RAI's big gripe with EHOs is the inconsistencies in their reports.

A lot of chefs have taken on kitchen porters and trained them slowly to become commis chefs or second chefs.  Many become fully qualified chefs and some even have their own businesses.  The other success has been chef-owners who, because there was a shortage of skills, decided they would own their own restaurants.  That is what Mr. Cummins spoke about.  When restaurants close on Mondays and Tuesdays, it is because a lot of chef-owners make a life choice to close on a Monday and Tuesday and to give all their staff those days off so they are all refreshed coming back on Wednesday.

It ties in perfectly with Deputy Neville's question.  Dairy, horticulture, pigs and poultry are the sectors that have the opportunity to grow their businesses.  There is a different skill set required and a different level of skills shortages.  Deputy Neville asked about dairy farming and referred to it being the backbone or his constituency.  Up until 1 January 2015, there was a milk quota.  For 30 years there was no increase in demand and a good deal of potential built up in the system.  Over the past three years, we have seen that potential used up.  We have gone from capacity to a deficit of skilled workers.  It is not new.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has set up a working group under Tom Moran to see how the skills shortage can be rectified.  It put in place a pilot project which operated in Kilkenny.  The last I heard five people have been taken off the live register.  Its aim was to take people off the live register and train them to milk cows.  I am not sure if the people who are on the live register right now have the potential, skills or interest in taking up milking cows as a career.  As farmers, we are interested in taking on workers and building a career for them in our businesses but we have to take into account that we have significant challenges as employers.  Much of our work is seasonal.  In dairy farms, it is around calving and breeding time.  Where crops are growing, whether grain or horticulture crops, the big demand is around harvest time so it is seasonal.  It is the nature of farming.  By and large, it is a low-margin business, which means many of our employers struggle to match minimum wage requirements.  They have to try to match the employment they can offer with their ability to pay for it.  There is more work available to people than our businesses generate the capacity to pay for.  We have to manage and balance that.  The type of skills shortage we have is on two levels.  It occurs with the general operatives who do the basic work on a daily basis and within that there is relief work.  There are farmers who end up working 80 or 90 hours a week at busy times.  It is a challenge from a health and safety point of view.  It is also a challenge from an animal welfare point of view to make sure there is enough capacity to get those animals managed.  That is one side of it.  There is a shortage that is starting to impact on the potential of the business to achieve what it can for us as farmers and for the economy.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the issue of apprenticeships, there will be a shortage of future managers and business owners and we need to have a roadway for those people.  The first step is to create apprenticeships, to find a way of assessing farmers and to treat them as potential trainers for the future so that when new people go on to farms run with really good, efficient, modern technology, they will come out after one, two or three years with a certificate or qualification to show what they have done.  It will provide those people with a pathway to go on to become farm managers, assistant farm managers or business owners.  That is the way we can develop dairy farming to its maximum potential.  There is the potential for 6,000 jobs to be created in our business in the next five or six years.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Stapleton"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":366,"content":"<p>On the skills shortage in farming, has there been a geographic mapping of where the skills shortages are and in what type of areas?

The pilot project was a major effort in an area where we thought there were opportunities to draw people in and the numbers that went through with it were not at the anticipated level.  Farmers are making huge efforts in villages and towns to try to get people to work on farms.  Working on a farm is a cultural issue.  It is not for everybody.  It is probably not practical, realistic or ideal in a lot of situations for a person who grows up and lives in a town all of his or her life to go out and work on a farm.  While a lot of the work might be seen as manual, one needs a fair degree of experience and skills.<\/p><p>It involves looking after animals.  People would say one can teach a person to milk cows but it is not that simple.  It is quite a technical operation.  If one makes a mistake milking cows, I will not go into the nitty gritty of it but it is a very specialised job.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian McDonald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Mr. McDonald's argument regarding work permits would be much stronger if he were to formally engage on a larger scale and show that people with the necessary skills are not available here and neither is their potential to employ such people here.

There is a precedent both here and in the UK, where it has worked very well, for a seasonal workers scheme.  The frustration expressed by our members relates to the fact that we have had a very rapid expansion on the dairy side and farmers are trying very hard to get people to work on farms.  They cannot get people.  It is probably a bit unfair to say that the work permits solution is the first option because farmers have tried very hard to get people, but some response is required.  We would suggest having a more supervised type programme for people to come in and work on Irish farms would certainly be worth piloting.  We believe there are many people from countries outside the European Union who have a latent skill in agriculture who would have a great deal to contribute if they came to Ireland to work and they would also have the potential to get involved at managerial level on farms.  There is a great deal of frustration among farmers.  Someone else made the point that farmers are essentially sole traders.  They do not operate like a big company that has an advertising department and human resources department to seek to take on somebody.  This is a complex enough operation for a sole trader.  I believe we need to intervene if we are going to make it work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017121200002#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian McDonald"},{"type":"speech","time":1513094400,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I must concur with that comment.  Culturally, we have been moving towards an increasingly more urbanised environment during the past 20 to 30 years and it has been much harder to attract people into farming.  The sons of farmers who I would have gone to school with back in the day would have grabbed the opportunity to take over the family farm but they were given an education, choices and options to do different things.

We would be delighted if we had Irish workers who were interested and wanted to pursue a career in agriculture and it is because we cannot get them that we are looking for foreign workers.
