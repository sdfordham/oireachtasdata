I want to apologise for the delayed start to the meeting.  There was a Vote in the Seanad and we waited for our colleagues from the Seanad to arrive back.  That is the reason we suspended.<br \/>The purpose of the meeting is to have a discussion with a number of people who made written submissions on the review of the effectiveness of legislation relating to the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On behalf of the committee I am very pleased to welcome Baroness Nuala O'Loan.  She was the first Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, a post she held from 1999 to 2007.  She is very welcome.  I thank her for being here today and giving us her time and expertise.  <br \/>I welcome<b><\/b>Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, Acting Garda Commissioner, and her team.  I also welcome Mr. Ronan Brady, lecturer in journalism, Griffith College, Dublin and thank him for being here.  <br \/>The format of the meeting is that witnesses will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by a question and answer session.  I ask witnesses to keep their opening statements as brief and to the point as possible.  It would be very much appreciated if they could keep them to around five minutes or thereabouts.  <br \/>I wish to advise all members, witnesses and observers in the Visitors Gallery to please turn off all mobile telephones or switch them to aeroplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device.<\/p> <p>It is not sufficient to put them on silent mode as this will maintain the level of interference from the committee and impacts negatively on broadcast.  If, in the course of proceedings, there is interference I will ask everybody to switch off their mobile telephones completely or withdraw from the room because it is very annoying for people in television and broadcast to have to endure such interference.<\/p><p> Before beginning I draw the attention of all witnesses to the position in regard to privilege.  I ask witnesses to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> I invite Ms Nuala O'Loan to make her opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800003#C00200","speaker":"978","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401285900,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and express my appreciation for the invitation to appear before the committee.<\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has been in existence for some nine years now and has done some very good work.  However, following recent events, there is an opportunity to enhance and refine the law to make it a more effective and more independent organisation.  It is for the Irish State to determine how it legislates for police accountability and my observations, which are the product of my personal experience as Police Ombudsman and my work with policing and police accountability organisations across the world, are offered simply to assist in the reform processes.<\/p><p>  International experience would suggest that real independence and impartiality are key factors for the success of an independent investigative organisation.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act does not mention either independence or impartiality in the objectives which it sets for GSOC.  It would seem to me that the term \"fairness\" is a weaker, less specific term.  For example, it would be possible to deliver an equally bad service to everyone.  That would be fair but it would not be acceptable or effective.  I urge the inclusion of a duty on GSOC to act with impartiality and independently.  I also suggest that GSOC should be resourced to investigate every complaint rather than referring matters back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  This is necessary to demonstrate de facto the real independence of GSOC.  It should have the power to investigate policy and practice matters of its own volition.  These are the issues that enabled me as Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland to deliver a service.<\/p><p>  GSOC cannot currently investigate complaints or allegations against the Commissioner.  The committee has heard evidence of this.  I do not know of any other similar organisation where this is the case and it is not sustainable if GSOC is to be perceived as effective.  There will always be a suspicion that accountability is okay for junior officers but the chief has to be protected.  GSOC needs a complete entitlement to material to be able to do its job.  Currently the Commissioner can withhold material and advise the Minister to withhold material.  That could lead to a perception of cover-up.<\/p><p>  The appearance of independence is important.  GSOC was required to take as staff former civil servants and its current staff are civil servants - part of the apparatus of the administration of the State.  There has to be a complete separation between GSOC and the State. The current arrangements whereby serving garda&iacute; are based in the GSOC office is not conducive to any perception of independence, and perception is profoundly important.  I cannot conceive of anything which serving garda&iacute; could bring to the office now in terms of explanation of Garda practices which GSOC could not acquire through retired or former garda&iacute;.  GSOC needs an uninterrupted, immediate right of access to search police premises.  I dealt with that issue at some length in my initial submission.  This does not exist and is necessary.  The Garda Commissioner should be under a stated obligation to secure, preserve and provide evidence in every case.<\/p><p>  Current law enables officers subject to complaint to veto attempts at an informal resolution process.  There is a very low level of informal resolution here.  It is in the interests of everyone that simple, less complex complaints be dealt with more effectively.<\/p><p>  The provision which causes me considerable concern is the provision which enables prosecution of a person who makes a false or misleading complaint.  I consider that provision to be disproportionate, since it could well deter genuine complainants.  From my experience, it is not easy for most people to make a complaint against the police.  Many states contemplated introducing a provision like this at the request of the police and police representative organisations but decided against it.  Were I making change, I would repeal the section.  Although a person can defend themselves, the mere fact of the possibility of prosecution and the risk of a heavy fine and a prison sentence is a disproportionate disincentive to making a complaint which may be perfectly well justified.<\/p><p>  The legislation does not provide a right to GSOC to make recommendation for change in policy or practice following a conduct or criminal investigation.  I am aware that some such recommendations are made.   Such a provision would enable a better outcome for the people of Ireland from the investment currently made in police accountability.<\/p><p>  I would like to say more but think it is better that I give the committee the opportunity to ask me questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Baroness Nuala O'Loan"},{"type":"speech","time":1401285900,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800004#D00300","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401285900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 with the committee.  I have provided a document outlining our submission on a section by section basis, as requested.  I have also given the committee a printed version of the opening address.  To make the best use of time I propose to touch on a few of the key issues outlined.<\/p><p>  The revision of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 presents a unique opportunity for us to make sure we have the modern well-governed customer-facing police service we need.  As interim Garda Commissioner I have already launched a substantial reform and renewal programme to make sure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to have the trust, respect and confidence of the diverse communities it serves with pride.  We are at a defining moment in the history of the policing service, a moment at which the principles of accountability, transparency and professionalism must be at the core of a strong, confident and connected policing service and at which such principles must be seen to be at the core of everything we do in order that we are trusted and valued by the public we serve.  The revision of the Act is necessary because in the ten years since it was first drafted, Irish society and public expectations of its police service have changed.  The new Act must reflect this new landscape in which we now operate.  The 2005 Act brought about some very welcome changes but it is time to move forward to a new era of enhanced accountability.<\/p><p>  At the outset it is important to acknowledge the enormous contribution made on a daily basis by every member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Day in and day out, the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na serve this State and our local communities and work to keep them safe and secure.  They interact with families and individuals at some of the most challenging and vulnerable moments that are encountered in life.  Much of this work does not, and often should not, make headlines but it does touch hearts and minds and it does make a difference.<\/p><p>  Throughout its history An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has met and overcome new challenges, whether they came from the paramilitary threat that hung over this island for decades, from organised criminality or from emerging technologies.  We have done so in a spirit of doing what is right for the community and the country as well as what is in the interests of delivering professional and accountable policing.<\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 was a significant legislative initiative which brought clarity to the management and oversight of policing in this country.  It addressed the changing policing environment and enhanced our ability to meet the emerging challenges of delivering an effective, professional and accountable police service.  Since the publication of the Act, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been and continues to be subject to significant oversight from a range of different institutions: the Oireachtas, including this committee and other Oireachtas committees, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate, and judicial oversight of activities relating to State security.<\/p><p>  Our relationship with our external oversight authorities must be professional, transparent, open and demonstrate full engagement.  Such oversight is not just welcome but vital in a modern democracy.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recognises that accountability and transparency must be among the fundamental principles upon which we develop our policing service.  That complex task will be greatly helped by an independent policing authority.  This authority, together with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Inspectorate, will enhance public confidence in our policing function and frankly, right now, that reinforcement is necessary.<\/p><p>  I turn to some specific proposals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which draw both on our professional judgement and expertise and our practical knowledge and experience of providing a community-focused police service.  As I see it they fall into three broad categories: first, accountability and transparency in the delivery of policing; second, investigation of complaints about policing; and third, effective use of resources and ensuring best police practice.<\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na welcomes the proposed establishment of an independent police authority as a means of enhancing the delivery of a modern dynamic policing service and ensuring it meets the needs and expectations of the community.  We know that there are examples on these islands and further afield of how such authorities can operate.  The structure and make-up of that independent authority is a matter for Government and the Legislature.  The key element for us is to ensure the authority and its members are consistently guided and motivated by what is good for the community and good for policing.<\/p><p>  Our renewal programme is focused on ensuring we are in a state of readiness to provide the level of governance and accountability to serve the requirements of that authority, when established.  It is vital that we are accountable to national independent bodies.<\/p> <p>It is equally important that we are accountable to local communities.  The Irish model of policing admired by many police services around the world has been built on listening to, engaging and working in partnership with local communities to identify and solve problems.  To date, the joint policing committees have had a major role to play.  These partnerships between local stakeholders and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have successfully identified solutions for issues that impact on local communities.  These structures should continue to have a meaningful role and to be focused as locally as possible.<\/p><p> In respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, a strong and fully functioning commission which commands the confidence of the community plays a vital part in maintaining trust in policing.  We are committed to ensuring constructive engagement with GSOC to achieve our mutual objectives.  Our written submission proposes a number of changes to the workings and powers of GSOC.  These key proposals include that garda&iacute; should not investigate garda&iacute;.  As Baroness O'Loan stated, all complaints of a serious nature should be investigated by GSOC personnel, not by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This provides independent objectivity.  We support GSOC's submission that the definition covering what incidents fall into the serious crime category should be extended.  We also support the initiative to allow GSOC to resolve complaints by way of informal resolution with the consent of the complainant and the member complained of.<\/p><p> In respect of the Garda Inspectorate, since its inception the Garda Inspectorate has produced a number of insightful and valuable reports that have helped improve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, it is worth bearing in mind that some recommendations require resource investments which are difficult in the current climate in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &ndash; like other public bodies - has had to operate.<\/p><p> I also want to mention something in respect of receiving and responding to feedback.  I have stated from the outset that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be open to internal and external criticism if we are to strengthen and grow.  Dissent is not disloyalty, and different and differing views must be heard and supported as they can help to improve the service we provide.  Sometimes those criticisms may not be fully correct or justified but we need to learn to listen and to understand, and where there are issues that need to be addressed we must take appropriate action immediately.<\/p><p> In that context, the proposals for internal change include a restructuring of our internal affairs and professional standards department.  This would see the aligning of internal affairs, which directs investigations into allegations of Garda misconduct and examines internal disciplinary matters, and liaises with GSOC, and also the Garda professional standards unit, where standards and procedures can be reviewed so as to highlight areas of strategic concern and proactively address systemic challenges.<\/p><p> We would also submit that the remit of the internal audit unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be strengthened to enable it to audit and report on strategic, operational, financial and reputational risks to the organisation.  The unit should also be empowered to provide an objective opinion to the chair of the independent audit committee concerning systems, procedures and controls which will then bring the matter to the attention of the Commissioner.  We also submit that there is a need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to conduct public attitude surveys as is already provided for in the Act and we would submit that there should be an alternative public consultation forum that could be held to enhance that process.<\/p><p> Finally, I recommend that the official title of \"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\" be adopted in the interest of consistency.  In the previous Act it was \"The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\", and we believe in the interest of consistency it would be \"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\".<\/p><p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its members hold a privileged position in society.  We serve with energy, dedication and pride and must be held accountable, at national and local level.  We are at a point in our history where we can build an organisation so that the Irish police service is a case study in responsive excellence, a leader of national and international best practice, and a constantly evolving force for good in our nation.<\/p><p> It is my job to get on with reshaping An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that it is worthy of the people it serves and worthy, too, of the great people who work within it.  An independent policing authority that will hold us to account for the delivery of a modern dynamic and human rights based policing service is welcome.  This authority, together with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Inspectorate, will enhance and ensure public confidence in our policing functions.  A revised Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act has a major role to play in helping us reach that goal of being a world-class police service that meets the needs of all communities and citizens for the benefit of the State.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for their time and will answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401286500,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Commissioner.

The Freedom of Information Acts should be extended to the Garda.  The 1997 Freedom of Information Act was carefully drafted so as to allow this.  Section 23 of the Act already contains the necessary protection for confidential matters in the struggle against crime.  Since 1997, all that has been required for the extension of freedom of information to the Garda has been a decision of the Government.  No further legislation has been required.<br \/>Ireland is nearly unique, in so far as my studies go, in not extending freedom of information to the Garda.  In other countries, progressive policing organisations and police officers have sought to bring their organisations under a freedom of information regime, arguing that it is vital in maintaining public confidence in the policing service.  In Ireland, however, the authorities have fostered Garda antagonism towards openness, manifested in the legislation preventing proper contact between the media and serving officers.  It would be absurd to claim with certainty that the extension of freedom of information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have prevented the scandals that have recently been unearthed by Garda whistleblowers but it would be equally absurd to deny that a freedom of information regime would have made these scandals less likely.<br \/>Members of the committee can see my credentials, such as they are.  They are printed for them in the presentation.  I will move on to the key points I want to make.<br \/>First, the 1997 Act was an enormous step towards openness in a country where bureaucracy and censorship were more normal.  In 2003, there was a kind of bureaucratic coup in the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003 which was intended to reduce the effectivity of the 1997 Act.  Both parties in the current Government have undertaken to reform that.  They are preparing legislation and have already implemented certain aspects of legislation in this regard.  However, one aspect does not require additional legislation, that is, this one.  It is not a radical measure.<br \/>There is what some journalists have pointed to as &quot;a convenient confusion&quot; that in some way freedom of information would inhibit intelligence gathering or crime investigation.  That is not the case.  The Freedom of Information Act protects the necessary confidentiality of policing work.  The more forward-looking police leaders in our nearest neighbour have been positive about freedom of information legislation.  Sir Hugh Orde, of whom the committee will be aware and who went on to head the Association of Chief Police Officers, ACPO, in the United Kingdom, states that he pushed hard to place that association under the Westminster Freedom of Information Act 2000, and this was accomplished wholly voluntarily in 2011.<br \/>The ACPO website provides easy access to disclosure logs.  These are the letters that they send out.  They are the documents that they circulate among themselves.  They are redacted - material that could compromise confidentiality is blacked out - but, in the course of my studies, I have read letters to chief police officers from ACPO about intelligence training and other highly sensitive matters.  The redaction means that no terrorist could possibly divine any information that was useful to him or her, but by openly displaying the existence of these letters, ACPO is enabling serious journalists to ask more serious questions.  Of course, ACPO is within its powers to withhold certain information if it is not in the public interest to release it.  The logs contain information on such matters as terrorism and allied matters, criminal justice and performance management.  I have read the Metropolitan Police's disclosure logs as well.  These include, for example, the number of 999 calls which the police have missed.<br \/>In 2004, assistant chief constable Ian Readhead of the Hampshire police testified before a committee, not unlike this one, in Westminster.  He was asked has freedom of information inhibited police work, and his answer was emphatic.  He stated:<blockquote>No, I do not think so for one moment.  There is a clear balance to be drawn here between the right of the public to know and the right of the Service to sustain public safety in general, and the legislation gives ample opportunity for us to be able to secure information and keep information confidential which would threaten public safety if it were exposed.  I do not think that is the issue at all.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>The assistant chief constable mentioned the culture of the service, whereby there is a tendency towards secrecy, and said he did not think that was sustainable.  He concluded by stating: &quot;There are many things that you could say about the way in which the Special Branch carries out its business which would not prejudice public safety at all.&quot;<br \/>Members will be aware that I also am a representative of the National Union of Journalists and Irish journalists find little evidence of such views among An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda press office was described by one of my colleagues as a bulwark against openness, which frankly is what most journalists feel about it.  Section 62 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 contains a presumption of criminality against disclosing information to journalists, <i>inter alia<\/i>, without the approval of senior officers.  This is enormously disproportionate.  The international free speech NGO, Index on Censorship, has stated, quite rightly, that this legislation is &ldquo;not the behaviour of a European democracy&rdquo;.  It is, however, quite consistent with the hugger-mugger attitude concerning the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The absence of outside scrutiny contributes to behaviour such as the refusal to co-operate with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  It also contributes to a commonplace secrecy tactic whereby one defines a hot topic as an operational matter, even when disclosure would in no way inhibit any operation.<br \/>None of what I have said should be construed as anti-garda.  Speaking personally, I have good reason to thank garda&iacute; for their kindness and their protection on many occasions.  I have also worked with the United Nations internationally and in Asia and Africa I have encountered UN officials who class An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as one of the best police services in the world, based on the work done by garda&iacute; on UN assignments  Regretfully, however, I must agree with my colleague, Ken Foxe, who has stated a genuine argument can be made that had freedom of information, FOI, been in place within the Garda over the past 20 years, it may have made it a more open institution and helped its members to understand that legitimate inquiry is not dangerous.  He went on to state that a more open, more questioning culture across the Garda may have helped to avoid some of the enormous reputational damage it has suffered in recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401287100,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brady and greatly appreciate his contribution.

I will extend that a little by inquiring on her views as to how far that should go.  In the context of GSOC's remit, is one merely talking about Garda stations and Garda headquarters or should other facilities be included?

On the issue of access to personal premises, that is, to the homes of serving guards, to their cars, caravans or whatever it is, I am not fully experienced in criminal law here but that would be dealt with in the process of criminal investigation and I would expect the normal warrant process to apply to that.  Consequently, that would be possible, were one conducting a criminal investigation.  Very often before that, however, there is a question about whether material may or may not be held in a police station or a Garda station.  My experience has been that very often, there is material that may well be useful to an investigation, which is kept in lockers or desks or even, in the North anyway, in the roof spaces of stations.  The problem as I perceive it at present is that the legislation provides for notice to be given.  In most situations, GSOC would be able to give notice that it wished to come in and look for something or to ask for something but in order to have independence, there must be a right to go and to enter.  We had that right in the North and it was a necessary part of some of our investigations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Baroness Nuala O'Loan"},{"type":"speech","time":1401287100,"counter":21,"content":"<p>As a follow-up to that question, I was thinking, for instance, of when a serving member of the force happens to have certain items on their own premises.

From allegations of misconduct, there always arise questions on management, training, supervision and that sort of thing.  In the North, we had a power to conduct policy and practice investigations of our own initiative without the consent of the Minister.  We would gather together the information and where we became aware of a trend of problems, perhaps about management, about securing evidence or about dealing with minorities, we would then conduct a policy and practice investigation and publish the results of that investigation on the website.  That is an enormously important contribution to the efficiency of policing.  It derives from the investigation of complaints and for GSOC to then hand that to the inspectorate to conduct these focused investigations would require the inspectorate to go back to the beginning.

The role of the internal affairs section is to pursue any disciplinary issues that may arise in respect of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The disciplinary regulations set out an internal framework whereby members are investigated for disciplinary offences which may not amount to misconduct.  All cases of misconduct are referred to GSOC but the internal framework can deal with disciplinary offences that do not amount to misconduct or malpractice.  We envisage that the role of the professional standards unit in internal affairs would be come more robust to allow us to proactively identify any issues arising and, as happens in other jurisdictions, to allow us an opportunity consider integrity testing among members and identify issues before they become problems.

Officers were very resistant to it on occasion but the reality was that it was actually a huge learning exercise, like on-the-job training, both for officers and for members of the public.  In the case of members of the public, it was about what they could legitimately expect of policing and for officers it was about the impact on people of the way in which they conducted themselves which may have been off-hand or brusque and which may have resulted from them working a very heavy shift, for example.  Nevertheless, this was interpreted by the member of the public as being rude and not the kind of service to which the public is entitled.  An informal resolution process can actually inform both parties and improve the service delivery by the officer.

It would be a very positive move if we could come to a form of either agreement or triage.

There can be a big economic threat to national security.

In that situation, I believe it would be entirely appropriate for GSOC to be the recipient and to have a unit dedicated to such whistleblowing activity.  If this were done, the whistleblower would be assured that the person to whom he or she was reporting was independent.  However, one would have to buttress that by the introduction of a duty on managers within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal positively with whistleblowers and make it a disciplinary offence not to positively respond to or manage whistleblowing.  There is an article in the PSNI code of ethics, which is its disciplinary code, which makes it an offence not to do this.  If one does a number of things together then this makes whistleblowing possible.<\/p> <p>Whistleblowing is about improving policing.  Nobody becomes a police officer to do wrong.  Corruption, carelessness and laziness creep in.  I would place it within GSOC with a statutory power.  I do not believe it would be adequate to have a non-statutory recipient of some type outside that, so I would put it within GSOC and then give it the proper powers and the limited remit.  One would not want them dealing with human resource disputes between members and things like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800009#J01400","nonspeaker":"Baroness Nuala O'Loan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401289500,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Does the acting Garda Commissioner wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800010#K00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401289500,"counter":63,"content":"<p>There is an opportunity under the Protected Disclosures Bill to put it on the type of statutory footing that Baroness O'Loan mentions.

One must also have a function which deals with turning a blind eye - the blue wall where nothing happens when somebody does something.<\/p><p>  With regard to oversight, my understanding would be that GSOC is responsible to the courts by way of judicial review.  It must be responsible to the D&aacute;il.  There would be a requirement that one does not second-guess the process of criminal investigation and such matters, but I believe parliamentary accountability is the best process for calling to account an organisation such as GSOC.  At present, as I understand it, GSOC reports to the Minister for Justice and Equality, and that is where the accountability lies.  To my mind that is too close a relationship and there is not sufficient independence for the Minister or for GSOC in that arrangement.  There is also not sufficient power for Parliament.  I suggest that there should be a reporting to this committee, perhaps, or to whatever committee is considered appropriate, as well as the responsibility to the courts and to a freedom of information commissioner.  There will be a raft of other levels of accountability also where GSOC is making decisions that might be challenged through other legal processes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800010#K00500","nonspeaker":"Baroness Nuala O'Loan"},{"type":"speech","time":1401289500,"counter":66,"content":"<p>My other question relates to Mr. Brady's concerns regarding freedom of information and making An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na subject to the 1997 Act.

Those are the main points in those paragraphs.  Would she not say that on the ground the opposite has been the case in recent months and that people have lost their confidence and trust in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Many people, both within the Garda and in the wider community, are deeply disturbed about some of the evidence that has come forward from people such as the whistleblowers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800010#K00900","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401289500,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Over the last number of months public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has certainly been impacted by many of the issues that have been raised.  I do not think it is just confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also confidence in the entire administration.  It is very important that we work hard and tirelessly in the context of restoring that public confidence and demonstrating that, as an administration, we are collectively fully committed to addressing these issues and putting them right.  In the context of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na specifically, we have the programme.  A programme in itself means nothing; the issue is the actions under that programme.  The first thing I did on becoming interim Garda Commissioner was to engage very widely with our internal and external stakeholders.  By that I mean that I met, along with my senior management team, individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in stations.  I considered it very important that in times of turbulence they knew there was strong visible leadership from the top and that the norms, values and standards we expect were being driven from the top.<\/p><p>  There are almost 16,000 people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including uniformed and sworn members, civilians and the Garda Reserve.  I can give a good example.  Last weekend, at the One Direction concerts which were attended by 250,000 people over three nights, I went to meet and brief our members who were dealing with that.  As I said to them, there are so many things we can do.  People ask me every day if I will go out and refute what is being said.  I do not think it is right to refute what is being said.  The right thing to do is to allow a process to take place where all of the allegations that have been made are fully investigated.  We very much welcome that and will co-operate with the commissions of investigation.  As I told the members both in the rural stations around the country and in Croke Park last week, the public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be restored by them and by the people in our support offices one encounter at a time.  Every time a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engages with somebody it is an opportunity to demonstrate the professionalism, dedication, energy and commitment that I spoke about in my opening address.  I firmly believe that is how we will restore public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  From a leadership point of view, it is very important that we provide strong, visible leadership, that we hold people to account and, equally, that we hold ourselves to account for living up to the values and behaviour we expect of our members.  Collectively, we can work together to restore public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The work that is being done in reforming the 2005 Act will help that and support the programme we have already initiated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800010#K01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Noir&iacute;n O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1401289500,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Basically, Ms O'Sullivan is saying she accepts that trust and confidence are two issues for policing in this country.

If any indication or insinuation of wrongdoing were identified, it would be immediately transferred or referred to GSOC for investigation.  That is how we envisage that process working.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Purcell and his colleagues.<\/p><p>  The format of the meeting will see Mr. Purcell invited to make an opening statement, which will be followed by a questions and answers session.

My aim is to be as helpful as I can in their deliberations.  If they will permit, I will add a few key points.<\/p><p>  As the committee is aware, recent events have led to the establishment of the Fennelly commission of investigation, which will have an opportunity to hear from all sides regarding what was an unprecedented, complex and difficult matter.  A further commission is to be established following the publication of the Guerin report.  In addition to these inquiries, the Government has outlined a comprehensive system-wide reform plan that represents a sea change in the way policing will be delivered.  This process is being led by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who has announced a number of measures.<\/p><p>  Legislation is being prepared to establish an independent Garda authority by the end of this year.  This is a major reform initiative that will transform the relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government.  In future, Garda Commissioners will be appointed following an open competition.  This process will be undertaken by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and means that the post of Commissioner will be filled with regard to best recruitment practices.<\/p><p>  Legislation is being drafted to strengthen the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  As the Minister has stated, the measures in prospect will bring the Garda Commissioner within the scope of the complaints that can be dealt with by GSOC and increase the capacity and remit of GSOC to initiate reviews of Garda practice and procedure without reference to the Minister.<\/p><p>  The Garda Inspectorate is to carry out a follow-up review of the Guerin report, covering serious crime investigation, management and operational and procedural issues, taking into account the implementation of recommendations already made by the inspectorate in earlier reports and also work currently under way by the inspectorate.<\/p><p>  Crucially, the Protected Disclosures Bill, as introduced by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will include provisions to enable a Garda whistleblower to report concerns to GSOC for independent investigation.  This will mean that Garda whistleblowers will, from now on, have a strong legal framework within which to report concerns, strong legal protection against penalisation and the opportunity of a fully independent legal examination of their concerns.<\/p><p>  A review of the performance, management and administration of the Department of Justice of Equality will also be undertaken by independent experts before the summer recess.<\/p><p>  These measures are designed to transform oversight and accountability and, taken together, will constitute a fundamental change in the way the Garda is managed and relates to the Government and the Department.<\/p><p>  As I outlined in my statement, the Department has a broad remit.  On the Garda side, the Department's purpose can be said to be one of supporting the Garda on the one hand and seeking to achieve appropriate accountability to the Government on the other.  The context for all of this has evolved over decades when the very existence of the State was under threat.  It is now clear, and the Department recognises fully, that the arrangements for dealing with Garda whistleblowers did not prove fit for purpose.  In so far as that may have involved shortcomings on the part of the Department, I have no hesitation in apologising to all those who have been affected by those shortcomings, including the whistleblowers themselves.<\/p><p>  In considering the issues before the committee, we need to consider the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which is the framework provided by the Oireachtas within which the Department and Garda operate.  The Act distinguishes between the roles of the Minister and the Commissioner, the Minister being responsible for policy and direction and the Commissioner being responsible for independently running the force.  The framework includes independent oversight by GSOC and independent inspection by the Garda Inspectorate.  It also provides for the role of confidential recipient.<\/p><p>  The tools in the Act provide for the Commissioner to account to the Government and Minister through the Secretary General.  There is a duty on the Commissioner to keep the Minister and Secretary General fully informed on various important matters and the Minister is in turn accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>I say this not to seek to pass the parcel but rather to point to the complex web that exists to ensure the operational independence of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while at the same time ensuring accountability.  The extent to which this framework has worked or not worked, and why, will no doubt be teased out by the forthcoming commission of inquiry.  In fairness to the staff of the Department, I have to make clear my belief that we were at all times motivated by one thing alone, which was to act in the public interest within the law.  In that context, I believe that we acted in a reasonable manner within the structures in place at the time.  A lot has worked.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had notable success on the crime detection and security fronts.  Some things have not worked and we may have been slower than we might have been in responding to those.<\/p><p> The truth is that the structures put a lot of reliance on the relationship between the Garda Commissioner and the Minister and Department.  Given the sensitive issues being dealt with, mutual trust and confidence is and has always been crucial in this relationship and this has been built up over a long period of time, not during the term of any single officeholder.  The legislation provides for a duty to account and to provide information supplemented by the independent oversight mechanism of GSOC.  We do not have a separate investigative set-up in the Department.  It is always a challenge in dealing with complex agencies to avoid &ldquo;regulatory capture&rdquo; and this is where lessons can be learnt as we, collectively, consider what enhanced structures and processes should now be put in place. <\/p><p> This raises the legitimate question of whether over a long period we could have done better in learning lessons and improving Garda accountability.  Yes, we could have done.  I cannot say that we have always, at all times, achieved a perfect balance in managing critical policy and operational issues across the huge range of justice and equality responsibilities.  Most assuredly, I acknowledge that the Guerin report has given rise to a grave situation which I must devote my utmost effort and attention to resolving though specific and targeted changes.<\/p><p> Some of the relentless criticism of the Department and the excellent people whom I have the privilege to lead as Secretary General is not well founded.  I recognise, however, that confidence in the Department has been damaged and must be quickly restored.  There is in the Department a determination to change what needs to be changed and to turn recent events into an opportunity to learn key lessons and put them into action.<\/p><p> As Secretary General of the Department, I hope to engage with members of the Committee to explain matters as best I can.  I also look forward to the outcome of the committee&rsquo;s current consultative process in contributing to the ongoing work to identify the best way to address the weaknesses that have been exposed.  Having said that, and as I have explained in my written statement, I hope members will understand that I am somewhat constrained in what I can deal with.<\/p><p> I fully appreciate these matters are of legitimate interest to committee members.  The difficulty is that, although it would be much easier in many ways to come in here today and fully answer their questions, I must respect the fact that the Fennelly commission has to undertake the work it has been charged with by the Government and these Houses. <\/p><p> The Government has also decided that a commission of investigation will be established following publication of the Guerin report so some constraint must also be applied to those issues.  The commission in that instance has yet to be established and its terms of reference have not yet been fixed.  I will, therefore, try to assist the committee as best I can on the issues Mr. Guerin raised about the Department but I hope it will understand that it may not be possible as yet to deal in detail with matters which must be left to the commission of investigation.<\/p><p> The report raises fundamental issues about the statutory framework and various agencies of the justice system, including the Department of Justice and Equality.  Of course, the nature of Mr. Guerin's review meant that he did not find himself in a position to comprehensively address these broader issues.  Presumably because of the timescale involved and because his primary purpose was to consider whether a further inquiry was necessary, at which all parties would have an opportunity to present their cases, he did not seek any views from the Department or the Minister on why it responded as it did to the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe.  Neither, for reasons which he outlined, did Mr Guerin have the benefit of the GSOC perspective on these matters.  Inevitably, this means that the legal analysis contained in the report and the understanding of the policy issues involved are incomplete.  The commission of investigation will provide an opportunity for these to be teased out fully.<\/p><p> As he emphasises in his report, the purpose of the review was not to make any findings of fact or to determine any disputed question either of fact or law.  Mr. Guerin questions the lack of formal submissions, etc., to the Minister.  In hindsight, the lack of such material which, had it existed might have been of assistance to Mr. Guerin, is regrettable, although this reflects a practice that Ministers might often be briefed orally on particular matters and draft replies prepared in line with that briefing.  It is, however, absolutely the case that the Department and the Minister were aware of the ministerial functions, scope and limitations of the provisions in sections 42 and 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and of the functions and provisions of the confidential recipient regulations.  The Department had a very detailed and nuanced understanding of these legal provisions which I will go through in detail.<\/p><p> I accept that the record keeping meant that Mr. Guerin does not have the full picture of the thinking in the Department on the action it took and the advice it gave or, indeed, of the then Minister's thinking.  I emphasise that before all of this came to light and as part of a review of risks around communications, information and records, I commissioned an internal project which is well under way to address our record keeping and other related matters. <\/p><p> It has undoubtedly been the practice of the Department and successive Ministers to place considerable reliance on what they are told by the Garda Commissioner of the day.  There are obvious reasons for this.  The Government appoints a Garda Commissioner because it has confidence in her or him to run the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whose functions include detecting crime, preserving law and order and national security.  If the Department or the Minister were not in a position to place such reliance on what the Garda Commissioner said, this would have the most serious implications.  By law, the Garda Commissioner has the function of directing and controlling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He or she is also responsible for the maintenance of good order and discipline within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> There is a further crucial point which does not appear to be analysed in the report.  The Minister had been advised by the Garda Commissioner in his report that the investigations into Sergeant McCabe&rsquo;s substantive allegations had been based on earlier reports made to the confidential recipient.  The Minister and the Department, naturally, knew of the provision in the confidential recipient regulations providing that all allegations made through the confidential reporting mechanism have to be notified to GSOC, in accordance with arrangements agreed with GSOC, and would have been conscious of the rationale for this, namely, that GSOC would have knowledge of the allegations and the response and could initiate an investigation in the public interest under section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 if it thought it appropriate.  This was, as it was intended to be, a substantial reassurance for the Department and the Minister on the existence of independent oversight in relation to the investigation of the allegations.  This is aside from the fact that the Garda files on these matters were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed no prosecution.<\/p><p> Neither the Department nor the Minister is an investigatory body or has investigatory powers.  The Minister does have powers under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to require the carrying out of investigations, but it is important to understand the detail of those powers in order to analyse Mr Guerin&rsquo;s key findings in relation to the Minister and the Department and I will be happy to expand on this, in so far as I can, for the committee&rsquo;s information.<\/p><p> None of what is set out here is intended to minimise the difficulties which have arisen.  We had already recognised that the legal provisions for dealing with whistleblowers were proving inadequate and that there should be a mechanism for complaints to be made directly by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to GSOC.  It is intended simply to set out why the advice which was given and the decisions taken within the Department were considered reasonable given the structures in place at the time.<\/p><p> As I stated in my letter to the clerk of the committee, I will be happy to return at a future date to discuss these issues in detail with the committee when the various commissions in being and to be established have issued their findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800015#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Purcell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401293100,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Purcell for his presentation.  Several issues arise from it and from his correspondence with the committee.

The committee reserved its right to revisit these issues any time.

However, as I have indicated, I am precluded from discussing certain matters.  I have said already that I am quite happy, at the appropriate time after the commissions have reported, to discuss it in full with the committee.  I have sent a copy of the letter I received from the Fennelly commission for information.  I drew the attention of the committee to the fact that the commission states it will treat my reply and my statement in confidence, save to the extent that it may be required under the provisions of the Act, particularly section 12, to disclose them or to include them in its reports in accordance with section 32 of the Act.  Further, the commission's letter refers to section 11 of the Act stating that, subject to certain exceptions, it requires the commission to conduct its investigations in private.<\/p><p>  The committee's letter makes it clear that they intend for me to give my evidence in public.  Accordingly, any inquiry by the committee which impinges on paragraphs N and O of the commission's terms of reference - or, indeed, any of the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission - is highly likely to undermine and prejudice the work of the commission and will run counter to the commission's procedures to conduct its investigation in private.  It would also mean that I would be giving evidence in public and in advance of any other witnesses relevant to the Fennelly commission who would be giving their evidence in private and who would already have heard or read any evidence that I gave in public if I did so.<\/p><p>  I have already mentioned the Oireachtas standing order to which the committee referred, which states that a matter may not be raised in such a way that it appears to be an attempt to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal.  I acknowledge that although the standing order does not specifically refer to a commission of inquiry, because the standing orders predate the 2004 Act, the intention is clear.  Accordingly, I asked the committee to take this into consideration and to refrain from inquiring on any matters that impinge upon any of the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  Having regard to the above, the committee's own terms of reference cannot be used to undermine or prejudice the specific remit given to Mr. Justice Fennelly by way of resolution passed in the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into matters within its terms of reference.  The terms of reference of the joint committee on justice, with its remit of inquiring into the administration of the Department, cannot be used to undermine or prejudice the Fennelly commission's work, a task given to it by the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, on the matter of the Guerin report, the Government has decided and made public its decision to establish a commission of investigation under the Act to investigate the issues identified by Se&aacute;n Guerin in his report as warranting further inquiry.  As the establishment of the commission is imminent, I am deeply concerned that my giving of evidence in public to the committee at this point would in the same way potentially undermine and prejudice the work of the intended commission.<\/p><p>  I stated in my remarks that I regard the Guerin report and the proposed commission of investigation in a slightly different light, although I remain very concerned about my giving of evidence in public to this committee or, indeed, anywhere else where I might be asked to give it, as it has the potential to prejudice and impinge on that commission of investigation, the establishment of which is imminent.  However, I am prepared to answer questions relating to the Guerin report to the best of my ability, but I ask the Chairman to give me some leeway, in the context of how I may answer the questions about the Guerin report, to take account of the issues I have raised.  My position is clear with regard to any issues that are covered by the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  I have circulated the letter I received from Mr. Justice Fennelly in respect of that matter.  Members of the committee will have had an opportunity to read it and to consider it.  <\/p><p>  I have never before found myself, and I hope never again to find myself, in a position where in any way I might be seen to be anything other than the absolute maximum of assistance to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but I think this is a rather unusual position to be placed in where a commission of investigation chaired by a Supreme Court judge has been established whose work is already under way.  It seems to me to be a rather unique situation in that what could be seen as a parallel inquiry is proceeding while I am being asked to give evidence relating to matters covered by the terms of reference of the Fennelly commission.  I am unfortunately in a position where I have to say I simply will not be able to answer questions relating to that matter.  I hope that the committee will understand the difficult situation in which I find myself.  I appreciate the point made by the Chairman and I reiterate my commitment that at such a time as the Fennelly commission completes its deliberations and produces its report - regardless of the outcome of that report and whatever findings it may make - I will be quite happy to come in to this or any other committee to discuss any matters of relevance that the committee seeks to inquire into.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800017#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Purcell"},{"type":"speech","time":1401293700,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Purcell.

During his presentation Mr. Purcell stated, \"Neither the Department nor the Minister are investigatory bodies or have investigatory powers.\"  My question in that regard relates to issues raised in the Guerin report.  Why was an investigation not undertaken by the Department into the allegations put forward by Sergeant McCabe and, in particular, why was such an investigation not conducted in 2012 when the confidential recipient wrote to the Minister regarding allegations made against the Garda Commissioner?  Such an investigation would be required under the terms of the 2007 regulations, section 8 of which states: \"On receipt of such a report, the Minister, unless he or she has reason to believe that the allegation contained in it was not made in good faith or is false, frivolous or vexatious, shall cause the allegation to be investigated or take such other action as he or she considers appropriate in the circumstances.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800018#S03100","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401294300,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Am I correct in believing that the Senator has posed her questions in the context of the Guerin report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800018#S03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Purcell"},{"type":"speech","time":1401294300,"counter":247,"content":"<p>Yes, as I stated before I posed them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800018#S03300","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1401294300,"counter":248,"content":"<p>As I mentioned at the outset, I am concerned about the issues involved in terms of any commission of investigation that is imminent.  However, I will try to answer any questions.  As a result of the fact that I must be very careful about what I say and, effectively, because this may be something that will impinge on the workings of a commission of inquiry that is going to be established in respect of the Guerin report, I am going to be cautious but I will provide some detail on this.  The committee will have to bear with me in that regard, even if it takes some time to go into the detail.<br \/>In the report, Mr. Guerin mentions in his analysis that it is apparent that the Minister was invited to exercise two specific functions.  One was to cause an inquiry to be held under section 42 of the 2005 Act and to cause the allegation to be investigated or take such other action as the Minister considered appropriate in the circumstances.  He commented that:<blockquote>What is important about these specific Ministerial functions is that they enable the Minister to ensure that an investigation, in the true sense, independent of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, can be conducted into matters that might be the subject of a complaint made to the Minister.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>He goes on to state: <blockquote><br \/>From the papers I have seen, I have had difficulty finding material which demonstrated that the Department identified and understood the significant independent statutory role which the Minister had to perform in respect of these matters.  The practice adopted when matters were brought to the Department's attention was invariably to refer the issues that had been raised to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While it would, of course, be entirely reasonable to expect that, where a complaint is made, opportunity will be given to the person the subject of the complaint to respond to it, it is a different matter altogether to be entirely satisfied by that response.<\/blockquote>In effect, Mr. Guerin summarises the process of determining Sergeant McCabe's complaint went no further than the Minister receiving and acting upon the advice of the person who was the subject of the complaint.  His conclusion was, for whatever reason, that the approach adopted had the result that there was no independent investigation of Sergeant McCabe's complaints and that there is a cause for concern as to the adequacy of the investigation of the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe to the Minister for Justice and Equality, and a sufficient basis for concern as to whether all appropriate steps were taken by the Minister for Justice and Equality to investigate and address the specified complaints.<br \/>While Mr. Guerin emphasises at the start of his report that he has not made any findings or determinations, clearly these are critical conclusions.  In analysing them it is helpful to recall key facts and legal provisions.  The allegation against the Garda Commissioner centred on the contention that the Garda Commissioner had been guilty of misconduct for listing a superintendent for promotion who in essence had allegedly been in neglect of his duties by permitting seriously inadequate policing practices in his Garda district.  It might be mentioned here for completeness that promotions to the rank of chief superintendent are made by Government on the basis of the outcome of competitive interviews by a board which under the relevant regulations is composed of two independent persons from outside the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one of whom is the chair of the board and a deputy Garda Commissioner.<br \/>It is important to note that no direct allegations of misconduct were made against the Garda Commissioner.  They were made against the superintendent in question and, to some extent, against other members.  With the greatest respect, it is submitted that in all the circumstances, the characterisation of the action of the Minister and the Department as merely receiving and acting upon the advice of the person who is the subject of the complaint is open to question.<br \/>The Garda Commissioner is the person who has the statutory function of directing and controlling An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of carrying on, managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  More particularly, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for discipline in the force.  While Mr. Guerin's report now raises serious issues about the nature of the Garda Commissioner's response to the Department, it is submitted that the formal written advice and assurances of the Garda Commissioner to the Minister on the adequacy of investigation into Sergeant McCabe's substantive allegations cannot fairly be characterised as merely taking the word of the person against whom allegations have been made.<br \/>It was also clear from the Garda Commissioner's response that a substantial file had been submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who had directed that there be no prosecutions.  While Mr. Guerin mentions this, he did not discuss its significance.  It meant that the Minister could be assured that the investigation files had been examined independently by the Director of Public Prosecutions who had not directed any prosecutions.<br \/>As I mentioned earlier, there is a further crucial point which Mr. Guerin does not appear to analyse in his findings.  The Minister had been advised by the Garda Commissioner in his report that the investigations into Sergeant McCabe's substantive allegations had been based on earlier reports made to the confidential recipient.  The Minister and the Department naturally knew of the provision in the confidential recipient regulations providing that all allegations through the confidential reporting mechanism have to be forwarded to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, as explained earlier, and would have been conscious of the rationale for this, namely, that GSOC would have sight of the allegations, and the response, and could initiate an investigation in the public interest under section 102 of the 2005 Act if it thought it appropriate.  This was, as it was intended to be, a substantial reassurance for the Department and the Minister on the existence of independent oversight regarding the investigation of the allegations.<br \/>The Minister was faced with a formal written assurance by the Garda Commissioner of the position regarding the superintendent on which he placed reliance to an extent successive Ministers would be likely to have done, augmented by the fact that the DPP had been involved in the matter and in the context where GSOC had sight of the allegations and outcome, and could have instigated its own independent investigation.<br \/>With all that has become known since, it might well have been better if a different course of action had been taken but the Department would say that the advice it gave the Minister was reasonable based on what was known at the time and on the statutory provisions in place, which we have since widely acknowledged to be less than satisfactory.  That is one of the reasons the amendments to the Protected Disclosures Bill are being taken and why careful examination of the powers that relate to the remit of GSOC is under way.<br \/>If the Minister, despite all these factors, had been minded to cause any further investigation of the allegations, the obvious option would have been for him to refer them to GSOC under section 102 of the 2005 Act rather than cause an inquiry under section 42 of that Act.  Mr. Guerin did not consider this point but, in any event, the Minister would have been faced with two issues in that regard.  First, he would have had to satisfy the tests for referral to GSOC under section 102, namely, that it would have had to appear to him to indicate that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence or may have behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.  This would be happening in circumstances where the Garda Commissioner effectively assured him that the opposite was the case.  Second, the Minister would have been aware that GSOC already had sight of the allegations and the outcomes and could have initiated, but chose not to, its own investigation under section 102 on the very grounds that the Minister would have used to refer the allegations to it.<br \/>As regards the request from Sergeant McCabe's solicitor for an inquiry under section 42 of the 2005 Act, the crucial difficulty that arose in that regard was the fact that consent was not forthcoming despite repeated reminders to Sergeant McCabe's solicitor to transmit the material to the Garda Commissioner.  While Mr. Guerin acknowledges this, no explanation was forthcoming in the report as to why the consent was not forthcoming, other than references to Sergeant McCabe losing all faith in his superior officers.  No decision could properly be made to establish such an inquiry without the complaints being first put to the Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800018#S03400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Purcell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401294900,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Can I get clarification?

We wrote on perhaps five occasions to the solicitor requesting his permission to refer these dossiers to the Garda Commissioner because in order to make an informed choice regarding whether a section 42 or a section 102 inquiry would be taken, the Minister had to have something other than allegations.  This is not in any way a reflection on Sergeant McCabe but when someone makes allegations, allegations are not facts.  Establishing an inquiry either under section 102 or section 42 is a significant step to take so in that context, some response was required and the only person who would have been in a position to provide that response, other than Sergeant McCabe, would have been the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>  While the point was not reached where a decision was to be made on holding an inquiry under section 42, and acknowledging fully the reality that Mr. Guerin did not find any material containing a specific analysis of that, the Department fully appreciated the existence of section 42 as a potential option but understood also the limitations of section 42.  It had already been noted that in an inquiry under section 42, any information, document or thing provided by a person to that inquiry is not admissible in criminal proceedings.  That contrasts sharply with an investigation by GSOC following a referral by the Minister of a matter under section 102 of the Act or in cases where GSOC was determined to carry out such an investigation because that can be a full criminal investigation.<\/p><p>  There are other aspects of section 42 which, while not discussed in the report by Mr. Guerin, are important in understanding the potential for its use in inquiring into serious allegations of misconduct.  Section 42 enables the Minister, with respect to any matter considered by him or her to be of public concern, to by order appoint a person to inquire into any aspect of the administration, operation, practice or procedure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the conduct of its members and make a report to the Minister.  On the face of it, that is a broad-ranging power.<\/p> <p>Indeed, section 42 was amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2007 to extend its scope to the conduct of members and to provide for the compellability of witnesses, in that non-compliance by any person with a section 42 inquiry may be brought before the High Court and treated as contempt.  Crucially however, there is no power to administer the oath to any person appearing before a section 42 inquiry, unlike, for example, inquiries under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts or the Commissions of Investigation Act.  This also is in contrast to the statutory predecessor of section 42, which was section 12 of the Dublin Police Act 1924, which was used in the inquiry into the death of Brian Rossiter that reported to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2007.

This is not the normal situation in which I, as Secretary General, would find myself in front of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality or any other committee.  This is not a normal situation.  An investigation was carried out when the complaints were made to the confidential recipient.  The Garda Commissioner would have had carried out an investigation into those complaints.  Once that investigation was carried out, under the terms of the same set of regulations - I think it is section 10 - the Commissioner is then obliged to refer the allegations and the outcome to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, for its consideration in accordance with agreements that are in place.  On top of this, in this particular case something in the region of ten volumes of files were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who directed no prosecution in respect of these cases.  I have outlined this and have tried to be careful, not for reasons of running down the clock.<\/p><p>  The position in respect of the Garda Commissioner is that an investigation is carried out by someone at chief superintendent level.  It then is investigated by an assistant commissioner in the Garda and a further investigation is taken by a deputy commissioner.  These investigations are endorsed by the Commissioner, who sends back a report and, as I said, at the same time it goes to the DPP.  I referred earlier to the third crucial element of this.  While I am not in any way saying that Mr. Guerin did not look at this, I am saying it is not covered, perhaps because for the reasons he outlined clearly in his report he did not have an opportunity to consider the perspective of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  However, GSOC would have had the allegations and would have had the report on what the Commissioner had done in respect of those allegations.<\/p><p>  As for the Minister, I outlined how the relationships between the Garda Commissioner and the Minister, the Garda Commissioner and the Secretary General of the Department and the Garda Commissioner and the Department are based on trust.  The Commissioner is responsible for the maintenance of order and discipline within the force.  Neither the Department nor the Minister is an investigatory body.  We do not micro-manage the Garda and the Commissioner has responsibility in law for the operation of the Garda.  The Department and the Minister are faced with a situation if we have reports coming back from the Garda Commissioner regarding matters of serious concern such as these, where substantial investigations have been carried out by the Commissioner, where it has gone to the DPP and where we know it also has gone to GSOC.  For the Minister then to make a decision to establish an investigation under section 102, in circumstances in which the Garda Commissioner is stating there is no breach, no criminal offences and no breach of discipline, effectively one would have a situation in which one could loosely say it is not a commission of investigation one needs but a new Commissioner.  I refer to a situation in which one does not accept the bona fides of the Garda Commissioner, who is charged under statute with the management of the force, in circumstances where there have been three elements - I acknowledge I am repeating myself - namely, the Garda investigation, the files going to the DPP and the papers going to GSOC.<\/p><p>  One should bear in mind that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is the independently appointed statutory body that has the remit of investigating complaints of malpractice in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As it would have had it, the assurance was there that it had seen the same allegations and had received the report from the Garda Commissioner.  Had GSOC considered that something was wrong, it would have been in a position to take action.  Consequently, in such circumstances, the Minister would have to decide he was not going to accept what the Garda Commissioner had told him, he would be ignoring the fact that the DPP had decided there was no criminal prosecution to be brought, and he would be ignoring the fact he was aware of the position in respect of the body charged with the investigation of complaints against members of the Garda, which is GSOC, not the Minister for Justice and Equality, not the Department of Justice and Equality and not the Secretary General of that Department.<\/p> <p>Knowing that in those three sets of circumstances those matters had been investigated, the Minister then would have had to say that he did not accept what the Commissioner was saying - the Minister might not have to say that he does not accept what the DPP says because that only relates to criminal offences - and that he was ignoring the fact that the body that is statutorily appointed-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800020#U05200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Purcell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1401296100,"counter":306,"content":"<p>We have been over that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800021#V00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1401296100,"counter":307,"content":"<p>On the last question I put to Mr. Purcell, I did not hear his answer but I did hear him give his answer again.

If one looks at it the whole idea of a confidential recipient receiving in confidence reports from a member of the Garda and then the confidential recipient having to refer it to the Garda Commissioner for investigation by other members of the Garda, while not in any way suggesting that they would not carry out a proper investigation, is, I suppose, what goes to the heart of the changes that are being considered and, indeed, that this committee is looking at.  In hindsight, in response to Senator Zappone, none of us would feel that it is appropriate that investigations of complaints against a member of Garda by another member of the Garda can properly be carried out by carried out by the Garda itself.  I think I have answered the question.  Of course, we do have-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014052800021#V00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Purcell"},{"type":"speech","time":1401296100,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Can I intervene again?

Occurring in parallel was the penalty points issue, in respect of which complaints were made and referred to the Garda.  An investigation was set up by the Garda Commissioner and led by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney, who in turn produced what has become known as the O'Mahoney report into the penalty point allegations.  In addition, another report was sought.  The Garda Commissioner referred the report to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na professional standards unit to examine it in conjunction with the O'Mahoney report.  It made a number of recommendations.  The Minister, in addition to asking the Garda Commissioner to investigate the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe in order that he could be satisfied further that a proper and full investigation had been carried out, asked him to examine a random 1% of all cancellations.  That was done by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahoney.  Following on from that, the Minister referred the O'Mahoney report, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na professional standards unit report and all the relevant documentation to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate so it could examine them to determine whether there was a need for further recommendations.  Subsequently, or around the same time, if I am not mistaken, the Minister referred the O'Mahoney report and the professional standards unit's report to this committee, which in turn sent it to the petitions committee, which held various hearings.

It is the section 102 inquiry I referred to earlier.  The threshold is that the Minister must be satisfied that there may have been a criminal offence committed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a breach of discipline.  That threshold is quite high.  The ombudsman commission has exactly the same power to initiate a section 102 investigation.  That is why I was explaining earlier that we were aware it had the documentation regarding the allegations, which gave some assurance that this matter had been considered by the independent body.  The threshold is quite high.  That was what I was referring to when I was responding to the Senator.  For the Minister to take an allegation or allegations and refer it to GSOC for a section 102 investigation in circumstances in which the Garda Commissioner had already said there was nothing wrong and the DPP had said there was no criminal offence - that rules out the criminal offence element from the beginning - then the Minister would want to be absolutely satisfied that a serious offence was committed to discard the advice of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p><p>  The Commissioner is the person in charge of the force and statutorily charged with maintaining its good order and discipline.

There is then a situation where it goes to the Director of Public Prosecutions who says no prosecutions are warranted.  One is assured by the knowledge that it also went to GSOC and that it had the opportunity to consider whether it felt further action was warranted in the circumstances.  Bearing in mind what I said about the relationship between the Secretary General and the Commissioner or the Minister and the Commissioner, it is built on a level of trust.  As I said in my opening remarks, it is a trust that has been built up over decades and a relationship that was built during a period when there was a real threat to the security of the State.  There was necessarily a close relationship which, as I said, did not happen during the term of one single officeholder.  That was how it had developed over a long period.  When one has this, what I am saying is that the response was reasonable.  I do not know, with the benefit of hindsight, whether we would do the same thing again.  Again, a lot of boils down to the level of trust.  However, I go back to what I said.  The programme of reform will ensure this will not happen again because if one has a situation where the remit of GSOC is extended to cover complaints made by garda&iacute; - it was only in particular circumstances that it could do so - with the enactment of the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 which will establish GSOC as the authority that will deal with Garda whistleblowers, it will not arise again.

My view was that the difference with the Fennelly commission is that the commission itself was established and its terms of reference were set out, the judge is in place and he has commenced his work.  He has written to me and, I believe, to others, so the work of Mr. Justice Fennelly's commission is already under way.  The difference between this and the Guerin commission is that, while I still have concerns that by giving evidence here there is a potential that it in turn may prejudice or undermine the commission, it has not yet been established and its terms of reference have not been set out.  It is a problem, and this is exactly what I meant when I spoke about the difficult position I am in when trying to deal with this.  I have set out why I could not answer questions on Mr. Justice Fennelly's commission or anything relating to the terms of reference, and have tried to adopt as open, honest and frank a manner as I can in trying to facilitate the work of the committee.

Is it not fair to say that the DPP would only recommend a criminal prosecution where the level of evidence was beyond reasonable doubt?  Surely someone in Mr. Purcell's Department or with the former Minister or former Garda Commissioner should have raised concerns that, leaving aside the question of a criminal prosecution arising from the issues raised by the whistleblowers, there was a significant lack of action on the part of someone in the Department, the former Minister or the former Garda Commissioner.

The investigations had been endorsed by the Commissioner who had written to the Minister and in turn, the Minister had written back.  The ten volumes of files were sent to the DPP's office and that office took a decision not to prosecute.  One of the things I mentioned earlier was a crucial point that was not covered in Mr. Guerin's report because, as he outlined in his report, he did not have the GSOC perspective on what happened, namely, that under the confidential recipient regulations of 2007, there is a requirement for any complaints-allegations that are referred by the confidential recipient to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be referred to GSOC, as well as the response to those allegations or complaints.

In addition to the Sergeant McCabe allegations being investigated by the O'Mahoney investigation, the Minister also asked the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate a random 1% of all cancellations, other than the ones that were covered by the allegations and that was done.  The matter was also looked at by the Garda professional standards unit which made recommendations.  The Minister then referred both reports to the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, which in turn produced a report which, as I said earlier, nailed once and for all anyone's doubts about whether it was independent.

The first petition for consideration is P00009\/13 from Mr. Hugh Rance, calling for an independent process of appeal in the Department of Education and Skills through which a teacher who is employed by a vocational education committee and has been refused qualified pay and incremental credit, can make an appeal against the decision reached by the VEC.  In particular he feels the regulations on the free movement of workers within the EU are not being enforced by the Department of Education and Skills and as a result, he is being penalised financially and the reduction in salary will also have an impact on his future pension payment.<\/p><p>  The petitioner forwarded further correspondence to the secretariat on 22 February informing the committee that his situation has been resolved as a result of the appointment of a new chief executive officer to the education and training board.  While he gave no details of the solution reached, he has asked that the committee make appropriate recommendations to the Department of Education and Skills on the circulation of circulars that have an impact on the terms and condition of employment and on pay.<\/p><p>  We have received further correspondence from the Cork Education and Training Board outlining the ways it is dealing with these matters.  We have agreed to forward to the petitioner a copy of the response from the Cork Education and Training Board and then to close the petition.<\/p><p>  The second petition for consideration is P00014\/13 from Ms Ursula Widmer on the medical criteria for disabled drivers and passengers to be granted a concession under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, SI 353.  <\/p><p>  Members will see from the criteria that if an individual has the use of one arm, he or she is not entitled to this concession.  However, if an individual has the use of one leg he or she is entitled to the concession.  This seems to be extremely unfair as either would necessitate the use of a modified vehicle.<\/p><p>  It is proposed the committee will take three steps.  First, we write to the Minister seeking information on the reason that the disablement of the loss of one arm does not satisfy the criteria to qualify under the terms of the scheme; second, that we ask for specific information on the difference in disability, in the context of the scheme, between the loss of one leg as a qualifying criteria whereas the criteria for an upper limb disablement is the loss of both the hand and the arm, given that both disablement necessitates the modification of a car; and, third, we will ask whether he has plans to legislate to balance the disparity in the scheme.  Following the Minister's response, we will deliberate further on the petition.<\/p><p>  The third petition is P00003\/14 from Mr. Christophe Krief concerns a breach of European law on competition, freedom of establishment and free movement of workers.  Mr. Krief states the Building Control Act 2007 is questionable, totally discriminatory and in violation of the fundamental principles of European law and the free movement of workers with the EU Community.  The current verdict of the European Ombudsman is that the Building Control Act 2007 is in breach of European law.<\/p><p>  We have had correspondence on this issue from a number of bodies.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has recently signed into law the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 which came into force in March 2014.  This new law stipulates that only three groups of professions will be authorised to design and certify compliance with building regulations.  The Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists, CIAT, has been excluded for no reason.  This means that Mr. Krief will not be allowed to continue to work in Ireland.  CIAT has prepared a complaint to send to the European Commission.<\/p><p>  The committee has deliberated on the correspondence from a number of bodies.  As we think the correspondence clarifies the matter, it is proposed to forward it to the petitioner and the petition be closed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014052800003#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1401292800,"counter":694,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 4.55 p.m. until 4 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 June 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
