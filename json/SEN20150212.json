I thank him for the work he has done to date on this case, of which the family is appreciative.  <\/p>  <p>As the Minister is aware, Mr. Ibrahim Halawa has now been in an Egyptian prison for 554 days.  For any teenager to be locked up for that length of time is not easy.  It is be bad enough being locked up in one's own country, but it is much more difficult in a foreign country.  This week, for the fourth time, his trial has been postponed.  This is intolerable for him, first, being in prison in Cairo and, second, being so far from home.  In fact, his home place is not far from where I live in Templeogue.  It is outrageous that his trial has been postponed once again.<\/p>  <p>Mr. Halawa is a prisoner of conscious and was detained solely for peacefully exercising his rights.  However, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Given that 493 others are involved in the same trial, one has to ask how, in the name of God, will anybody receive a fair trail in such a system.  He was only 17 years old when he was put in prison.  He was arrested with his three sisters who are now home.  With the whole family, they have played a huge role in trying to have him released.  I will keep the issue on the agenda until such time as he is released because I cannot see why he should remain in detention.  According to the case file seen by Amnesty International Ireland, most of the 100 witnesses who are due to be called at the trial are police officers or government officials.  One has to ask what kind of trial he will receive.  <\/p>  <p>I acknowledge the work the Minister has done on this case, on which I have been keeping an eye.  I am aware that he has been very active on it, as has the Irish ambassador.  Is there is any other avenue we could explore, or is there a need to go down the same avenue again to keep the issue on the agenda with a view to having Mr. Halawa released?  Perhaps the Minister might state what has been done to date and what action could follow.  Mr. Halawa's family is very grateful for the efforts made by the Minister to date but think more could be done.  This is a most deserving case.  As Amnesty International Ireland has stated, the most Mr. Halawa could be accused of is being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He has been locked up for crimes he did not commit.  I am not judge and jury, but I such incidents happen when one is in the wrong place at the wrong time, particularly in that country's system of justice.  We must do everything we can to get him home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200002#A00400","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1423737000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  <\/p>  <p>Mr. Ibrahim Halawa, an Irish citizen, and his three sisters were detained following incidents at the Al Fateh Mosque on Ramses Square in Cairo on 17 August 2013.

Mr. Halawa has received 34 consular visits from Irish Embassy staff, including Ambassador Moylan, approximately one visit every two weeks, the most recent being on 7 February.  It is the Government's view that he should not be tried in a group trial involving a large number of defendants and on the basis of group charges but solely on the basis of specific evidence.  The concern is that the Egyptian authorities continue to consider his case to be part of a group trial, but the fact remains that he was only 17 years old when the alleged offences took place.<\/p>  <p>I also recently raised the case with EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Mogherini who undertook to raise it with the appropriate authorities.<\/p> <p>She stressed that we can count on all the assistance that the EU institutions can provide.

For the past few years these have been in very short supply in County Meath.  There have been long delays.  I have seen people lying in beds who cannot leave their homes because essential work cannot be done to their houses.  According to the RTE investigations unit, Meath receives the lowest amount of disabled person grants per head of population.  It receives &euro;3.11 per head compared with Mayo which receives &euro;17.5 per head and Limerick, the home of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for housing, of the time, &euro;16.79 per head, and Kildare, which has a lower age profile, receives &euro;8.65 per head, that is almost treble what Meath receives.<\/p>  <p>People are housebound or may not be able to go upstairs, use a bathroom properly or shower themselves because they cannot step into a bath.  Those are the practical difficulties people in Meath face because it is starved of funding.  Why does Meath get such little funding?  Is it the Government&rsquo;s fault?  Does the local authority have a role?  Should it give more matching funding?  I would like to know this so that I can make the case to it.<\/p>  <p>As we speak, elderly and disabled people are prevented from being fully mobile in their homes or living properly because there is a severe shortage of these grants.  In one house a man has lain in bed for some time due to his illness.  Adaptation works were due to be done to make it possible for his family to take him out of the house with relative ease.  That has been going on for at least year and work started recently.  In another case a person had both legs amputated and the work took a long time although the council did regard that as a very serious case.  That is the level of seriousness that qualifies one for an adaptation grant.  I and the people of Meath would like answers from the Minister of State.  If he is going to blame the local authority I will tell the local authority it needs to put in more matching funding. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200003#B00500","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1423737000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Byrne for raising this matter and I am happy to clarify it for him.  Exchequer funding of over &euro;37 million was provided in 2014 for the housing adaptation grants for older people and people with a disability.  This was combined with a contribution of an additional 20% by individual local authorities, to give an overall spend of &euro;46.3 million.<\/p>  <p>I am pleased to confirm that at national level, the 2015 amount will increase by some 10% to give a combined spend of &euro;50.5 million.  Individual allocations to local authorities will be made shortly.  Allocations in 2014 were made on the basis of the level of grant activity by local authorities in 2013, and taking account of population statistics with a weighting applied in respect of the numbers of persons aged over 65 years.  Also in making 2014 allocations, the Department ensured that no local authority received less funding than its 2013 allocation.<\/p>  <p>Historically, allocations have been based on the level of contractual commitments notified to my Department by each local authority.  Local authorities were encouraged to maintain continuity in approving and paying grants and therefore commitments carried forward into the new financial year always had first call on the available funding.<\/p>  <p>This system rewarded those local authorities which kept the schemes open and continued to approve eligible applications.  In other cases, local authorities adopted a more cautious approach and closed schemes when applications reached a certain level.  The Department therefore sought to ensure that those applicants who had been approved for grant aid would receive it.  In the past two years we have moved further towards a method of allocations which takes more account of population of each county, with a weighting towards those aged over 65, as the majority of applicants are in this category.  My intention is that the 2015 capital allocations for the grants will be made in a way that continues to take account of the population figures in each local authority.<\/p>  <p>At local level, the detailed administration of these schemes, including the assessment, approval and payment of individual grants to applicants, is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.  However, between the Exchequer contribution and its own funding, the amount available to Meath County Council in 2014 under this scheme was 73% higher than in 2013, and I anticipate a further increase in the full amount of funding for 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200003#B00600","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1423737000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Minister of State makes the case that the age profile is relevant and while it is important, the one constant in the figure RTE has released is that if there is a Minister in the area, no matter what the age profile or level of disability in the area, it will do well out of this scheme.

In areas in which there is a higher percentage of over 65s and the populations are larger such as in County Meath there should be an adequate weighting in the grant allocations to meet that demand.  Commitments had already been made to people under the grants scheme, including in County Meath and other local authorities, that we had to see through once approvals were made.

No town should have to endure the terrifying scenes visited on Portlaoise&rsquo;s main street on Thursday last.  They have led to a local outcry and I have been inundated with hundreds of representations.  For many, the incident was the last straw.  Up to 60 people were involved in a wholesale chaotic brawl, fisticuffs and dangerous scenes of violence along the town&rsquo;s main street outside the courthouse.<\/p>  <p>I raised this matter with the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, on numerous occasions in this House.  I was told that, in the first instance, there was a question about money and then one about finding a suitable site.  In this day and age, the town's main street is not a suitable location for a courthouse operating on a daily basis.  All of the smaller courthouses around the county have been closed owing to rationalisation and are now centralised in Portlaoise.<\/p>  <p>What we had on Thursday last was a fracas which reached a new low, but this is not a new phenomenon.  It is a daily occurrence, to the point where the people of Portlaoise, senior citizens, shoppers, others going about their business, students, mothers and parents with buggies, cannot move up and down the main street safely owing to anti-social behaviour by gurriers and gougers who hang around in large groups.  It is chaotic and has now reached the point where it is no longer safe to move up and down the main street.  It is pointless to talk about the revival of the town centre and business and the relocation the library while the courthouse remains at the heart of the town in the hub of what should be the social and shopping centre.  It is no place for a courthouse and I have appealed on numerous occasions to have it relocated.<\/p>  <p>What happened last week was the last straw.  I do not want to exaggerate the dangers.  However, what will it take for the courthouse to be relocated?  Will somebody have to be seriously injured or worse?  Unfortunately, we saw the tragic events that unfolded elsewhere in the country yesterday.  We are on the cusp of such a terrible tragedy happening in Portlaoise.  The local newspapers have splashed headlines such as, &ldquo;Mayhem on Main Street&rdquo;.  How can one run a town or a business or go about one&rsquo;s business in that scenario?  The Garda, prison officers and local businesses want the courthouse relocated.  Everyone in the community knows the main street in Portlaoise is not a suitable or safe place for a courthouse.  For decades, the town was promised a new Garda station.  Garda&iacute; in the town are working in substandard conditions, but the solution is in our own hands.  The courthouse must be co-located with the new Garda station.  The Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice and Equality must expedite this matter as a matter of urgency to ensure the new Garda station is built on a suitable site and co-located with a modern courthouse off the main street.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200004#C00400","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1423737600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.<\/p>  <p>Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in its functions, including in the provision, maintenance and management of court buildings.  The Minister had inquiries made about the current arrangements for Portlaoise Courthouse.  It should be noted that the courthouse situated on Main Street is a neoclassical building built in 1805.  It was last refurbished by the Courts Service in 2001 at a cost of &euro;2.75 million.  More recently in 2010, minor works were carried out to relocate staff to the former grand jury room in the building.<\/p>  <p>The Courts Service does not agree that the courthouse building is unsafe.  However, there is limited scope for development within the existing building and site.  The location of the courthouse in the centre of the town also poses issues for access and security, as the Senator outlined.  It was proposed, therefore, as part of the Courts Service courthouse refurbishment programme, to provide a courthouse on an alternative site.  In 2007 the Courts Service, in co-operation with the OPW, began a search to find an appropriate alternative site in the town for a new courthouse development.  Several potential sites were considered during 2007 and 2008.  However, no site was acquired at the time.<\/p>  <p>Since 2008 the Courts Service, in common with all other public service organisations, has been operating in a difficult and challenging economic environment.  Despite the limited funding available, the Courts Service has continued its search for a new site for a courthouse.  The OPW is actively looking for an appropriate site, but, as yet, no suitable sites have become available.  In the absence of a suitable site, it is not possible to bring forward specific proposals for the replacement of Portlaoise Courthouse.  The availability of a suitable site and funding will dictate the timeline for the provision of a new courthouse.  In the meantime, the Courts Service is aware of the ongoing disquiet about the appropriateness of the location of the courthouse in Portlaoise and the cell facilities it contains.  The Courts Service works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service on the best management of court days in the town.  In addition, the Courts Service has included the provision of additional holding cell facilities in its programme of works for 2015.  Consultation has taken place and the OPW is progressing the matter.  This work will impact positively on security and traffic flow around the court, as prisoners will not have to be held elsewhere and transported to and from the court, to the Garda station or prison vans, as cases are called.<\/p>  <p>Since the establishment of the Courts Service up to 2011, a substantial programme of investment in court facilities amounting to &euro;250 million, with over 50 venues being newly built or refurbished, has been carried out.  Many others were substantially upgraded.  This level of investment has enabled the Courts Service to greatly improve the standard of accommodation available, including facilities for people with disabilities, jury facilities, custody cells, consultation rooms, etc.  There is also an ongoing programme of investment in technology at court venues.  In this period 41 court venues were refurbished, 13 new courthouses were built, the Criminal Courts of Justice were completed as a PPP, public private partnership, project, while many smaller venues were upgraded.  The Courts Service is procuring seven new courthouses nationwide as part of a &euro;135 million capital PPP programme included in the Government&rsquo;s infrastructure stimulus package announced in July 2012 in Cork, Limerick, Wexford, Waterford, Mullingar, Letterkenny and Drogheda.<\/p> <p>The Courts Service is working with the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of Public works and the National Development Finance Agency to progress these projects and substantial preparatory work has already been carried out.  It is expected that contracts will be signed in October this year with the projects being delivered in 18 to 24 months depending on the project.<\/p> <p>I have listened to the Senator's comments in regard to Portlaoise.  In the context of the work being carried out by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Ann Phelan, to regenerate towns and villages across the country, it is important to provide a safe and secure environment for residents and visitors alike.  I suggest the Senator should convene a meeting between the local authority, the OPW and the Courts Service with a view to identifying a suitable site in the town.  It appears that the location of the site will be key to solving the issue and an intervention from someone as familiar with the town as the Senator could offer a way forward.  If there is anything I can do to help, I would be more than happy to oblige.  I will be in Portlaoise in the near future and if the Senator wants to show me the problem in person, I would be happy to meet him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200004#C00500","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423738200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I appreciate the personal interest shown by the Minister of State and his receptive response to the concerns of people of Portlaoise and County Laois.

Could the House be given some clarification on that?<br\/><br\/>It is disturbing today to read in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>that the HSE director general wrote to the Department of Health seeking &euro;1.4 billion in additional funding last September.  We then had the Minister announcing what he believed to be a realistic budget in October, yet it was only &euro;115 million more than the previous year despite the fact that the HSE had sought &euro;1.4 billion.  Despite that supposedly realistic budget announcement last October, the following month, the director general, Tony O'Brien, felt compelled to tell the Minister, &quot;It has not been possible to provide funding to address the substantial majority of the demographic and critical service cost pressures, some of which carry risks from a clinical perspective&quot;.  We need to clarify where these risks are.  Was Mr. O'Brien referring to the 500 plus patients on hospital trolleys, which have become commonplace over the course of the last weeks and months?<\/p> <p>Was it the fair deal scheme, where there are very substantial waiting lists?  What is the situation?<br\/><br\/>How bad does the HSE anticipate things will get when it is some &euro;1.3 million short of the funding it anticipated it would need?  I do not want to be calling votes on having the Minister in here today, but I ask that an additional health budget debate be held as soon as possible, so that the Minister can outline for us how a budget announced in October was stated to be realistic, when it seems to be &euro;1.3 billion short of the figures put forward by the HSE to his Department in September.<br\/><br\/>While the Leader may feel a Commencement debate<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>may be more appropriate for this issue, such is its seriousness that I would like to see a debate in the House in which all could participate.  It arises from the Sligo County Council's debt of some &euro;100 million and the central Government's treatment of the people of Sligo on the back of that debt.  It is prescribing, centrally, the closing of basic First World county services, like libraries, motor taxation offices, outdoor staff and so on.  It is prescribing the closure and cutting back of these services, it is prescribing more redundancies and it is treating Sligo County Council and the people of Sligo as if it were some independent republic out in the middle of the Atlantic.  At the same time, there are larger councils, such as Fingal County Council, with over &euro;100 million on deposit.<br\/><br\/>The reality is that the funding mechanism for smaller local authorities like Sligo, and there are many others in similar situations throughout the country, is not robust enough.  They do not have the benefit of Dublin Airport, for example, within their commercial rate base, which Fingal does.  That is just one example.  We have a situation in Sligo where central Government support is essential.  The attitude taken to this by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and his Department in treating the people of Sligo in such a discriminatory manner, is effectively to do to us in the north west what the Germans and the ECB did to the people of Ireland in prescribing the medicine they felt should best be taken.  The people of the north west are no less entitled to services than the people of the east coast, the Leader's own area, or other parts of the country.

On the question of whether the Labour Party favours the sale of the State's shares in Aer Lingus, it is a Government decision, but a number of senior Labour Ministers have said they do not see any commercial imperative in selling the State's interest and are aware that the State's interests in the matter need to be protected.<\/p>  <p>I thank Members for a robust debate yesterday on the issue of housing.  While I am reluctant to ask again for a debate on housing, a number of issues were raised, particularly in regard to home ownership, tenant-purchase, and other issues around low- or middle-income households having access to home ownership.  The credit unions have recently said they would be willing to enter the market in terms of mortgage lending.  They were very quickly slapped down from a regulatory perspective for putting their necks above the parapet on this issue.<\/p>  <p>This merits a two-fold debate, with the first dealing with the credit unions.  There were a few high-profile credit union failures but the vast majority of Irish credit unions are very sound and have been serving their communities very well for significant periods of time.  They know their membership in a way that banks do not know their customers, and we need to look at whether the current regulatory framework is adequate for the needs of credit unions and their membership.  I would like a debate on home ownership.  Many Members would have something to add on that.<\/p>  <p>I welcome the announcement of a ceasefire in Ukraine.  We have seen many ceasefires before.  Let us hope this one goes somewhere.  Around 5,300 people have been killed so far in this conflict on European soil.  I would like to see a wider debate on European issues, covering the security issues Europe is facing together with issues like the Greek bailout.  We have seen the announcement of the President Juncker investment plan.  Ireland has a number of projects of significant value already lodged for that fund and we have the issue of quantitative easing.  There are a number of European issues that would merit a debate in the House.<\/p>  <p>I found the comments of the economist John FitzGerald at the banking inquiry yesterday very refreshing.  He put his hands up and said he had made the wrong call, was totally wrong and had made a big mistake that will live with him for the rest of his life.  I want to put something on the record.  John FitzGerald is an eminent economist.

I am alarmed by this campaign because it is funded by Diageo, a drinks company.  It has many good people associated with it but I did two reports for the European Economic and Social Committee on alcohol-related harm and I saw at first hand how the industry will try to influence, orchestrate and campaign to ensure that any effective reports one is trying to do are diluted.  The industry did not win in that case, but when I saw the campaign title, Stop Out of Control Drinking, it made me think that most people in Ireland would think the campaign was not directed at them.<\/p>  <p>What we should be talking about is alcohol-related harm.  Allowing a drinks company to frame a debate and put major money behind a public health campaign is wrong.  I would point those involved to the World Health Organisation which indicated that it would be inappropriate for the industry to have a role in the formulation of alcohol policies either nationally or locally.  The industry's involvement in this campaign is wrong.  Those involved with the campaign would say it is independent but let us remember that Diageo, the drinks company involved with this, exists to sell alcohol and to make profits for its shareholders.  That is the reason for the business.  I do not argue with that but it is not a public health company.<\/p>  <p>Let the people frame this debate, not a drinks company.  It is unacceptable that any of us would support a campaign that is so clearly the narrative of the drinks company.  That is what it wants us to talk about, the out of control drinking, not the effect drink has on family households and the triggers the special rapporteur on child protection mentioned to us at the health and children committee.  We cannot have an ambivalent response to alcohol, we need to look at it seriously.  It is having a destructive effect in many households.  That is the area I deal with.

Two of these events are the Galway International Film Fleadh which will receive &euro;20,000 and the Galway Oyster Festival which will receive &euro;30,000.  This comes in a week when Galway has been awarded the purple flag award, a prestigious accolade given to cities and towns which meet or surpass the standards of excellence in managing their evening and night-time economy.  With this award, Galway has proved to be a friendly, entertaining and enjoyable place to visit, in which regard our festivals play a significant role.  That is why this funding is critical.  The benefits to Galway of receiving this accolade are wide-ranging, including attracting domestic and overseas visitors and lower crime rates.  The city met all 30 criteria and was particularly commended for showing strong evidence of leadership and a high incidence of business engagement.  Galway's alcohol strategy which was put in place to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm was recommended as a role model of joined up strategic thinking.  It is a very good initiative which, I understand, is being rolled out across the country.This announcement is further good news for Galway.

It is a very significant conference, especially in the light of the fact that all political parties and Independents are shaping their approaches to taxation and fiscal policies in the run-up to the next general election.  I wonder how many of the manifestoes that will be drawn up shortly will include a section on human rights and the explicit link between human rights and taxation policy, as emphasised at length by Professor Alston.

Ireland is at a critical juncture and such a debate would necessarily raise again one of the most fundamental questions all political parties must answer: is this an economy or a society?  This morning the Minister of State said economic recovery must be society-led, with which I agree, but what does that actually mean?  He said we needed to invest in the economy in order that we could do something with it.  That is a traditional and tired economic model.  I heard that Fine Gael was going to offer the people a new model.  What is meant by \"a new model\"?  A new model is not investing in the economy in order that one can do something with it but investing in society to have a healthy economy.  We need a Copernican turn to our model.  Investing in society would mean Irish citizens' fundamental rights to health, education and social protection would come first, not last.  The Minister of State said Ireland invested in these things, but the Government refuses to put the issue of a constitutional guarantee for economic and social rights to the people, as the Constitutional Convention recommended.  When we invest in the economy, job creation, multinationals, research and development, knowledge boxes, etc., we need to do so in a way that will not increase income and wealth inequality, domestically or internationally, and all that flows from this.  Please let us have a debate on tax justice and the human rights impact of tax and fiscal policies soon.  Within this debate let us hear from the Government on why it will not put question of guaranteeing the economic and social rights of citizens to them to decide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200008#M00300","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1423739400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I congratulate and commend all those involved in the running of the 90th national coursing meeting in Clonmel which was held over two weekends owing to bad weather.

Criminals are using stolen mobile phones to communicate with their accomplices and so forth.  In California a new law has been passed that mandates kill switches in mobile phones.  If one's phone is stolen, one can kill it remotely. This technology is not available in every mobile phone.  It is only available in the iPhone 6, the Samsung Galaxy S5, and several other very new smart phones.  Microsoft is expected to put it in its phones soon.  Some US states have made kill switches mandatory in all mobile phones.  I was at a public meeting in Firhouse last week which was entirely taken up with a discussion on burglaries, crime and so forth.  Many people spoke about the way crime is being facilitated by mobile phones.  I am not calling for a full debate on this issue but rather am asking if the Leader would make representations to the Minister to examine whether we could introduce similar legislation.  We should also highlight this kill technology because many people who have these newer smart phones would not even know that this technology is included.  It is possible to kill one's phone remotely and the phone is rendered absolutely useless.  Phones are also being stolen for resale and this technology renders them useless.  As a result of this technology, it has been found that phone-related crime has decreased.<\/p>  <p>I concur with the remarks of Senator van Turnhout and others but would point out that the Taoiseach made some very good choices in his appointment of Senators to this House.  Senator van Turnhout is not on the University Panel and Senators on that side of the House cannot claim to have all of the brains.  Both the elected and nominated Senators have university degrees, unlike in times of old.

I also welcome the fact that the opportunity has arisen to point out the scandalously low pay rate for the new garda recruits.  My colleague, Senator MacSharry raised this a number of weeks ago and was the first in this House to do so, following a high profile visit by the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to Templemore when the first recruits were being initiated.  There has been a deafening silence from the Government on this.  I have not heard one word since about this pay rate of  &euro;23,000.  Here we are, congratulating garda&iacute; for taking their lives in their hands - for &euro;23,000.  That is a scandal and one that needs to be addressed in a budgetary framework.  Perhaps the Leader will comment on that.  <\/p> <p> I commend the comments of my colleague, Senator Hayden, on the leading economist who appeared before the banking inquiry yesterday.  The man is a real patriot and he has made an outstanding contribution to the life of this State during his time with the ESRI.  The meeting yesterday cannot have been easy for him.  He raised fundamental issues which I hope will be addressed by the banking inquiry.  They are fundamental issues about what seems to be - and I use the word cautiously - an arrogant approach by officials in the then Department of Finance on the impending crisis that was going to explode on this country between the years 2005 and 2008.  They not only studiously ignored advice that was being given but treated it with a level of contempt.  I hope that the banking inquiry will invite them in because they are still around and ask them to justify their actions.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the committee will also look at what came into the public domain.  I refer to the letters or correspondence between the then housing Minister, Deputy Noel Ahern, and the Department of Finance at the time of the introduction of 100% mortgages.  The economist pointed out not once but repeatedly that this development posed a real danger to the Irish mortgage system and that it would create enormous financial and economic difficulties if it was allowed to go unchecked.  What did the Department of Finance do?  The officials treated his advice with total contempt.  There are issues surrounding the advice that was given at that time by the Department of Finance to the political environment.  The matter needs to be teased out and addressed.<\/p> <p>I wish to compliment Niall Gibbons and his people at Tourism Ireland who have once again pulled off yet another great coup of extending the number of greening iconic site across the world.  There is upwards of 60 sites that will go green for St. Patrick's Day.  Given the size of this country there will be a focus on Ireland as a result of the colour green appearing at iconic monuments throughout the world.  It is a wonderful commendation for Tourism Ireland and Niall Gibbons.  Among the iconic attractions that will go green on St. Patrick's Day will be the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tennessee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200009#N01000","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423740600,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thought the Senator was going to mention Drumshambo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200010#O00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1423740600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>Next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200010#O00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1423740600,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Perhaps at the Ballroom of Romance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200010#O00400","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1423740600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister for Education and Skills on 10 February on the immediate establishment of the inclusion support service under the remit of the National Council for Special Education.

Some years ago a rebate system operated when one returned glass bottles.  We could do worse than introduce a rebate system to encourage the recycling of plastic bottles and containers which are deposited.  Dublin City Council, in particular, could introduce a scheme and perhaps give 10 cent per glass or plastic bottle recycled.  In an international context, a number of cities across the world have successfully implemented the scheme and people receive anywhere between 5 cent and 20 cent per glass or plastic bottle returned.  The money spent on the rebate can easily be offset against the benefit of having a cleaner environment in a physical and ecological sense.  Dublin City Council had a budgetary surplus coming into this year so there are funds available for this scheme.  A trial period of three months could be set aside.  If there was a rebate of 5 cent per bottle then a &euro;30,000 funding package could see over 600,000 returned.

On 5 February he announced that the Cabinet had approved proposals to require restaurants, takeaway establishments and all food service outlets to post calorie details of all meals on menus alongside the price point where food was ordered.  In his press release the Minister stated he was very concerned about the level of obesity in Ireland.  He said the latest figures indicated that two out of every three adults and one in four children were overweight or obese.  Michelin star chef Derry Clarke said he was completely against the move which was beyond ridiculous.  If one wants people to lose weight, sofas, televisions and laptops should be taxed.  It is not all about calories; it is about moving.  The Government's plan to introduce calorie counts on restaurant menus is a complete farce.  It does not take the reality of the restaurant industry into account and will cause huge damage to restaurants, especially the smaller independent establishments for which Ireland has gained a reputation for quality during the years.  I understand completely that McDonald's and KFC have the same menus day in and day out and, as such, could cope with the plan to fix menu items.  However, many restaurants with creativity and innovation have a pinch of this and a dash of that and change their menu items such that calorie counts are not consistent.  These restaurants are extremely busy and run on shoe-string budgets.  They cannot afford to have dedicated staff members to calculate calorie counts.  I hate to have to say many of our chefs are leaving the country because of the pressure on restaurants by rates and expensive overheads.  It is a gift from God to be a brilliant chef, as well as requiring an education.  Many of our chefs, including chefs from England and France, are moving abroad, while there are people from abroad coming to this country who are not trained as chefs.  They are taking up positions and it is very sad that our own are leaving.  <\/p>  <p>I will be tracking the Minister because he has also abdicated his responsibility for the extension of BreastCheck.

Senators will be aware that the position of Ombudsman for Children fell vacant on the resignation of Ms Emily Logan in September 2014, following her appointment as chief commissioner of the newly established Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Dr. Muldoon was selected following a comprehensive independent recruitment and selection process which was conducted at my request by the Public Appointments Service.  The Government at its meeting of 3 February 2015 approved the nomination of Dr. Niall Muldoon for appointment by the President as Ombudsman for Children in accordance with the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.<\/p>  <p>The relevant legislative provisions with regard to appointment to the Office of Ombudsman for Children are contained in section 4 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, section 4(2) of which provides that, \"The appointment of a person to be the Ombudsman for Children shall be made by the President upon resolution passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and by Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommending the appointment of the person\".  This is the reason I am bringing the motion before the House.  Section 4(4) of the Act states that a person appointed to be the Ombudsman for Children shall hold the office of Ombudsman for Children for a term of six years and may be reappointed once only to that office for a second term.<\/p> <p>The first Ombudsman for Children. Ms. Emily Logan, was appointed on 18 December 2003 for a six-year term of office and was reappointed with effect from 18 December 2009 for a further six-year term.  There was unanimous support in both Houses for these appointments.  I would like to acknowledge Ms. Logan and record my appreciation for the work she has done as the first Ombudsman for Children and her achievements over ten years in building that office and working tirelessly for the rights and welfare of children.  I wish her every success in her new career.<br\/><br\/>The Office of the Ombudsman for Children was established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to promote and safeguard the rights and welfare of children.  The Ombudsman for Children is independent of the Government and is accountable to the Oireachtas.  The office is in place to provide an additional protection for children and, in this context, it is crucial that the Ombudsman for Children has the ability to advocate independently for children.  The key functions of the role are to promote and safeguard the rights and welfare of children, to examine and investigate complaints about services provided to children, to provide advice regarding children's rights and conduct research on relevant issues.<br\/><br\/>The remit of the Ombudsman for Children has been significantly expanded and largely aligned with the remit of the Ombudsman with effect from May 2013 as a result of the changes enacted in the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012.  The responsibility for the Office of the Ombudsman for Children transferred to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs from the Minister for Health with effect from 3 June 2011.  The role of the Minister is limited primarily to governance matters, particularly staffing and finance, given the Ombudsman for Children's statutory independence.<br\/><br\/>The process which resulted in Dr. Muldoon's selection began in August 2014 with meetings between officials in my Department and colleagues in the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  In September 2014, I announced that the PAS would engage in an independent process to find a suitable replacement to fill this important role.  The PAS is recognised as a centre of excellence for public service recruitment and selection across a range of posts from entry level to professional, technical and senior executive positions.  The recruitment process was conducted in accordance with the codes of practice of the Commission for Public Service Appointments and the PAS ensured that the process adhered to the principles of fairness, quality and recruitment on merit.<br\/><br\/>The PAS advertised the position on 31 October 2014 on its website, <i>www.publicjobs.ie<\/i>.  The job was promoted through international channels, in order to give the widest scope for potential applicants in comparable jurisdictions.  Applications for the post were received from a wide range of candidates inside and outside the State with a diverse range of backgrounds.  I was pleased and encouraged at the interest in this important role.  Some 97 eligible applicants were considered by a selection board for shortlisting.  Some 12 candidates were shortlisted for preliminary interview on the 16 and 17 of December.  Five of these candidates were then selected for final interview and assessment, which took place on 28 January 2015.  Dr. Niall Muldoon was the successful candidate to emerge from this rigorous process.<br\/><br\/>A unique element of this recruitment process was the involvement of children at all stages.  There were two consultation workshops with children and young people on 20 and 21 October 2014 to provide input into the final personal specification and the advertisement for the post.  I attended both of these consultations, the first with a younger group aged eight to 12 years and the second with an older group aged 13 to 17.  At these consultations, a panel of children was selected to become involved in a role play assessment as part of the final selection process.<br\/><br\/>The final assessment included a role play session for each candidate with 11 children based on topics developed by the children themselves.  The final interview included a presentation.  Two children were involved with the interview board in assessing the presentation but the children were not involved in assessing the other competencies examined by the adult members of the final interview board.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Muldoon is currently director of investigations at the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  He has been in this role for two and a half years and oversees the handling of almost 1,600 complaints per year made by, or on behalf of, children and young people about public bodies such as the HSE, schools and voluntary hospitals.  He ensures that a culture of independence, impartiality and child centredness underpins the work at all times.  Prior to joining the Office of the Ombudsman for Children Dr. Muldoon spent five years as national clinical director of CARI, a children's charity, based in Dublin, Limerick and Cork, providing therapy and support to children and families affected by sexual abuse.<br\/><br\/>He is a registered clinical and counselling psychologist who has worked in the area of child protection for almost 20 years.  He spent ten years working in the Granada Institute providing therapy, risk assessments and support to adults who had sexually offended against children and those who had been abused as children.  He was regularly called upon to provide expert testimony in the courts.  He also has extensive experience of lecturing up to doctoral level in both TCD and UCD.  His experience shows he has the range of professional and academic experience that makes him suitable for the position.  The rigorous assessment and selection process conducted by the PAS concluded he was the best candidate for the job.  I wish him every success in this important and vital role.  I am happy to recommend the adoption of this resolution by the House.  I thank the children who participated in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200013#R00300","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423742700,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

I then went on to the Christian Brothers, who were extremely good but they used physical violence.  A famous leather was made especially for the Christian Brothers and we got ten of the best.  It was not easy.  My granddaughter is now attending school and she adores it.  She goes in to learn with joy and the attitude has changed.  We have come a long way but we needed to come a long way.  I will never forgive those in Letterfrack and other institutions who abused the children of this country and treated them with such contempt.  We are only now catching up.  In the 1950s and 1960s, this was a cold Ireland for children.  We have come a long way and it is good that we have an Ombudsman for Children.  The appointment was made by a Fianna F&aacute;il Administration.  Sometimes I get the impression that Fianna F&aacute;il has been written out of the work it did.  It was a very progressive Fianna F&aacute;il Party that brought forward the Children Act.  My party introduced the Act and recommended the appointment of an Ombudsman for Children.  That should be noted.<\/p>  <p>With regard to the recent statement by Pope Francis, he has long been regarded as the most lovable pontiff but his statement was not made under the aegis of infallibility.<\/p> <p>He made the statement as a human being.  It was an off the cuff comment to which the former President of Ireland, Dr. Mary McAleese, responded strongly.  I believe she responded in a positive way.  In regard to the pontiff, I would not like to take the comment out of context, because he is a kind, gentle person.  However, he is quite an age and probably slapping was regarded as acceptable in his youth.  <\/p> <p>This is not acceptable conduct, but I am not sure the Minister can bring about a situation where it is eliminated.  It is very difficult to bring forward legislation on the slapping of children within a family.  However, I believe slapping in public could be controlled.  It should be made illegal for any parent to slap their children in public and this should be something that is reportable to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  There is no excuse for this, but there are different situations to be considered, such as the fact that children can wear people out, that people have other commitments, the number of children in a family, etc.  Perhaps the Minister will take account of this point of view.  Members who are parents know the situation.  This is a difficult issue.  If we bring in legislation that makes it illegal to slap a child in the home, where do we go from there?  Where do we stand in regard to bringing the law into that situation?<\/p> <p>The first step should be to make it illegal for parents to reprimand their children physically in public.  This behaviour is not acceptable.  Many people would intervene in such situations, but they are often told to get lost.  What is the Minister's view on this?  It is a sensitive area.  When corporal punishment in schools was banned - John Boland was Minister for Education at the time - it was a step in the right direction and one I very much applaud.  We wish Dr. Niall Muldoon every success in his new role.  The position of Ombudsman for Children is an important role and carries significant responsibility, namely, the protection of children.  Some fantastic candidates put themselves forward for the position, each of whom might have been suitable.  Dr. Muldoon has been selected and now has the unanimous support of the Oireachtas before being officially appointed by the President.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200014#S00400","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423743300,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I propose that the Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles Bill 2014 be now taken at 2.30 p.m. rather than 2 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200015#T00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1423743300,"counter":102,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I am pleased to speak on the motion that Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommends Dr. Niall Muldoon for appointment by the President as Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>  <p>Since the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 paved the way for the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, which was established in 2004, the first Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, and the staff of the office established a pivotal role for the office in the lives of the children of this country.  Ms Logan must be commended for her achievements during her term of office, on establishing and expanding the role and on working tirelessly for the welfare and rights of children.  The office was established at a time when it had emerged that our children were in many ways not given the priority, nurturing, love and cherishing they needed.  They had no voice and there was nobody to ensure their welfare came first, their voices could be heard and their rights could be enforced.<\/p>  <p>The ombudsman's annual report makes very interesting reading.  The information obtained through the receipt, examination and investigation of complaints by the office provides a valuable insight into the experiences of children and families in dealing with public services.  The scrutiny of the administrative actions of public bodies can provide an opportunity for organisations to review the service they are providing and, hopefully, improve them in areas where it is shown they are not providing the best service.  In its first year, the office handled 94 complaints.  In 2013, it handled 1,677 cases.  This level of complaint and subsequent investigations by the office must mean that many wrongs have being righted, entitlements that were not being received are being received, that loopholes are being closed and that the next child or parent who comes across a barrier to an entitlement will find it easier to lift that barrier.<\/p>  <p>I understand that Dr. Niall Muldoon has been through a rigorous interview process and am pleased to know that children were involved at some stage of that process.  He was the director of investigations in the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and as such has a unique and deep understanding of the workings of the office.  I believe he has worked in the area of child protection for almost 20 years.  I am confident that those involved in the interview process set out to find the best candidate for the position and believe Dr. Muldoon is that person.  I am therefore happy to speak in his favour and wish him every success in his new position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200015#T00400","speaker":"1152"},{"type":"speech","time":1423743300,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I support the motion and welcome the appointment of Dr. Niall Muldoon as Ombudsman for Children.  I congratulate him and wish him every success.  Like others, I take this opportunity to thank and commend Emily Logan, who over her ten-year tenure had to fight to build and protect the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  She built it up and ensured it had a strong role.<\/p>  <p>This is a critical year for the Ombudsman for Children and for children's rights in Ireland, as we go before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  The Ombudsman for Children will appear before the committee in June and the State in January 2016.  It is important we have somebody of the calibre of Dr. Niall Muldoon to ensure we have a strong voice representing us in Geneva on behalf of children and children's rights.<\/p>  <p>There are some issues in regard to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and a role for the Government to provide support.  The first issue I would like to raise is the issue of direct provision.  I urge the Minister to consider using the Office of the Ombudsman for Children as an independent oversight and complaints mechanism in this regard.  It is doing that role for the Child and Family Agency and I believe it could do it also for direct provision.  This is an issue we have often raised in this House.  Another issue arises on reading the annual reports.  We see from the report on last year that 43% of complaints came from the education sector.  Many administrative decisions are made across government, particularly those made through Department of Education and Skills circulars, which directly affect children and their families, but these decisions do not have to go through any scrutiny in the Houses or by government.  We need to address and examine this issue.<\/p>  <p>Another issue concerns the voice of the child.  Children's voices have been absent in many investigations in cases brought to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  Therefore, the office must strive harder to ensure these voices are heard.  Besides producing reports that are aimed at the Oireachtas or the Minister, the office should also direct its reports towards children so that they know what the ombudsman is saying on their behalf. <\/p>  <p>Senator Leyden mentioned corporal punishment.  As the Minister knows, several months ago, I alerted him to an amendment I proposed to submit on the Children First Bill because I believe there is a way we can deal with this issue.  It is shameful we have not yet dealt with this issue.  Just 100 years ago, people could beat their wives, their dogs and their children.  We still allow the beating of children.  This says a lot about our society.<\/p>  <p>I would like to wish Dr. Niall Muldoon every success in the office.  He can be assured of my full staff.  The office has an outstanding staff who do incredible work.  The office is very small, but has tremendous impact.  The scope it has to affect the lives of children here is critical.  I endorse and support fully the appointment of Dr. Muldoon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200015#T00500","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1423743300,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  On my own behalf and on behalf of Labour Party Senators, I would like to add my voice to recommending Dr. Niall Muldoon for the position of Ombudsman for Children.  This is one of the most important positions in the country, as the role of the ombudsman is to safeguard the rights and welfare of children, at all times giving an objective ruling on complaints made by children or an adult on their behalf.  Dr. Muldoon, as Ombudsman for Children, must also accept and investigate complaints made with regard to the State and how decisions made by it affect children.  On that note, with Senator Leyden I acknowledge the role played by Fianna F&aacute;il in appointing the first Ombudsman for Children, a good move that has reaped benefits.<\/p>  <p>Dr. Niall Muldoon, with his vast wealth of expertise and knowledge will make an excellent ombudsman.  His role as director of services at the Children at Risk in Ireland Foundation, CARI, and subsequent provision of counselling and therapy to children and families who are victims of sexual abuse will benefit him in his new role.  He has over 20 years experience in child protection and played a key role in moving child protection forward.  I wish him the very best and know he will be up to the many challenges that lie ahead.<\/p> <p>I listened with interest to Senator Leyden's submission about the slapping of children and how we can manage without slapping them.  I quite agree with him and was thinking as he was speaking about whether I ever slapped my children.  I know of course I would probably have given a tap on the back of the hand or maybe on the backside.  My daughter always says that when she saw me going for the wooden spoon she would run, although I never used it on her.  I recall that when I would have an occasion to maybe chastise my son or reprimand him for something I would send him to his bedroom.  I found out that he used to absolutely love it because he loved nothing better than a good read in the quiet of his bedroom.

It seems to me that we have exactly the right man in Dr.  Muldoon.  The role is important given that we have such a young population that is also increasing at the fastest rate in the EU.  We need someone who can listen to children, and based on what we have heard today from various speakers, I think we have somebody.  In regard to Senator Leyden's memory of school, I think we all have memories good and bad, but to the best of my knowledge, my memory is certainly very good.  The Senator mentioned his first teacher.  My first teacher was Sr. Paula and I have nothing but great memories of her in the Holy Faith convent back so many years ago.<\/p>  <p>I have a vested interest here, because I have 16 grandchildren and am therefore looking forward to making sure that others who have children in Ireland will be assured of safety and security.  That is why I am interested in the reference from Senator van Turnhout to direct provision.  I would like to know if there have been any discussions recently by the ombudsman's office about widening its remit to investigate direct provision for asylum issues.  It seems to me that is one of the areas that has been left behind in the past.  <\/p>  <p>One of my other experiences has been to do with early childhood education.  In my supermarkets we had playhouses that looked after young children up to a certain age and what was interesting was that when they went to school, the teachers were able to identify the children that had been to the playhouse in Superquinn because they had learned.  Children were there from the age of two, three or four, before they went to school.  It seems to me that we can create benefit without necessarily relying entirely on the State to do it.  We have talked in this House before about the importance of early childhood education.  They are very formative years and are absolutely crucial to a child's development but I think we could do a lot more.  <\/p>  <p>One very interesting development is in Finland, where from 1 January a new preschool education law came into effect, which obliges parents to arrange education for their children before they start primary school.  That is a change from privilege to duty.  According to a Finnish Ministry of education survey, some of the children did not take part in preschool education because the parents wanted to keep them at home or because the distance to school was too long.  In many respects, Finland is leading the way in education.  Such a change may mean that no child is too far behind when they start school.  Finland recognises that these particular years are vital.  Irish schoolchildren start school earlier than their Finnish counterparts but it is interesting to ask whether preschool should be made mandatory.  Perhaps this is a question for the ombudsman to get involved with.  <\/p>  <p>There was a young man on the radio yesterday or the day before - not a young man, he is 34 now - who has been in jail for close to half his life.  He has had three long jail sentences and when he was asked what went wrong and how he ended up in that situation, he said he never learned, in those early years, how to read or write.  He discovered the vast majority of others in jail with him did not know how to read or write and were also illiterate.  Something we can do is ensure we have an education system that the quality of the education is important.  I gather that boys have a problem in reading skills.  We know that we have literacy and numeracy issues here and that is something I would like to see more attention paid to in later life.<\/p>  <p>One of the most interesting messages in terms of education focus is advocated by the World Bank.  It says that education should focus on basic cognitive skills like reading, writing and communication until children are 17 or 18, and that vocational training should wait.  We are well aware in this country of the massive amounts of children who left school to go into trades and did not have the skills to adapt when the economy changed.  We have to allow children to be flexible by giving them a strong base.<\/p>  <p>It is also interesting to note that early childhood marriage has been found to have a negative effect on literacy rates for young women.  Given the evidence, some experts argue that the minimum legal age of marriage should be raised to 21 years.  The current minimum age here is 18 but we know that a lot of exemptions are granted.  There was something on the radio this morning or yesterday about a Traveller family where a young man of 16 was getting married to a young woman of 17.  We should consider international evidence here, especially in light of incidents of children being forced into marriage.<\/p>  <p>On the wider issue, we could do more in terms of research and how we can better prepare children with very basic life skills such as basic financial management.  I do not really see this being taught at schools.  There is a definite link between poor financial management skills and dropout rates at third level education.  One bank in the UK has a programme delivered in schools that includes lessons on managing a private bank account and understanding information on pay slips for younger children. Children from age 16 receive classes on credit card use and insurance policy selection among other things.  I know 16 sounds a little bit late to be doing that but it is a reminder of what can be done.  There is a situation in Ireland where children are getting into financial difficulties because they are unaware of basic financial management skills.  It is an area where we can do a lot more in the future.<\/p>  <p>On children's rights, and this would very much be Senator van Turnhout's baby, there is a lot more that businesses can do.  In the past few years, UNICEF launched its children's rights and business principles initiative, which calls on businesses to carry out human rights due diligence, assessing how they may impact human rights and children's rights.  Big companies such as IKEA have signed up to the scheme, which gets businesses that are active globally to assess their impact on children's rights.  It is of course a moral issue but it can also be beneficial to companies.  They get a higher recognition when they do something good like this.  I understand schemes have been launched in a number of countries, including Britain, but I do not think the scheme has been launched here.  It would be beneficial to look at the scheme in terms of guiding Government policy on improving children's rights.  Businesses can do more in terms of children's rights and it could be possible for the ombudsman's office to raise awareness of the issue.  It is not a question of forcing things to be done - just raising awareness would be sufficient to do it.  I know from my experience in the supermarket business, people felt very good if the employer or service provider was acting in the community interest.  It is good for business and for the community as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200016#U00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1423743900,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators for their contributions to the debate on this motion.  I have much pleasure in recommending to the House that Dr. Niall Muldoon be appointed by the President to be the Ombudsman for Children.  Dr. Muldoon comes to this post with a wealth of experience, as has already been acknowledged.  He is currently the director of investigations at the Office of the Ombudsman for Children and has been in that role for two and a half years.  He is a registered clinical and counselling psychologist and was formerly the national clinical director of CARI.  He has worked in the area of child protection for nearly 20 years.  In Dr. Muldoon I am fully satisfied that we have a well-qualified, experienced and suitable nominee for appointment as our next Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015021200016#U00500","speaker":"952"}]
