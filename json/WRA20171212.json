In this regard, in the absence of a mid-life upgrade, naval vessels have a planned life expectancy of 20 to 25 years.  The three ships most recently decommissioned by the Naval Service were L&Eacute; Emer, commissioned in 1978, L&Eacute; Aoife, commissioned in 1979 and L&Eacute; Aisling, commissioned in 1980.  Extensive engineering surveys and analyses were carried out by the Naval Service on these vessels given their age and service history prior to decommissioning.<\/p>  <p>  There is a programme of continuous planned and preventative maintenance to ensure that all Naval Service vessels are kept in a seaworthy condition.  The Naval Service will only send ships to sea when they are satisfied the ships are in a seaworthy and safe condition.  The older ships are monitored through increased inspections and maintenance of hull strength, fatigue life and machinery condition based on actual service history.  All factors such as condition of the hull structure, condition and maintenance\/failure history of machinery, electrical and piping systems and operating profile and environments are evaluated to determine fatigue lives of critical structural components. <\/p>  <p>  The most significant investment of recent years by the Defence Organisation has been on the procurement of the new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels for the Naval Service.  This programme has seen the delivery of three new Naval Service vessels in the past 3 years.  The L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett was commissioned in May 2014, L&Eacute; James Joyce was commissioned in September 2015 and L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats was commissioned into service in October 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In June 2016, a contract for an additional sister ship was placed with Babcock International, a British company, bringing investment in the new ships programme to some &euro;250 million since 2010. The fourth ship, to be named L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw is scheduled for delivery in mid-2018. <\/p>  <p>  The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with an ongoing maintenance regime for all vessels within the fleet, and the continuous process of refurbishment, refit and repair, will ensure that the operational capabilities of the Naval Service, as the State&rsquo;s principal seagoing agency, are maintained to the greatest extent. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to acquisitions, it is normal practice in a ship&rsquo;s life to carry out a mid-life refurbishment programme so as to extend the useful life of a ship to thirty or more years.  In this regard, the Defence Organisation has commenced planning for a mid-life refurbishment programme for L&Eacute; Roisin and L&Eacute; Niamh.  This structured mid-life refurbishment programme will future proof the vessels, allow for preventative maintenance and address obsolescence of equipment through capitalising on advancements in technology, thus ensuring reliability of the vessels for the next 15 years. <\/p>  <p>  As it stands three ships in the current flotilla are over 30 years old (L&Eacute; Eithne, L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Orla).  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) which will be enabled for helicopter operations and will also have a freight carrying capacity.  Planning has commenced on this project and it is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV.  This, of course, is subject to the availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope. The cost of the MRV will only be known once the tender competition is concluded. <\/p>  <p>  Future Naval Service capabilities are being planned as part of the White Paper project planning process which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200073#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Retirements","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200073#WRA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[52966\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200073#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his views on the fact that 335 members of the Defence Forces have left voluntarily to date in 2017; if he has satisfied himself that the pay and conditions of the Defence Forces is acceptable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a relatively high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel.

The Strategy also identifies key security challenges facing the European Union within its neighbourhood and beyond, and commits to a global order based on international law with the United Nations at its centre.  Within the provisions of the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the strategy commits the Union to take greater responsibility for its own security and to enhance its capacity to contribute to international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.<\/p>  <p>  Following its publication, a comprehensive approach to implementation, including in the area of security and defence, is now being progressed.  As part of that implementation process, in June 2017, the European Council agreed to launch an inclusive and ambitious PESCO, as provided for in the Treaty on European Union, and to draw up a common list of criteria and binding commitments, within three months. <\/p>  <p>  Over the past several months, there has been significant engagement by all member States in the development of PESCO as is now set out in the PESCO Notification.  This included extensive discussions at official level through meetings of the Political-Military Group, the Political and Security Committee, and Defence Policy Directors and at Ministerial level at meetings of Defence and Foreign Affairs Ministers. Ireland participated fully in these discussions, shaping the development of PESCO and the provisions in the Notification in a manner which ensured that PESCO was both inclusive and ambitious, fully recognising the differing defence policies of the member States as provided for in the treaties and their protocols. <\/p>  <p>  The final version of the PESCO 'Notification' was agreed by EU Member States on 13 November, 2017.  Following that agreement a Memorandum for Government was prepared.

In the Air Corps the loss of experienced personnel led to the suspension of the standby roster for out-of-hours and weekend contingencies.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that during 2017 to end November, the Air Corps has carried out 28 Inter-Hospital Air Ambulance transfers to the UK at the request of the HSE, three of which were priority one transfers relating to children requiring urgent organ transplants. <\/p>  <p>  In the Air Corps, there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts such as Pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and certain Technicians.  These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-state sector job opportunities.  The retention of such specialists has proved challenging for many military forces internationally.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that further consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission of recruitment and retention issues is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, is a welcome development.   <\/p>  <p>  At Defence Organisation level, a Working Group comprised of Civil and Military personnel was established to look at ways of addressing the issue of how to retain sufficiently experienced Pilot Officers within the Air Corps.  The Working Group&rsquo;s report contained a number of recommendations ranging from increasing recruitment levels to examining the current terms and conditions of pilots.  Work on the implementation of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations is currently ongoing by both Civil and Military staff of the Defence Organisation.  In addition, and as part of a wider initiative, the possibility of recruiting former personnel who have left the Defence Forces is also being examined. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Two classes of Apprentice Military Aircraft Technicians began training during 2017.  Ten cadet pilots began their training in October with other cadet classes already in training.

The importance of inclusivity and the need for respecting the differing security and defence policies of the member States, as reflected in the treaties and the treaty protocols, was also discussed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200074#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200074#WRB03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Data","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200074#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[52861\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200074#WRB03000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the value of trade in goods between Ireland and Britain in 2016; and the estimated amount for 2017.","asker":"1327","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[52862\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200074#WRB03100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the value of trade in services between Ireland and Britain in 2016; and the estimated amount for 2017.","asker":"1327","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.<\/p><p>The data requested by the Deputy is set out in the table.<\/p><p>It should be noted that data on the value of trade in goods and services are not available for the full year for 2017.

In the Council, the Government works with the Northern Ireland Executive to advance areas of practical co-operation which are to our mutual benefit, and the Council oversees co-operation in the agreed twelve Areas or Sectors.<\/p>  <p>  In six of these Sectors, co-operation is taken forward by means of the North South Implementation Bodies:  Waterways Ireland, Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, Special EU Programmes Body, North\/South Language Body, and the Loughs Agency, all of which operate on an all-island basis.<\/p>  <p>  In the other six &ldquo;Areas of Co-operation&rdquo; - agriculture; education; environment; health; tourism (including Tourism Ireland Ltd.) and transport - common policies and approaches are agreed in the North South Ministerial Council but implemented separately in each jurisdiction.  Outside of the NSMC structure, good co-operation also takes place in other areas including energy. <\/p>  <p>  With the continuing absence of a functioning Executive, the North South Ministerial Council cannot operate and bring together the Government and the Executive to oversee ongoing North\/South work and further develop co-operation, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  This is a most serious absence, and particularly so at a time when the Council should be continuing the work it commenced last year to deal with the challenges of the UK exit from the EU.  Common Principles were agreed at the Plenary meeting of the NSMC in November 2016, to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive to deal with the challenges that are raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit from the European Union. We should be working together on this through the North South Ministerial Council.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the UK exit, a North South mapping exercise was undertaken during October and November 2017 between the EU Article 50 Taskforce, with the support of Irish officials, and the UK to map out areas of co-operation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland. It highlighted just how broad-ranging and varied that co-operation is.  The exercise demonstrated the extensive range of co-operation that happens, under the formal auspices of the North South Ministerial Council, including through the work of the six Implementation Bodies; between Government Departments in non-NSMC areas; and between agencies, regulators and other Government bodies.  The co-operation is interconnected, mutually supporting and complementary.<\/p>  <p>  North South co-operation brings very tangible benefits to the daily lives of people and, in particular, to those living in the border regions where it contributes to improving economic opportunity and development.

Ireland fully supports this process and the work of UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura.<\/p>  <p>  The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.  The EU Syria Peace Process Support Initiative aims to facilitate the peace process, build the capacity of opposition parties and contribute to dialogue with civil society in support of the efforts of the UN Special Envoy for Syria.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU also provide support, including financial support, to a broad range of mechanisms to ensure legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria as part of a sustainable peaceful resolution to the conflict. <\/p>  <p>  Through our annual contributions to the EU institutions Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the crisis, from which &euro;445 million was contributed in 2016 alone.  The EU and its Member States have together mobilised more than &euro;9.4 billion for humanitarian and resilience assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort.  At the Brussels conference in April 2017 which was co-hosted by the EU, a further &euro;3.7 billion for 2017 was pledged by the EU and its Member States, representing nearly 67% of the pledges.  The EU will host another donors&rsquo; conference for Syria in 2018.  Since 2012 Ireland has contributed over &euro;90 million to the international humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million this year. This is our largest contribution to a single crisis in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  Syria is not currently on the agenda for this week&rsquo;s European Council, however at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels yesterday, EU Foreign Ministers discussed the regional situation in the Middle East, including of course the urgent need for progress towards peace in Syria. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200075#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200075#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":139,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[53227\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200075#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the recent declaration by President Trump of the United States on Jerusalem being the capital of Israel will be discussed at the December 2017 European Council meeting; and his plans to ensure that Ireland's objections to this declaration will be made known.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[52824\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200075#WRC04300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the reports that the American Government may move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (details supplied); his views on the plans to move the embassy to Jerusalem; and if he has raised concerns regarding this development with the United States Government.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":141,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[53209\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200075#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the impact of President Trump's decision to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; the impact he views this will have on the peace process; the actions the Government and the European Union will take in view of this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":142,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 108 and 115 together.<\/p>  <p>  On 6 December I issued a public statement on the announcement by the US Government about Jerusalem, which was as follows:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;Jerusalem is one of the permanent status issues which is to be settled in a final peace agreement in the Middle East. <\/p>  <p>  It has been the united position of the international community for decades, as set out in UN Security Council Resolutions, that a resolution of the Middle East conflict will include agreement for Jerusalem to be the capital of both Israel and the future state of Palestine.

However, this is ultimately a decision for the UK and, as of now, the UK government&rsquo;s stated position is that they will leave the Single Market and Customs when leaving the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  At the request of the EU and UK Coordinators for the High Level Dialogue on Ireland\/Northern Ireland, officials carried out detailed work over October and November to map out areas of co-operation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies.  The exercise underlined the importance of maintaining full alignment with the rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union necessary to continue and develop meaningful North South co-operation.  Through the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, North South co-operation has made a hugely important contribution to the improvement of people's lives on this island.  We want to ensure that this co-operation can continue in a meaningful way.<\/p>  <p>  In the joint EU-UK report on progress issued last Friday, the UK asserts its commitment to protecting North South co-operation and to avoiding a hard border.  The agreement not only provides a guarantee that there will be no hard border in any circumstances, it spells out for the first time how this will be achieved.  In the event that it is not possible to resolve the border issue as part of a wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which has always been the Irish Government&rsquo;s preference, or through specific solutions, paragraph 49 of the report states out that, &ldquo;in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement.&rdquo; It has also been agreed that any agreements put in place will be accompanied by effective mechanisms to ensure implementation and oversight.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU and the UK agreed that, in the next phase of the negotiations, work will continue on the detailed arrangements required to give effect to the principles and commitments that have been made.

In support of this, and particularly in view of the challenges presented by the UK exit from the EU, we clearly need to assist our SMEs in whatever ways we can.  This in turn can safeguard jobs, and encourage cross-border investments. InterTrade Ireland, for which the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has responsibility in this jurisdiction, is doing excellent work in this area.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that it is more mutually beneficial to work together rather than separately, and the development of an all-island economy is in everyone&rsquo;s interests.<\/p>  <p>  An all-island approach has already proved very successful in the Tourism sector, where Tourism Ireland has successfully marketed the island throughout the world.

Common Principles were agreed at the Plenary meeting of the NSMC in November 2016, to coordinate engagement by the Government and the Executive to deal with the challenges that are raised on an all-island basis by the UK exit from the European Union. We should be working together on this through the North South Ministerial Council.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government is continuing to work with the British Government, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, to support the effective operation of all of its institutions, including the NSMC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200075#WRC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200075#WRC05400"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[52817\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200075#WRC05500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the recent meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council; his further views on the announcement of a new political and military alliance between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>As I have stated previously in this House and elsewhere, the situation between Qatar and its neighbours is a matter of concern.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports regional cooperation and dialogue, and believes that the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) makes a contribution to the stability of the wider Arab region.

Over recent weeks there has been a steady increase in recorded violations of the most recent truce with both sides continuing to ignore calls to pull back their heavy weapons from the contact line. Daily shelling has resulted in significant damage to critical civilian infrastructure facilities, in particular water and power supplies, as wells as schools and hospitals.  With no let-up in the fighting, little progress has been made this year on implementing the Minsk peace agreements.<\/p>  <p>  The EU remains fully behind efforts to secure implementation of the Minsk peace agreements within the framework of the OSCE Trilateral Contact Group (OSCE, Russia and Ukraine) and the Normandy Format (France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine).  The Trilateral Contact Group continues to work on confidence building measures, including exchange of prisoners and disengagement from the contact line.<\/p>  <p>  In September, Russia tabled a UN Security Council resolution for the deployment of UN peacekeepers to protect the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM).  While this is a welcome development it remains to be seen if significant concerns over elements of the proposal, including Russia&lsquo;s insistence on a role for the separatists in the practicalities of any UN deployment, can be overcome.   <\/p>  <p>  The EU economic sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 for its role in destabilising Ukraine remain in place.

It is important to acknowledge the significant improvement that has taken place over the last two years.

The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement entered into force on 1 September, enabling the EU to further strengthen its cooperation with Ukraine and to deepen the country&rsquo;s political association and economic integration with the Union.

This Resolution establishes a group of international experts, who will establish the facts in relation to violations of human rights and humanitarian law on the ground.  This group will report back to the Human Rights Council, as an important step towards accountability in Yemen.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to press for a negotiated settlement to the conflict in Yemen, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, and improved humanitarian access to those in need.  We fully support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed to work towards a peace agreement.  At the Foreign Affairs Council on 11 December, I urged stronger action by the EU in relation to the barriers to humanitarian access in Yemen.  I will continue to raise my concerns about the situation in Yemen with the Saudi authorities, as well as with other parties, and at EU and international levels, whenever opportunities arise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200076#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Negotiations","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200076#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[52908\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200076#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the position regarding maintaining full alignment; and the way in which he and his officials are of the view this will be applied in any future EU-UK deal.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>The issue of regulatory alignment arises both in regard to the wider EU-UK relationship, and in the particular circumstances of Ireland.<\/p><p>It is clear that, once the UK exits the EU, the question will arise as to how far the UK, which will not be bound by EU law once it departs and which will not be part of the EU decision making process, will wish over time to exercise its own right to legislate and regulate in ways which could mean divergence between UK and EU regulations.  The smoothest possible trading relationship will therefore require mechanisms to monitor and, if possible, resolve such regulatory divergence.<\/p><p>The second phase of the Article 50 negotiations will enable discussions to get underway between the EU and the UK on these important issues.

The Good Friday Agreement provides for important institutional cooperation on an east-West basis including through the British Irish Council (BIC). <\/p>  <p>  Other channels of contact and cooperation have developed over the years as the relationship between these islands has grown closer.  For example, in 2012, a process was established involving summits between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister, supported by a Joint Work Programme managed at official level by the heads of all government departments in both London and Dublin.  In addition, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA) brings together elected representatives from the Oireachtas, Westminster, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Scottish and Welsh devolved assemblies.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there have been a number of successful high-level visits in recent years that have had a very positive impact on our relationship, notably the state visit by Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland in 2011 and the reciprocal state visit by President Higgins to the UK in 2014.  Most recently, President Higgins travelled to Dumfries House in Scotland at the invitation of the Prince of Wales, following the visit of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall to Ireland earlier this year, their third visit in as many years. <\/p>  <p>  I recently welcomed Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to Dublin, providing an opportunity to discuss the importance of the bilateral relationship between the UK and Ireland and how this can be maintained and strengthened after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.

The UK has always been one of our most important bilateral relationships.  It is up to us to continue to strengthen this relationship and to find areas for sustained cooperation.

By contrast, it is generally acknowledged that any comprehensive peace between Israel and the Arab states will involve the return of the Golan area to Syria.

Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold (when aggregated since 5 December 1991) CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold.<\/p><p>There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer. <\/p><p><b>Group A<\/b>: tax free threshold &euro;310,000 &ndash; applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.

The main conditions attaching to this exemption are that the person who inherits the dwelling house must have lived there for a minimum of three years prior to the inheritance and must not have had an interest in any other dwelling-house.  The dwelling house passing by inheritance must also be the sole or main residence of the disponer.  In addition, with the exception of persons who are aged 65 years or over at the date of the inheritance, he or she must continue to live in that dwelling-house, as his or her only or main residence, for a period of six years commencing on the date of the inheritance. This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be liable to inheritance tax when it is the subject of an inheritance.<\/p><p>Where a couple is cohabiting, rather than married or in a civil partnership, each partner is treated for the purposes of tax as a separate and unconnected individual.  Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.  From a practical perspective a CAT regime for cohabitants which would be the same as for married persons or civil partners would be difficult to administer and is likely to be intrusive.  It would be time consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were cohabitating or when cohabitation started and ceased.  <\/p><p>As regards the treatment of individuals with no children, gifts or inheritances from them are subject to either category B or C thresholds irrespective of their individual status.  There would be a significant Exchequer cost with the extension of the Category A threshold to individuals with no children and it would be likely to give rise to tax planning opportunities. <\/p><p>Finally, I would say that the current CAT structure is a long standing feature of the tax system which has been agreed by the Oireachtas.

","asker":"1304","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":317,"content":"<p>The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.  This has been used to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers including a 15-22% increase in pay which I negotiated last year.  The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the sale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and apprenticeships. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this, newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward Circular which reduced the qualifying period from a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs.  In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers included a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before. <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;130 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. <\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases\u00a0that\u00a0have been negotiated would mean I would have had less money available to hire\u00a0over 1,000 extra SNAs in 2018, and over 1,000 extra teachers in 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded Public Service Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.  An initial meeting on new entrant pay under this process took place on 12 October 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200078#WRF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200078#WRF05200"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[52767\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200078#WRF05300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to review the English curriculum in the primary level education cycle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This is known as Risk Assessment.  The aim of Risk Assessment is to reduce the risk of injury and illness associated with work.

Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. <\/p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner.

This is a substantial allocation of hours for a school of this size.<\/p>  <p>  Whereas the profiled allocation had indicated a need of\u00a045 hours for this school, based on its school profile and size, and relative to the profiled needs of all other schools, the school was allocated\u00a046.03 hours, which was equivalent to the allocation the school received in 2016\/17.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis,\u00a0as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations.<\/p>  <p>  Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, a\u00a0number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.<\/p>  <p>  In March of this year, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for schools.<\/p>  <p>  Schools were advised that this appeal would consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 0013 and 0014 2017.  An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation.<\/p>  <p>  Schools who wished to submit an appeal on this basis were asked to do so by March 31 2017.  These appeals have been processed and this appeal process has now concluded.  The school mentioned did submit and appeal and were informed of the outcome in August 2017.<\/p>  <p>  A second process has been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17\/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12\/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).<\/p>  <p>  Schools who qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualified for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.<\/p>  <p>  Schools were also advised\u00a0that it acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status.<\/p>  <p>  These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has now published details of how schools can seek a review of their allocations, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  The school referred to by the Deputy in this question\u00a0has submitted a request for a\u00a0review under this process and the NCSE will be in\u00a0contact\u00a0with\u00a0the school\u00a0regarding this\u00a0request in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200080#WRH04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":434,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200080#WRH05000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rights of Way Registration","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200080#WRH04900"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[52660\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200080#WRH05000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the process for registering a right of way; the changes to the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that there are two systems of registration in Ireland managed and controlled by the Property Registration Authority (PRA).<\/p><p>Where the property affected by the right of way is unregistered land, the process for registering a deed of Grant of Right of Way is set out in the PRA&rsquo;s \u00a0Practice Direction &ldquo;Registry of Deeds Procedures&rdquo; available on the PRA website\u00a0<i><i>www.prai.ie<\/i><\/i>.<\/p><p>Where the property affected by the right of way is registered land (i.e. registered in the Land Registry) the process for registering a deed of Grant of Right of Way in the Land Registry is set out in the PRA&rsquo;s Practice Direction &ldquo;Burdens &ndash; Registration of Burdens&rdquo; and if an application is made to have the right of way registered as appurtenant to the dominant tenement in the PRA&rsquo;s Practice Direction &ldquo;Appurtenant Rights&rdquo; available on the PRA website <i><i>www.prai.ie<\/i><\/i>.<\/p><p>The reference in the Deputy's Question to &ldquo;changes to the process&rdquo; may refer to rights of way acquired by prescription.

To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme. <\/p><p>I am informed that the breakdown of the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; this year is as set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Newly attested Garda assigned in 2017<\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Division<\/td><td>2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

The 2018 Budget has provided an allocation of &euro;3 million for the establishment of the Decision Support Service.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am continuing to take a wide range of practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.

We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Co. Cork Divisions.  <\/p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<b><\/b><\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of personnel including\u00a0Reserves and civilians assigned to the\u00a0Co.

The next meeting is planned for Wednesday 13 December.  The meetings provide an opportunity to review progress and to drive forward implementation of the Strategy.<\/p><p>To date, work has begun on approximately 100 of the actions in the Strategy.  The Steering Group will continue to monitor progress on these Actions and to focus on actions where progress has not yet commenced.  It is a priority for me that\u00a0the\u00a0momentum achieved\u00a0to date is maintained.\u00a0<\/p><p>The following specific Actions which are included in the Strategy:<\/p><p>98.  The Department of Justice and Equality will support the development of community leadership in gender equality with men and women from the Traveller and Roma communities with a view to developing gender equality.<\/p><p>112.\u00a0\u00a0Members of the Traveller and Roma communities will be supported in the reporting of racist crimes.<\/p><p>117.\u00a0\u00a0The Department of Justice and Equality will support the development and delivery by Traveller and Roma organisations of initiatives aimed at challenging homophobia and transphobia within the Traveller and Roma communities including support for Traveller and Roma families who have children\/partners coming out.<\/p><p>With regard to Action 98, my Department has provided increased funding of &euro;55,000 to the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum in 2017 to assist the organisation in promoting the gender equality actions contained in the NTRIS with a view to further developing Gender Equality in the Traveller and Roma communities.  Further discussions will take place during 2018 between this Department and the national Traveller and Roma-focussed NGOs with a view to the promotion of the gender equality actions contained in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021. <\/p><p>On Action 112, I understand that the\u00a0former Garda Racial Intercultural and Diversity Office has recently been subsumed into the Garda Bureau of Community, Diversity and Integration. It\u00a0has responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and advising on all aspects of policing Ireland's diverse communities.  The GBCDI\u00a0monitors the reporting and recording of hate and racist crime on a continual basis. <\/p><p>Garda Ethnic Liaison Officers (ELOs) are appointed to work with minority communities at local level throughout the country.  These officers combined with the GBCDI play a fundamental role in liaising with minority groups and work in partnership to encourage tolerance, respect and understanding within communities in the pursuit of preventing the commission of hate and racist crime. GBCDI and ELOs provide advice and assistance to victims of hate or racist crime where required or deemed necessary.<\/p><p>Existing Irish law is in compliance with the EU Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia as regards online hate speech.  This is, however,\u00a0a complex area to legislate for and any further proposals for research in this area would have to take account of the review carried out under the auspices of the National Action Plan against racism\u00a0in recent years and would have to take cognisance of best\u00a0practice in the Cybercrime area.<\/p><p>Finally, for Action 117, my Department will work with Traveller and Roma NGOs in 2018 with a view to providing the support necessary for the delivery of the initiatives concerned, as described in this Action. In this regard, my Department will commence work in the New Year on the drafting of a new National LGBT Strategy, which will also contain recommendations in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200081#WRJ05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200081#WRJ05300"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[52998\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200081#WRJ05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be considered for Irish citizenship; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":499,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that there is no record of an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the persons referred to by the Deputy.

Such amendment would, in equity, have to cover all public servants who resigned prior to the effective date applicable to their schemes.\u00a0\u00a0That Department has further stated that changing the various schemes to change the cut-off date is not a practicable proposition.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK01800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Good Friday Agreement","counter":522,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":523,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[52686\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the trade matters contained within the Good Friday Agreement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":524,"content":"<p>The Good Friday Agreement of 1998\u00a0provided for the establishment of several implementation bodies, including a 'Trade and Business Body'.\u00a0 The British Irish Agreement Act 1999 and the equivalent UK legislation provided the statutory basis for\u00a0the establishment of this body, known as\u00a0InterTrade Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Since its establishment,\u00a0InterTrade Ireland -\u00a0which is co-funded by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department for the Economy -\u00a0has\u00a0implemented a range of initiatives and programmes to help businesses\u00a0develop and enhance\u00a0cross-border trade. \u00a0The Body has also notably been active, since the EU-UK referendum in June 2016, in assisting\u00a0companies in both jurisdictions prepare for the commercial\u00a0challenges that Brexit may present. \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Union Recognition","counter":525,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK02000"},{"type":"question","counter":526,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[53235\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will raise with a company (details supplied) which is engaged by the HSE on State contracts the reason it does not recognise a union which represents its staff in view of the fact that it recognises a union in Northern Ireland; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to attention but should\u00a0point out\u00a0that under Irish law there is no requirement\u00a0for an employer to recognise trade unions\u00a0for the purpose of\u00a0collective bargaining. <\/p>  <p>  Article 40 of the Irish Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form associations and unions.

Some investments which result in job creation may not be grant aided and some well-established firms may no longer be receiving grant payments.<table><tr><th>County<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow<\/td><td>&euro;5,093,152<\/td><td>&euro;72,000<\/td><td>&euro;2,027,393<\/td><td>&euro;1,080,631<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;120,622<\/td><td>&euro;418,271<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;3,172,202<\/td><td>&euro;4,463,951<\/td><td>&euro;3,023,557<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>&euro;12,380,130<\/td><td>&euro;18,353,580<\/td><td>&euro;13,260,876<\/td><td>&euro;13,220,973<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal<\/td><td>&euro;3,071,490<\/td><td>&euro;1,889,800<\/td><td>&euro;1,697,150<\/td><td>&euro;685,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>&euro;24,803,491<\/td><td>&euro;19,952,938<\/td><td>&euro;19,826,741<\/td><td>&euro;20,136,706<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>&euro;17,277,141<\/td><td>&euro;8,422,227<\/td><td>&euro;18,357,383<\/td><td>&euro;13,611,022<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry<\/td><td>&euro;584,145<\/td><td>&euro;16,800<\/td><td>&euro;3,220,609<\/td><td>&euro;1,024,766<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare<\/td><td>&euro;4,690,248<\/td><td>&euro;728,457<\/td><td>&euro;5,798,570<\/td><td>&euro;3,573,544<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;350,000<\/td><td>&euro;440,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;25,000<\/td><td>&euro;75,000<\/td><td>&euro;5,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>&euro;4,434,483<\/td><td>&euro;15,374,032<\/td><td>&euro;10,596,531<\/td><td>&euro;13,589,484<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;397,750<\/td><td>&euro;169,542<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>&euro;2,935,800<\/td><td>&euro;3,672,307<\/td><td>&euro;993,000<\/td><td>&euro;3,031,765<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo<\/td><td>&euro;4,180,577<\/td><td>&euro;6,376,253<\/td><td>&euro;2,406,422<\/td><td>&euro;1,498,389<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath<\/td><td>&euro;1,540,920<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;300,000<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;58,022<\/td><td>&euro;200,000<\/td><td>&euro;200,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly<\/td><td>&euro;150,042<\/td><td>&euro;324,662<\/td><td>&euro;120,000<\/td><td>&euro;355,540<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon<\/td><td>&euro;110,000<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;733,000<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>&euro;796,831<\/td><td>&euro;750,892<\/td><td>&euro;4,229,218<\/td><td>&euro;922,814<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>&euro;2,729,055<\/td><td>&euro;3,654,309<\/td><td>&euro;2,939,811<\/td><td>&euro;2,580,100<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>&euro;1,938,976<\/td><td>&euro;1,867,329<\/td><td>&euro;1,341,864<\/td><td>&euro;10,914,081<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath<\/td><td>&euro;272,624<\/td><td>&euro;1,948,923<\/td><td>&euro;2,513,508<\/td><td>&euro;1,768,687<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>&euro;934,569<\/td><td>&euro;783,794<\/td><td>&euro;1,534,136<\/td><td>&euro;568,307<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>&euro;27,623<\/td><td>&euro;43,738<\/td><td>&euro;234,048<\/td><td>&euro;159,372<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>&euro;87,951,297<\/td><td>&euro;87,487,265<\/td><td>&euro;97,737,583<\/td><td>&euro;92,978,051<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement Reports","counter":544,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK03700"},{"type":"question","counter":545,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[53207\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK03800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 124 of 21 November 2017, the specific powers she lacks or the legal obstacle preventing the publishing of the report received from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in regard to an investigation (details supplied);

A further round of high-level talks on the EU-Mercosur FTA took place from 29 November to 8 December 2017.  The European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of the EU Member States in Trade negotiations.  <\/p>  <p>  An EU-Mercosur FTA would be the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date, and would be four times the size of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, which was recently concluded.  An EU-Mercosur trade agreement aims to eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.  Irish exporters are currently subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions, when exporting to Mercosur, while imports from Mercosur, particularly in agriculture, are currently subject to high tariffs.  The proposed FTA should make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase demand for Irish products.   <\/p>  <p>  EU law requires all relevant EU policies, including trade policy, to promote sustainable development.  Sustainable development has three pillars: economic, environmental and social.  The EU Mercosur FTA has a defined section on sustainable development which includes climate change.  A Sustainability Impact Assessment being carried out on the EU Mercosur FTA will also have a designated section on climate change as part of its environmental analysis.  <\/p>  <p>  The precautionary principle is enshrined in the EU treaties and all EU trade agreements must respect those treaties.  The EU ensures that all its trade agreements fully respect the right to regulate on the basis of the precautionary principle.  Trade agreements must also uphold existing EU food safety regulations and other 'secondary legislation' which includes the precautionary principle. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, Ireland remains fully committed to this negotiation, especially in view of the important economic and political gains expected for both sides from a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced EU-Mercosur Association Agreement that will be good for a range of Irish exporting companies and jobs.  However, we also have to be mindful of the cumulative impact of EU FTAs on specific sectors, such as agriculture, and the challenges which they face if having to respond to competition on multiple fronts in a comparatively short space of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":558,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK05200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Provision","counter":557,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK05100"},{"type":"question","counter":558,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[52869\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when funding that an organisation (details supplied) has been requesting for the past five years to source new buildings and upgrade current buildings will be released; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":559,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible. In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level. <\/p>  <p>  However when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow.  Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources.  This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services. Service providers continue to keep the matter of transport under review. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to establishing a high level cross divisional working group to rationalise the provision of transport and to maximise equitable access and efficiencies. The HSE also intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities.  The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.  The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities. <\/p>  <p>  As the remainder of the Deputy's relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Correspondence","counter":563,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK05700"},{"type":"question","counter":564,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[53200\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK05800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received correspondence from a person (details supplied); if so, if his Department or an agency under the remit of his Department is taking action on foot of this correspondence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[53153\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200082#WRK05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received correspondence from a person (details supplied); if he or an agency under the remit of his Department is taking action on foot of this correspondence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":566,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 and 360 together.<\/p><p>I, my Department, and an agency under the remit of my Department have received correspondence from the person concerned and have been copied in on related correspondence submitted to other Departments and agencies.

However, it is understood that Duogynon was available in Ireland up to the 1970s, with distribution discontinued in 1978.<\/p><p>Although never authorised for use in Ireland, the 1975 annual report of the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB, a predecessor of the HPRA) outlined the consideration given by the NDAB to the use of hormonal testing for pregnancy.  This report related to hormonal pregnancy testing preparations in general, and did not mention any specific product.  In April 1975, the NDAB issued a warning letter to practitioners regarding the use of hormonal pregnancy testing preparations.  This letter reminded practitioners that these preparations had not been assessed by the NDAB, and that their use as a means of pregnancy testing had not been accepted by the NDAB. The letter also highlighted that these preparations should be avoided, as a firm statement of safety could not be given and other, more efficient methods of pregnancy testing were available. <\/p><p>While not an authorised medicinal product in Ireland, five reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with use of Duogynon were received by the NDAB between 1976 and 1980, describing suspected congenital abnormalities.  There is very limited information available in relation to these reports. <\/p><p>The HPRA has no information regarding the numbers of women in Ireland who may have used Duogynon for diagnosis of their pregnancies in the 1970s.<\/p><p>In the UK, where HPTs were licensed (and where they were used from the early 1950s to 1978), an Expert Working Group of the UK&rsquo;s Commission on Human Medicines recently completed a review of this issue and published a report on the use of hormone pregnancy tests (HPTs) and adverse effects relating to pregnancy, including possible birth defects.  This report concluded that following extensive and rigorous review, based on the totality of the available data, that the scientific evidence does not support a causal association between the use of HPTs such as Primodos and birth defects or miscarriage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200083#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services Provision","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200083#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[52615\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200083#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the provision of overnight respite for children with special needs in counties Carlow and Kilkenny through the purchase of suitable property (details supplied); the position regarding the provision of interim alternative respite solutions for children with special needs in counties Carlow and Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1368","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.<\/p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination  against small businesses and family farms.  It is important to remember that the NHSS is largely underpinned by primary legislation  and changes to the NHSS will require legislative implementation.<\/p>  <p>  On this basis, I have requested legal advice from the office of the Attorney General regarding potential changes to the legislation that will address this matter.  My department has also been cognisant of this matter in the context of this years estimates process.  I have recently met with representatives from the I.F.A and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association to discuss various strategies that may assist with addressing their members concerns and have apprised them of the current progress.  I remain hopeful to be in receipt of this legal advice before year end and I am committed to this review of the position with regard to family farms and small businesses for the purposes of the financial assessment of the scheme.  Any proposed changes will require primary legislation and I hope to be in a position to progress this in early 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200084#WRM03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200084#WRM03300"},{"type":"question","counter":657,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[52749\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200084#WRM03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the hyperbaric oxygen therapy centre at University Hospital Galway; the location, opening times and designated person in charge thereof; the referral process of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":658,"content":"<p>In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200084#WRM03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Coverage","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200084#WRM03600"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[52750\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200084#WRM03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeframe for theFreeStyle Libre to be available on the HSE's long-term illness scheme for persons with diabetes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200084#WRM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200084#WRM03900"},{"type":"question","counter":663,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[52756\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200084#WRM04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if an appointment for a person (details supplied) will be scheduled at the paediatric unit in University Hospital Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":664,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The action undertaken this year included additional activity within our paediatric hospitals, which was facilitated by the staff recruitment campaigns this year, and outsourcing initiatives to hospitals at home and overseas.  For the first time in a number of years, the waiting list for scoliosis-related surgery is reducing.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is committed  to supporting the HSE to continue to bring down the waiting times and improve access to scoliosis services, and progress continues on reducing numbers waiting and waiting times in a planned, safe and sustainable manner.  The four-month target set by the HSE for long waiters this year has driven the progress that has been made and the Director General of the HSE has indicated that the 4 month target will be maintained for 2018 measured from when the person is determined as needing surgery.  A Paediatric Scoliosis Services Co-Design Group is in place, which includes clinicians, hospital staff and representatives from the scoliosis advocacy groups, to design a comprehensive contemporary and patient-centred approach to the delivery of scoliosis services.  I had a fruitful meeting with this group recently to discuss their work to date.  The work of the Co-Design Group will form the basis for developing scoliosis services into 2018 and beyond.  The Group is expected to develop criteria for surgery based on clinical grounds and national and international best practice to ensure that children\/young adolescents have surgery when clinically indicated for their individual case and within a time period that does not cause clinical deterioration of their condition, as opposed to within an administrative fixed timeline or target.<\/p>  <p>  Further investment in paediatric orthopaedic services next year is being considered in the context of the 2018 National Service Plan discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200085#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists Data","counter":689,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200085#WRN00700"},{"type":"question","counter":690,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[52809\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200085#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the yearly data on waiting times for when psychiatric patients presented at accident and emergency departments and when they are either admitted for treatment or discharged in each of the years 2010 to 2016 and to date in 2017, by hospital, in tabular form;

The HSE does not require approval or consent from the Minister or Government when making a reimbursement decision.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). <\/p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible and within the 180 days.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an ongoing basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.<\/p>  <p>  The price that some companies are seeking to charge means that the innovative products may never reach the patients as health systems cannot afford the price.

For example, in 2015 price reductions were negotiated for almost two thirds of medicines that underwent a full health technology assessment.<\/p>  <p>  When the decision is taken not to reimburse a medicine, there is an extension in this timeline . This is due to the requirement of the HSE to issue a &ldquo;notice of proposal&rdquo;, and to allow 28 days for manufacturers to make representations to reconsider their decision.

The 2013 Act specifies the criteria to be applied in making decisions on the reimbursement of medicines. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of orphan medicines, with very small patient populations,  and the price barriers for health systems in supplying them to patients, is world-wide.  Orphan product manufacturers have exclusive patents and are monopoly suppliers.  They can, and frequently do, seek very high prices for these products.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE seeks, where possible, to give patients early access to new treatments.  However, it must work within the budget provided by the Oireachtas. In the statutory reimbursement process, supported by the 2016 Framework Agreement with industry, the HSE makes decisions on objective scientific and economic grounds.  Criteria which must be considered include the population&rsquo;s health needs, the product&rsquo;s cost and clinical effectiveness, opportunity costs, the budget impact and available resources. <\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions are supported by health technology assessments (HTAs), which systematically assess whether a drug is a cost-effective health intervention.  Currently, most new medicines, including orphan products, undergo HTAs.  However, not all applications have sufficient information for assessment and in such cases this must be sought.  Also, as HTAs frequently cannot demonstrate value for money for items at the price sought by the company, lengthy price negotiations between the HSE and the manufacturer may be needed.  These factors contribute significantly to the length of the reimbursement decision making process.<\/p>  <p>  A new Committee called the &ldquo;Rare Diseases Medicinal Products\/Technology Review Committee&rdquo; was established in June 2017 by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  The terms of reference for the Committee have been finalised and  the responsibilities of the Committee include the review of proposals for funding of new products for rare diseases or expanded indications for existing products for rare diseases.  The composition of the Committee will ensure that the voice of patients, patient groups and clinical experts will be available to the HSE when considering reimbursement of drugs for rare diseases.<\/p>  <p>  The Committee will also contribute to the development of clinical guidelines for relevant Orphan Medicinal Products and support the implementation of same. <\/p>  <p>  Dr. Michael Barry was appointed the Chair of the Committee on the 13 September 2017.

Reports on Portlaoise hospital in recent years have pointed to the need for reconfiguration of some services to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff that can safely meet their needs.  Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies, and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure that services currently provided that are not sustainable are discontinued and those that are, are safety assured and adequately resourced.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that hospital funding has increased by 28% relative to the 2012 budget and staffing levels have risen by 29% from the 2014 base.

The Deputy may be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013.  Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government   acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Government's legislative programme for 2017 includes the Health (Transport Support) Bill.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:<\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  The draft General Scheme and Heads of Bill were circulated to other government Departments and have been the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  When the consultation with other relevant Departments has been completed, the next step will be to seek Government approval to the drafting of a Bill for the new Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.<\/p>  <p>  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the importance of access to planned respite, which ensures that people with disabilities receive opportunities to socialise and separately, facilitates families to receive a break from caring.  Respite services may vary, according to the assessed needs of the individuals and their carer.  The model of respite is changing and although some still require overnight respite, others prefer and benefit from day respite.  The number of respite nights has been reducing as persons with disabilities are seeking alternative models, such as day respite or extended day.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent available data from the HSE indicates that for 2016, 175,555 overnight respite sessions and 43,143 day sessions were accessed.  It is planned that 161,262 overnight respite sessions will be accessed in 2017.  The number of day respite sessions planned is 42,552. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE will provide 128 new emergency residential placements and new home support and in-home respite for 75 additional people who require emergency supports. <\/p>  <p>  In the HSE's Social Care Operational Plan for 2017, 5,720 people with a Disability are expected to avail of centre-based respite services.

This Review will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital facilities.  It has involved a major data gathering exercise in relation to activity, un-met demand and capacity within the acute, primary and social care services sectors, analysis of that data, baseline forecasting of both demand and associated capacity requirements for each health sector and consideration and modelling of the potential impacts of policy change and productivity improvements.  The Review will provide a basis for determining both the extent of capacity requirements over the next 15 years and the type of capacity needed.  The findings will also inform the development of a new 10 year national capital plan.

The Communication proposes a simpler CAP, with\u00a0a sharper focus on objectives and results, particularly in the environmental area.  I\u00a0welcome the commitment that Direct Payments should remain an essential part of CAP, as they provide an important safety net for family farms and ensure there is agricultural activity in all parts of the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  The Communication outlines a number of possibilities that should be explored to improve the targeting of\u00a0direct payments, including compulsory capping of payments, degressive\u00a0payments and redistributive payments to small or medium size farms.  It also suggests that support is targeted to genuine farmers, focussing on those who are actively farming in order to earn their living.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently reviewing the Communication but of course detailed proposals will only emerge in the context of legislative provisions to be presented by Summer 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Degressivity involves the reduction of payments above a certain threshold.  Under the current CAP, degressivity was possible for payments exceeding &euro;150,000.  Ireland has effectively decided to limit the maximum\u00a0amount payable to an applicant under the Basic Payment Scheme (excluding the Greening Payment)\u00a0to &euro;150,000 per annum by applying 100% degressivity after that amount, as provided for under Article 11 of Regulation 1307\/2013.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the\u00a02016 Programme for Government, proposed a lowering of the cap on basic payments from &euro;150,000 to &euro;100,000.

The Tillage Sector is a very important sector to the agricultural economy, making a vital contribution to both the food and feedstuffs sector and in this connection I want to highlight the actions my Department has undertaken this year to assist this vital sector.  <\/p>  <p>  I introduced the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme in January of this year and extended it to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors.  The banks have advised that all of the &euro;150m available under the scheme has been committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  There has been a very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low cost flexible finance.  I met with the Chief Executives of the participating banks to discuss this and other access to finance issues relating to the agri-food sector.  I have asked the banks to respond positively to the demand that has been demonstrated by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.  The &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Loan Scheme&rdquo; has provided a template for access to finance schemes, including the recently announced &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; for SMEs.  I announced in the Budget that I have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of new Brexit response loan schemes during 2018 for farmers, fishermen and food businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  As a further support to tillage farmers the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme under TAMS II opened for online applications on the 8 March 2017.  The specific areas of investment include Minimum Disturbance Tillage Equipment, Sprayers, Rain Water Harvesting, Grain Storage and Grain dryers.\u00a0\u00a0All applications must be made on-line, either by the farmer or by an adviser authorised to act on his or her behalf.\u00a0 The second tranche of support under this scheme closed on Friday the 6 October 2017. \u00a0There has been a significant level of interest in investments by the tillage sector with a total number of 687 applications now received (including most recent tranche)\u00a0and 457 approvals have now issued with payments and approvals continuing on an ongoing basis.  This Tillage Scheme is the latest of the Targeted Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II) to be launched under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Scheme is co-funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures on the 26 July 2017 in response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016 I introduced a Weather Related Crop Loss Support measure to assist farmers who experienced significant yield losses in spring cereal crops.  This measure provides for a financial contribution of up to &euro;200 per hectare up to a maximum of 35 hectares per eligible applicant towards the cost of uninsured spring cereals crop losses in excess of 30% by yield.  <\/p>  <p>  Particularly hard hit growers who experienced cereal crop losses in excess of 50% will benefit from an additional &euro;100 per hectare, on the same area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200089#WRR03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Communities","counter":937,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200089#WRR03600"},{"type":"question","counter":938,"qnumday":385,"qnumall":"[52776\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200089#WRR03700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the recommendations of the 2014 report on promoting sustainable rural coastal and island communities by the Joint Sub-Committee on Fisheries that have been implemented to date; the recommendations of the report that have yet to be implemented; the reason for the delay in that regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":939,"content":"<p>The Sub-Committee report to which the Deputy refers made a number of recommendations which concerned a range of Government policies including natural resources, marine safety and social protection.\u00a0 I intend to address progress on aspects relevant to my remit as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A number of the recommendations have been superseded by initiatives which have taken place.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In relation to representation structures for the industry for instance, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) and Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) provide arenas for inshore fishermen to develop proposals on inshore fisheries management, including compliance and data gathering.  The NIFF is representative of the fishing boats of less than 12 m overall length in the fishing fleet.\u00a0 The focus on the NIFF work programme is on fisheries management in the coastal waters within 6 nautical miles.\u00a0 The NIFF is taking the lead in setting priorities for policy development including ongoing work in developing a dedicated strategy for the inshore sector.\u00a0 <\/p><p>To date, the twelve NIFF meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies &amp;amp; initiatives.NIFF members are now included on a number of fisheries consultative structures including the Quota Management Advisory Committee, the Industry Science Fisheries Partnership, the SFPA Consultative Committee, the EMFF Operational Programme Monitoring Committee and BIM\/Bord Bia Market Advisory Group.\u00a0 This gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on range of fisheries policy matters including on allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, on data collection and scientific research.\u00a0 Perhaps most important of these is that the NIFF now has a say on how funding is utilised including through the Inshore Fisheries Conservation Scheme.<\/p><p>The Sub-Committee&rsquo;s report refers to managing the lobster and shrimp fisheries.\u00a0 Changes came into effect in 2014 regarding the management of these fisheries, following on from an extensive consultation process.\u00a0 In more recent times lobster in particular has been a feature of the agenda of the meetings which I have had with the NIFF and I look forward to a discussion with NIFF on the review of the effectiveness of the current conservation measures in 2018.\u00a0 <\/p><p>With regard to the mackerel quota, there has been a change to the way this is allocated.\u00a0 For 2017 and future years, the 87% to 13% share out of the quota between the Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW) pelagic fleet and polyvalent segment of the fleet will remain unchanged.\u00a0 Where Ireland&rsquo;s quota exceeds 90,000 tonnes, the quota shall be shared on a 80% to 20% basis between the pelagic and polyvalent fleet.\u00a0 A minimum of 2% of the mackerel quota, or 1,000 tonnes, whichever is the greater will be deducted annually for demersal swaps before any share out between segments is undertaken.<\/p><p>There is an open mackerel fishery for vessels under 18 metres in length.\u00a0 An amount of 2.5% of the overall polyvalent Mackerel Quota has been set aside for this fishery and a monthly catch limit is used.\u00a0 This catch limit is recommended\u00a0each month by the Whitefish Quota Management Advisory Committee which consists of fishing industry representatives.  For 2017, under 18 m Boats may fish 5 tonnes per month.\u00a0 In the last number of years much of this quota has remained under-utilised.<\/p><p>The sub-committee made a recommendation with regard to &ldquo;minor fishing infractions&rdquo;.\u00a0 In November 2014, my Department published a public consultation document in the form of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA)\u00a0 of a proposal for a Bill to amend the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 to provide for, <i>inter alia<\/i>, a system of fixed penalty notices\u00a0 (&ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; fines) for minor fisheries offences.  This provided the possibility of creating a subset of minor offences which are legally suitable to be dealt with by way of fixed penalty notices.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In summary, the process suggested in the RIA involved giving a person who was alleged to have committed a minor offence an option to pay a fixed payment which would mean that a prosecution would not be taken in the Courts.\u00a0\u00a0If the payment was not received within 28 days, the prosecution would be initiated in the courts and on conviction it was expected that a higher fine would be applied.<\/p><p>A number of industry submissions received under the RIA on the implementation of fixed penalty notices raised concerns that these would be used in place of verbal or written warnings.\u00a0 Other comments raised concerns regarding potential inequalities in the application of the system between different Sea Fisheries Protection Authority Port Officers and Naval Service personnel.\u00a0 There were also comments regarding the constitutionality of applying sanctions in the absence of a Court decision and others seeking a fully administrative system.\u00a0 In light of the comments submitted in respect of the above proposal on a fixed penalty system,\u00a0it was decided not to proceed with the introduction such a system.<\/p><p>With regard to fishing infrastructure, it is important to say that my Department owns, maintains and directly manages six Fishery Harbour Centres.\u00a0\u00a0The network of Harbours, located at Killybegs, Ros an Mh&iacute;l , An Daingean, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth, are a valuable and vital resource to the Irish fishing fleet.  The Fishery Harbour Centres provide state of the art facilities and infrastructure for the increasingly mobile and large scale Irish and EU fishing industries.<\/p><p>In 2017, I allocated a total of &euro;3.8 million to the Local Authority Programme.\u00a0 This vital funding targeted 67 approved Local Authority projects with a wide geographical spread, 55 of which are harbour development requiring funding of &euro;2.94 million and 12 relate to marine leisure requiring funding of &euro;879,750.\u00a0 The infrastructure supported will be of great benefit to many rural coastal and island communities.<\/p><p>With regard to progress on aquaculture, in May 2017 I published the report of the Independent Review Group on aquaculture licensing which contained 30 key recommendations across a full range of activities.\u00a0 Additional staff have been assigned to the Aquaculture licensing division of the Department so as to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations.<\/p><p>My Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme is the vehicle for financial supports to the seafood sector up to 2021.\u00a0 The Programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 15 schemes including specifically in relation to Fisheries Local Action Groups.Individual schemes are administered by BIM and I will ask BIM to update the Deputy on recommendations relevant to its remit.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In summary, there are a number of recommendations not relevant to the remit of my Department and I have endeavoured to give the Deputy an update on relevant matters, including policy developments, which have occurred since the report was published.

This sustainability and efficiency will be achieved through improved nutrient management with more targeted use of fertiliser, better farmyard practice, more widespread use of sustainability approaches developed by Teagasc and the development of new approaches to reducing nutrient losses\u00a0in critical source areas.<\/p>  <p>  Through a commitment from both the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government\u00a0and support by industry, the 30 Advisors will work within a unified partnership structure which encompasses Teagasc, the Co-ops and the local authorities Water and Communities Office (LAWCO).  The new Sustainability Advisors will proactively advise and work with farmers to protect and improve water quality.  The Programme will draw on the experience and resources of key sectoral and industry stakeholders including the two Departments, the local authorities, the Dairy Co-ops, Teagasc, Bord Bia and the farm organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme, the new team will promote on-farm sustainability best practice to all farmers.\u00a0 In addition, local authorities - with the technical support of the Environmental Protection Agency - will identify risk areas at local level.\u00a0 Teagasc and the Co-ops will then provide advice and support to farmers in managing on-farm risks, working also with local farm organisations.  The Co-ops will support sustainability best practice through their structures, promoting best farm practice and nutrient management processes across all their suppliers.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme has the potential to strengthen delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Water Framework Directive.  It is part of a new approach to River Basin Management Planning for the 2018 &ndash; 2021 cycle.

The increased funding will allow rollout of a number of key programmes to address congestion and emerging capacity constraints on our public transport system to address congestion in the greater Dublin area and I would like to set these out as follows.<\/p>  <p>  The four-year capital envelope for public transport includes investment of over &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme to address growing congestion in the Dublin region\u00a0in the short to medium term.\u00a0\u00a0This\u00a0programme,\u00a0which was launched earlier this year by the National Transport Authority (NTA), is a plan to fundamentally transform Dublin&rsquo;s bus system, so that journeys for passengers by bus will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable.  It represents a reimagining of bus transport for the Dublin region.  At the heart of\u00a0this proposal to develop continuous bus lanes as far as is practicable along the busiest bus corridors along with a network of park and ride facilities at key locations. \u00a0Work is ongoing on the redesign of the bus services network and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme.\u00a0 When this work is\u00a0completed\u00a0the\u00a0proposals will be launched for public consultation in the first half of next year.\u00a0 The results of the public consultation will inform the final decisions to be made on the network redesign and the Core Bus Corridors including specific routes and corridors.<\/p>  <p>  The four-year capital envelope for public transport will also enable increased investment in the order of &euro;130 for sustainable transport projects in our main cities including Dublin.\u00a0 This investment is aimed at\u00a0traffic management measures, bus priority and other smarter travel projects in order to\u00a0allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and to ease traffic congestion.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Over &euro;110 million will also be invested in new urban cycling and walking routes in our main cities, including Dublin, which will provide additional sustainable travel options to complement increased capacity and faster, higher quality public transport. <\/p>  <p>  Around &euro;230 million is being provided to progress DART Expansion and associated mainline rail enhancements.  This will enable acceleration of\u00a0the initial stages of the overall DART Expansion Programme, focusing on providing additional fleet to enhance capacity, and extending the electrified DART system.  Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on\u00a0electrification of both the Northern rail line as far as\u00a0Balbriggan\u00a0and\u00a0the Maynooth line.  Notwithstanding the funding constraints over the last few years, a major upgrading of the City Centre Re-signalling programme was progressed and is already well advanced to completion.  Furthermore, limited design work has been carried out on electrification of the Northern Line to Balbriggan to date.  Following the additional funding announced as a result of the capital plan review, it is intended to reactivate the design and planning work for this project during 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to also advise the Deputy that in the interim, the NTA, in conjunction with Irish Rail, continues to examine short and medium term options for meeting increased commuter demand on the Northern commuter line.

All children will be eligible to 76 weeks or 2 academic years of ECCE from September 2018.  On Wednesday 6 December I announced that I have paused a decision on the upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur.  This means that for the 2018\/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.  Since ECCE was introduced in 2010, approximately 500 children availed of the exemption each year, although for reasons set out below, it is expected that much fewer than this would have applied in 2018.  I hope that my decision of last Wednesday will bring the parents who planned to apply for this overage exemption from September 2018 some relief and I encourage them to make sure their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision.  The recent announcement of changes was designed to support the achievement of better outcomes for children with disabilities.  No child would have lost out as a result of the overage exemption being removed. <\/p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two.  Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved.  This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six.  The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland.  Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities.  If children are not in school by the age of six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school.  Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education.  Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, DCYA has worked, with some success, to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development. The two main enhancements are:<\/p>  <p>  -  ECCE provision currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018.  This is in keeping with good international practice.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities.  Over 4,000 children have so far benefited from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.<\/p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the programme.  This was signalled last year, but in order to give longer notice to parents and providers, the planned introduction was delayed until September 2018.  The motivation underpinning this development is entirely evidence based.  Children with a disability benefit from early intervention, high quality early childhood care and education and high quality primary school education.  In this regard my Department is complementing the work of the HSE's role in early intervention and the Department of Educations and Skill's role in high quality primary school education by:<\/p>  <p>  -  expanding the ECCE programme so that all children have access to a full 76 weeks, double what was available in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  -  providing access to the comprehensive suite of resources under the Access and Inclusion model (AIM), introduced in September 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The evidence is that children with a disability should start school with their peers once they have access to high quality and inclusive primary school education.  The evidence is also that they should become teenagers with their peers and transition to secondary school with their peers. <\/p>  <p>  The original decision to remove the overage exemption was made with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and in close collaboration with members of the AIM Cross-Sectoral Implementation Group, which includes representatives from the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, the HSE, a representative of parents of children with special needs and a representative of early years providers.  There was broad agreement that, in light of the very significant developments and improvements to free pre-school education, both in terms of the two year duration of ECCE and the range of supports available, and the very significant supports that are in place for children in primary schools, the overage exemption would no longer support the overarching policy aim that children should transition to primary school with their peers.  The decision acknowledged the  supports provided by the relevant primary school, the National Council for Special Education and other bodies as required. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the strong evidence base underpinning this proposal as being in the best interests of the children concerned, and the significant enhancements to the ECCE scheme in terms of two years duration and access to AIM supports; measures which effectively address the reasons for introducing the overage exemptions in the first place, I am also conscious of the need to listen further to those with concerns.  To this end, as stated above, I have paused the proposed change and committed to consulting more widely with parents of children with disabilities.  I have also committed to having this consultation completed by mid 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200093#WRV03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Safety","counter":1156,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200093#WRV03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1157,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[52697\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200093#WRV03900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if allegations of inappropriate behaviour with the children of a person (details supplied) have been investigated; if a related agreement has been reached including a confidentiality clause in respect the complaint or in parallel with the complaint; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1158,"content":"<p>While it is not appropriate for me to comment on an individual case, Tusla have advised me that the person named made a complaint in 2009 and a report on the findings in relation to this complaint was issued to him in 2010.

My Department acknowledges that pay and conditions are major issues facing the sector and can lead to difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is somewhat constrained in what it can do in this regard as it is not an employer of childcare workers.  However it is of course a major funder of the childcare sector. It is important to note that the most important stakeholders in putting agreed pay structures in place in any sector are recognised employers and employee groups. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that trade unions are active in seeking to achieve a critical mass of representation on the employee side and, I welcome this move.  My Department would also be supportive of any move on the employer side to establish a recognised representative body. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of improving pay and conditions I have suggested to the sector that it might apply to the Labour Court for a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO), asking the Court to make a recommendation in relation to pay for the whole early years sector. <\/p>  <p>  Under an SEO process, organisations substantially representative of employers and employees come together to agree a way forward and submissions are sought from key stakeholders.  While my Department would have no direct role in relation to the SEO process, as a significant funder, and with policy responsibility for quality, it would be well placed to make a submission to the Court once it publishes its notice in relation to the application for a SEO for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, the last three Budgets have increased investment in Early Years by some 87%.  This has helped us to address affordability, access and quality, although I recognise that there is more to be done.  This year's announcement of a 7% increase in ECCE capitation is intended to support the workforce.  The &euro;18m in 2017 to support 'non-contact time' or the administration burden associated with the scheme, is also intended to support providers and their employees.<\/p>  <p>  I will be very supportive of any reasonable measures aimed at improving pay and conditions of the Early Years sector.

All children will be entitled to 76 weeks or 2 academic years of ECCE from September 2018.  On Wednesday 6 December I announced that I have paused a decision on the upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur.  This means that for the 2018\/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.  Since ECCE was introduced in 2010, approximately 500 children availed of the exemption each year, although for reasons set out below, it is expected that much fewer than this would have applied in 2018.  I hope that my decision of last Wednesday will bring the parents who planned to apply for this overage exemption from September 2018 some relief and I encourage them to make sure their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision.

All children will be entitled to 76 weeks or 2 academic years of ECCE from September 2018.  On Wednesday 6 December I announced that I have paused a decision on the upper age limit exemption for ECCE so that further consultation with parents can occur.  This means that for the 2018\/2019 ECCE year the overage exemption will continue to be available.  Since ECCE was introduced in 2010, approximately 500 children availed of the exemption each year, although for reasons set out below, it is expected that much fewer than this would have applied in 2018.  I hope that my decision of last Wednesday will bring the parents who planned to apply for this overage exemption from September 2018 some relief and I encourage them to make sure their views are represented in the consultation that will occur over the coming months, the details of which I will publish shortly. <\/p>  <p>  It is important that I set out the rationale for the original decision.  The recent announcement of changes was designed to support the achievement of better outcomes for children with disabilities.  No child would have lost out as a result of the overage exemption being removed. <\/p>  <p>  Overage exemptions were introduced at the onset of the ECCE programme in 2010.  At that time, the ECCE Programme only operated for a 38 week period, or one programme year.  For some children with special\/additional needs, attending preschool five days a week was not feasible and so an allowance was made to enable them split ECCE over 2 years, for example, a child may have availed of 3 days ECCE provision in year one and 2 days in year two.  Their total ECCE provision remained at 38 weeks.<\/p>  <p>  In order to facilitate this, in the cases where the child would have been over the age limit for ECCE (5 years and 6 months when finishing ECCE) an overage exemption was approved.  This flexibility was never intended to conflict with the legislative requirement to start school by age six.  The law and policy on school start-age is clearly established in Ireland.  Children should be in school by the time they are six and the primary school system has a variety of resources to support children with disabilities.  If children are not in school by the age of six, under the Educational Welfare Act, the Educational Welfare service of Tusla must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school.  Tusla does this by sending Educational Welfare Inspectors out to the place of the child's education.  Should this be required, this would be in addition to the Early Years Inspectorates funded by my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Since ECCE was first introduced, DCYA has worked, with some success, to improve the pre-school experience for children with disabilities and to optimise their early development.  The two main enhancements are:<\/p>  <p>  -  ECCE entitlement currently averages at 61 weeks, up from 38 weeks, and it will expand further to 76 weeks from September 2018. This is in keeping with good international practice.<\/p>  <p>  -  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) has been introduced with 7 different levels of support for children with disabilities. Over 4,000 children have so far benefited from targeted supports and many multiples of this from universal supports available under AIM.<\/p>  <p>  Purely in the best interests of children, and for no other reason, a proposal was considered to remove the overage exemption to the upper age limit to the Programme.   This was signalled last year, but in order to give longer notice to parents and providers, the planned introduction was delayed until September 2018.  The motivation underpinning this development is entirely evidence based.  Children with a disability benefit from early intervention, high quality early childhood care and education and high quality primary school education.  In this regard my Department is complementing the work of the HSE's role in early intervention and the Department of Educations and Skill's role in high quality primary school education by:<\/p>  <p>  -  expanding the ECCE programme so that all children have access to a full 76 weeks, double what was available in 2010. <\/p>  <p>  -  providing access to the comprehensive suite of resources under the Access and Inclusion model (AIM), introduced in September 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The evidence is that children with a disability should start school with their peers once they have access to high quality and inclusive primary school education.  The evidence is also that they should become teenagers with their peers and transition to secondary school with their peers. <\/p>  <p>  The original decision to remove the overage exemption was made with the Department of Education and Skills (DES) and in close collaboration with members of the AIM Cross-Sectoral Implementation Group, which includes representatives from the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, the HSE, a representative of parents of children with special needs and a representative of early years providers.  There was broad agreement that, in light of the very significant developments and improvements to free pre-school education, both in terms of the two year duration of ECCE and the range of supports available, and the very significant supports that are in place for children in primary schools, the overage exemption would no longer support the overarching policy aim that children should transition to primary school with their peers.  The decision acknowledged the  supports provided by the relevant primary school, the National Council for Special Education and other bodies as required. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the strong evidence base underpinning this proposal as being in the best interests of the children concerned, and the significant enhancements to the ECCE scheme in terms of two years duration and access to AIM supports; measures which effectively address the reasons for introducing the overage exemptions in the first place, I am also conscious of the need to listen further to those with concerns.  To this end, as stated above, I have paused the proposed change and committed to consulting more widely with parents of  children with disabilities.

Part 3.9.4 of these regulations established a minimum qualification standard for those working directly with pre-school children.  This qualification standard was introduced following extensive consultation with the Early Years sector, and the intention to introduce a minimum qualification standard was announced as far back as 2013.  It was broadly welcomed as being in the best interests of children.<\/p>  <p>  Extensive funding was made available over a period of four years to allow sector workers to undertake, upgrade or update their qualifications.  To facilitate those who had many years experience in the sector but were unwilling or unable to pursue new training, a 'grandfathering' clause was included in the Regulations.  Those wishing to avail of the option of signing a 'grandfathering' declaration were able to do so through their local County\/City Childcare Committee (CCC), but as is standard with such derogations, the option was available only up to a certain point in time.  'Grandfathering' declarations must have been signed by the 30th June 2016, at which point the regulations commenced.

To this end, I am examining carefully how best to strengthen it. <\/p>  <p>  Any reforms will be informed by the ESRI review of the Programme, which acknowledged its great contribution to vulnerable children, but which pointed to the need for an improved governance structure and revised model of employment. <\/p>  <p>  In particular, I want to ensure that services under the Programme are compliant with financial and governance rules, and that we have a good model of service delivery throughout the country.  I also want to ensure that those employed under the Programme have clear contracts of employment and that their work is properly coordinated. <\/p>  <p>  I am deeply committed to an effective reform of this programme, not only in relation to the governance and employment issues, but also the programmes, supports and processes that are in place to ensure that young people complete school.  I am reviewing the extensive consultation process that has been carried out. I am considering recommendations from the expert panel that Tusla has established to consider possible options for reform.  I also plan to consult with experts across the educational welfare sector before making any decisions. <\/p>  <p>  In my view the reform will incorporate universal supports as well as targeted supports to ensure that those most in need are reached by the programme.  It is critical that we have a whole school approach to this, as well as ensuring that other child and family supports, delivered by statutory or voluntary agencies, are integrated so that the child or young person has the best chance of staying in school.  I am also committed to incorporating recognition of the strengths and capabilities of the child or young person into these reforms.  I believe that the emotional stability young person is critical in enabling their engagement in learning, and contributes to their desire to finish school. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, Tusla's Educational Welfare Service has taken important steps to support the current service, including arranging independent Human Resources and Industrial Relations advice, and contracting with other parties to support governance, training and continued professional development of staff. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that the School Completion Programme deserves careful reflection and analysis so that we achieve the best possible reformed services for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200094#WRW03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":1211,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200094#WRW04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1212,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[53236\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200094#WRW04100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will raise with a company (details supplied) that are engaged by the HSE on State contracts the reason they do not recognise a union which represents its staff in view of the fact that they recognise a union in Northern Ireland; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1213,"content":"<p>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs have a contract with the organisation concerned to provide the pilot Bail Supervision Scheme for a 2 year period following a public tender.

The rate bands in place between 2000 and 2012 were more generous than those in place before and after that period, and were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension were maintained.  Instead of reducing those payments, which many vulnerable pensioners were solely reliant upon, the rates paid to new pensioners who both have additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, for a person with a yearly average of 20 contributions, the new rate of payment introduced in 2012 was still higher than the maximum rate that was in place at the start of 2006.  Also, it should be noted that in all European countries and beyond, pension reforms have been introduced to make them more sustainable, and these will generally result in people having different payments depending upon when they reach pension age.  The only way to avoid this would be to introduce the reforms for existing pensioners, and decrease the incomes pensioners have become dependent upon.<\/p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are better than proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension, which compares favourably with contributory pensions in other EU countries.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year. <\/p>  <p>  The Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension, had the rate bands not been amended in 2012. <\/p>  <p>  As soon as the report is finished I intend to bring it to a cabinet committee meeting and subsequently to Government for consideration early in the New Year.<\/p>  <p>  If there are equitable changes that target relief to those who were particularly affected by anomalies under the yearly average system, especially if they had home-making periods prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme, I will ask Government to consider if and how these might be financed. <\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework proposed that a total contribution approach should replace the yearly average approach to the calculation of the State Pension (contributory).  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid would more closely reflect the total number of Social Insurance contributions made by a person throughout her or his working life and the incongruities of the Yearly Averaging method of calculating entitlement would be removed.  It is expected that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from 2020. <\/p>  <p>  A discussion paper is being drafted by my Department and it is hoped to start the consultation process with relevant stakeholders including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas shortly.  Following the consultation period, a proposal to Government will be submitted seeking approval of the new approach. <\/p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200095#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Eligibility","counter":1249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200095#WRX03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1250,"qnumday":500,"qnumall":"[52720\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200095#WRX03200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to extend the allowable period for persons to work under the community employment scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1251,"content":"<p><b><\/b>My Department provides a range of activation supports catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market.  These supports include employment programmes such as Community Employment (CE).  The purpose of CE is to help a person re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine.  Participation on CE is intended to be for a temporary fixed-term.  Participation limits are in place to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from the scheme and to meet the scheme&rsquo;s objectives of breaking the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market.<\/p><p>International evidence does not advocate a long-term dependency on work programmes.

This includes enhancing the position of the self-employed through a supportive tax regime and, very importantly, improving the level of PRSI based benefits available to self-employed people.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed people who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit.  <\/p>  <p>  Since March 2017, the self-employed have access to the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental examinations, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids.  Treatment benefit entitlements were also extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits. <\/p>  <p>  Even more significantly, self-employed contributors are now eligible for the invalidity pension from December 2017.  For the first time, this gives the self-employed access to the safety-net of State income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability without having to go through a means test.  This is a real advance in the level of cover available to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  There are also a range of other supports available to the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  Self-employed workers with insufficient means can access means tested payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, in respect of periods when they cannot work because of a downturn in their business or ill health.  Self-employed workers who are parenting alone can claim the One Parent Family Payment in the same manner as employees who are parenting alone.<\/p>  <p>  The back to work family dividend (BTWFD) scheme aims to help families, including self-employed families, to move from social welfare into employment.

In the case of jobseekers, the qualifying period required for access to the BTWEA is 12 months in receipt of a jobseekers payment, provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA).  Jobseekers who were previously self-employed, similar to PAYE workers, may access social welfare supports, including BTWEA, by establishing eligibility to JA.   <\/p>  <p>  The short term enterprise allowance provides immediate access to those who have lost their jobs and qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and wish to set up a business.

No commitment to remit this &euro;750,000 was subsequently given either at the meeting of 7 September 2016 or in the intervening period or at any time since.  <\/p>  <p>  A similar amount of &euro;1m was included in the 2015 Local Property Tax allocation to Sligo County Council.  Payment of this again remained conditional on a plan being agreed and discussions with the Council, in this context, continued.  A financial plan was subsequently agreed and an additional &euro;1m was paid in December 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  On 7 July 2016, eight months after the plan was agreed, Sligo County Council advised my Department that its surplus target for 2016 would not be met, and that the surplus would fall short of the &euro;2.3 million target agreed the previous November by &euro;1.092 million.  My Department accommodated this change, with the target for 2016 revised down from &euro;2.3m to &euro;1.598m.  Sligo County Council confirmed, in its letter of 13 October 2016, that it had the ability to meet the revised target for 2016 but would not be able to meet the target of &euro;3.41 million planned for 2017.  On 4 November 2016 it confirmed that it was budgeting for a surplus for 2017 of &euro;1.6m.  On 20 December 2016 it further reduced the surplus envisaged for future years to a maximum of &euro;1.6m per annum, and requested that timescales be reviewed.  In its letter of 12 April 2017 it advised that the maximum annual sustainable surplus was &euro;600k, and outlined three options for adjustments to timescales.  My Department accepted a timescale to 2027 which would see surpluses of &euro;600k generated each year between 2018 and 2027, notwithstanding the fact that this represents a considerable reduction on the original targets proposed of &euro;3.11 million for 2018 and &euro;2.81 million for 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1m was paid by my Department in both December 2016 and December 2017 when revised targets were met.  My Department has provided for further payment of &euro;200k per annum additional funding to Sligo County Council each year over a 10 year period from 2018 subject to Ministerial approval and any possible changes in Government policy over the intervening period.  Overall, this amounts to a total of &euro;5.25m additional funding to Sligo County Council.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Register","counter":1346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ01000"},{"type":"question","counter":1347,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[52596\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ01100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a reply will issue to a query (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1348,"content":"<p>Irish citizens are entitled to vote at Presidential, D&aacute;il, European Parliament and local elections as well as in referendums.

However, section 149 of the Electoral Act 1992 provides that\u00a0a person who is included in a register of electors that is currently in force but who is not entitled to be so included in the register shall be guilty of an offence if they vote.  There is a responsibility on each individual who votes to ensure that they are entitled to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to the evolving needs of Irish society and its relationship with the wider Irish diaspora, the Government agreed in March of this year to accept in principle the main recommendation in the Fifth Report of the Convention on the Constitution that Irish citizens resident outside the State, including citizens resident in Northern Ireland, should have the right to vote at Presidential elections and that a referendum would be held to amend the Constitution to give effect to this.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to inform public discourse on this significant policy change, an Options Paper was published on 22 March 2017 by my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Options Paper sets out a range of options as well as many of the legal, policy and logistical challenges associated with extending voting rights to Irish citizens resident outside the State.  The Options Paper also provided a basis for the discussion on voting rights which took place at the Global Irish Civic Forum in Dublin on 5 May 2017.  These discussions will inform the Government&rsquo;s decision on a preferred option to be put to the people in a referendum.  <\/p>  <p>  Even if a referendum was held immediately and passed, it would not be feasible to have comprehensive arrangements in place for an extension of the franchise to have effect for any presidential election to be held before 2025 as this will require modernisation of the voter registration process and the introduction of arrangements to facilitate those eligible to vote to exercise their franchise from outside the State.  In this regard, my Department has commenced work to effect improvements in, and to modernise, the process for the registration of voters.  All aspects of voter registration will be reviewed as part of this project.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government announced on 26 September 2017 that it has agreed indicative dates for the holding of referendums in 2018 and 2019, subject to the timely passage of Constitution Amendment Bills by each House of the Oireachtas.  Included in the list is the proposed referendum on extending the franchise at presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State which it is intended will be held on the date of the local and European elections in June 2019.  My Department will bring forward an appropriate Constitution Amendment Bill on extending the franchise at Presidential elections to Irish citizens resident outside the State in good time for the holding of the referendum.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment","counter":1349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1350,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[52642\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ01400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if a landlord is obliged at the request of an existing tenant to sign up to the housing assistance payment scheme in respect of a tenancy which is already in place; if that obligation changes over time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1351,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a form of social housing support provided by all local authorities.  HAP addresses many long standing issues raised by landlord groups in relation to the operation of Rent Supplement.  The HAP payment is made directly to landlords on the tenant's behalf and all payments are made electronically - the landlord does not have to collect the rent.  There are minimal barriers to setting up HAP, and\u00a0tax compliance and private rental inspections can follow the setting up of a HAP tenancy.  In 2016, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants and local authorities, and a 99% rent payment rate with virtually no difficulties arising for landlords.  Furthermore, any household assessed for social housing support is immediately eligible for housing support through the HAP scheme.  HAP recipients can avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent; under Rent Supplement, these households would lose their housing support payment.  <\/p><p>A landlord or an agent acting on behalf of a landlord is not legally obliged to enter into a tenancy agreement with a HAP recipient.  However, since 1 January 2016, a person cannot be discriminated against when renting because they are in receipt of certain housing related payments,\u00a0including HAP.  If a person feels that they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent, they can make a complaint under the Equal Status Acts to the\u00a0Workplace\u00a0Relations Commission.  Further information is available on the Commission's website,\u00a0.  <\/p><p>A number of cases have been taken under the 'housing assistance' ground of the Equality Act against landlords.  I believe that the body of case law that the Workplace\u00a0Relations Commission is building in this regard complements the clarity that my Department is working to provide to landlords and agents in relation to the operation of the HAP scheme.  It is clear that such cases are rare and the vast majority of landlords are happy to engage in the scheme, and adhere to the terms and conditions.  In fact, the average number of new\u00a0additional tenancies being\u00a0supported by HAP\u00a0per week over the last number of months is close to 350.  <\/p><p>Misunderstanding of the scheme can arise and\u00a0this highlights the need for the State to continue to explain and outline the many benefits of HAP to landlords.  My Department and local authorities have been involved in a range of national and local actions to clarify the operational benefits of HAP to landlords and agents.  <\/p><p>HAP is working for both recipients and landlords.  Over\u00a030,700 eligible households are currently being supported across the State with over 20,000 individual landlords and agents providing accommodation via the scheme and receiving housing assistance payments.  HAP will continue to be a flexible support available to assist people with their long term housing needs immediately their need arises.  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.  In\u00a0general,\u00a0I am satisfied with the operation of\u00a0HAP and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme outlined under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Reform","counter":1352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1353,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[52704\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he plans to conduct a review or plans revisions to the local government boundaries or distribution of seats within existing boundaries in advance of the 2019 local government elections.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1354,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government sets out a number of commitments in relation to local government reform to ensure that local government funding, structures\u00a0and responsibilities strengthen local democracy into the future.

Further, section 18(3) of the Acts provides that it &ldquo;shall be the duty of every person, being on premises to which section 18 of the Acts applies, to conduct himself in such a way as to ensure that as far as is reasonably practicable any person on the premises is not exposed to danger from fire as a consequence of any act or omission of his&rdquo;.  <\/p><p>Standards for the design and construction of buildings, including fire safety standards, are regulated under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 and the primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations, including fire safety, rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.  <\/p><p>As outlined above, the State regulates fire safety responsibility through its Building Control legislation and Fire Services Acts and associated regulations.  A range of enabling powers, including extensive powers of inspection and enforcement, are provided for local authorities under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 and the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003.  <\/p><p>Fire safety is achieved through the &ldquo;Prevent, Protect, Respond&rdquo; paradigm which is part of an overall fire risk management approach.  Local authorities provide a range of services aimed at enhancing fire safety in their communities by preventing fires from happening in the first instance, and ensuring appropriate fire protection measures are in place in buildings, in addition to providing an operational response.  <\/p><p>The fire prevention\/protection work falls into two categories known as Community Fire Safety and Technical Fire Safety. Community Fire Safety involves fire authorities working in partnership with relevant agencies and the community sector to provide safety measures such as domestic smoke alarms for those perceived as most vulnerable to fire in the home.  It also includes the Primary Schools Program whereby every third class in primary school receives age-appropriate education on fire safety issues.  The shift of emphasis to Community Fire Safety is seen as contributing to the overall downward trend in fire fatalities which reached a 40 year record low in 2016.  In relation to the Technical fire safety work, local authority fire services review and make recommendations in relation to applications for Fire Safety Certificates under Building Control legislation.  They also provide the fire safety input under various licensing systems.  They undertake inspection programmes in accordance with their established priorities (such as nursing homes) and they respond to complaints about fire safety in specific premises, using the various enforcement powers as appropriate.  <\/p><p>In April 2016, my Department published the report of the first External Validation process undertaken in relation to local authority fire services including fire safety, which was titled &quot;Local Delivery - National Consistency&quot;.  This report is available on my Department's website at the following link: .  <\/p><p>In response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June this year and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, on 27 June 2017, my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was tasked with convening and coordinating a high-level Task Force to lead Ireland&rsquo;s re-appraisal of fire safety.  The Task Force is reviewing existing arrangements and systems for fire safety and related issues which impact on fire safety in Ireland.  As it carries out its work, the Task Force is taking into account information and developments arising in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire.  <\/p><p>In addition to establishing the Task Force, local authorities were requested to undertake a number of initial actions and the Task Force was requested to oversee and report on a review of fire safety in both social housing and fire safety in medium to high rise buildings.  This initial work has been carried out and all local authorities have reported back to my Department as requested.  The Fire Safety Task Force\u00a0 is analysing the returns received currently and is preparing an initial report which I expect to be submitted by early January 2018.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Members","counter":1380,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1381,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[53140\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017121200097#WRZ04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to introduce a statutory requirement for local authorities to provide timely and substantive responses to representations made by local elected representatives and councillors to their respective local authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1382,"content":"<p>Under the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, each local authority has an elected council.

I understand that he retention of such specialists has proved challenging for many military forces internationally and it is not unique to Ireland.<\/p><p>To address such issues a range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions and the scope to further expand direct entry is being considered.  I have also directed civil and military management to develop proposals for expanding direct entry recruitment of specialists and a scheme to facilitate former PDF personnel with appropriate skill-sets to re-enter the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>In addition to my commitment to maximising recruitment I am cognisant of factors that can influence retention of existing members of the Defence Forces.  I remain dedicated to ensuring that the terms and conditions of service, while remaining appropriate to the needs of the organisation, are as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there is an ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation.  The Defence Forces Climate Survey identified a range of issues that were identified as impacting on satisfaction levels within the PDF.  Whilst pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces was highlighted as an issue, there were a broad range of HR matters raised.  I am satisfied that these are being addressed and I have recently announced a number of initiatives ranging from a review of the C&amp;amp;A Scheme, a review of the criteria governing Contracts for enlisted personnel and a comprehensive skills gap analysis across the Defence Forces.  These directly address issues raised in the Climate Study. In addition the Chief of Staff is actively addressing matters relating to military management of work practices in the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>Following sign up by the Defence Forces Representative Associations to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, members of the Permanent Defence Force have benefited from pay increases.  These post-dated the Climate Survey.  I was particularly pleased with recent adjustments to salary scales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since 2013 (increases of between 8% and 24% depending on scale point).  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 also provides for further pay increases ranging from 5.75% to 7.25% depending on the individual&rsquo;s current wage threshold and this is under consideration by RACO and PDFORRA. <\/p><p>The fact that further consideration by the Public Service Pay Commission of recruitment and retention issues is provided for under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, is also a welcome development. <\/p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and abroad.<\/p><p><b>Establishment Vs Strength (WTE) &ndash;

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s fishery protection legislation and our obligations as a member of the European Union.  In its fishery protection role, the Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol at any one time.  However, when on patrol Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties.<\/p>  <p>  Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps&rsquo; Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance within the Irish EEZ using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft which were acquired in 1994 under the terms of the 1991 to 1995 Fishery Protection Programme.  These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment which offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service.

The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve. <\/p><p>I am aware that there is a shortfall between these figures and those of the established strength, which provides for 4,069 personnel. As an immediate measure to begin to rectify this shortfall by bolstering the strength of the Reserve, a recruitment campaign to the Army Reserve and Naval Service began in July 2017 and attracted 1,221 applications.  A total of 128 personnel have been inducted to the Reserve Defence Forces in 2017 which is an increase of some 60% when compared to the 80 personnel inducted in 2016.  The recruitment process has also been streamlined so as to make it more efficient.<\/p><p>Given the competing recruitment demands at present, where PDF recruitment is and should remain a priority, recruitment to the Reserve is continuing.
