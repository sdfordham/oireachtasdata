Ireland will exit the excessive procedure because the general government deficit will be substantially below\u00a03% of GDP in 2015. Indeed, the strong end-year Exchequer figures indicate that, all things being equal, the deficit for 2015 will be closer to 1&frac12;% of GDP, down from the budget day forecast of 2.1% of GDP.

The level of economic activity is already above pre-crisis levels, but importantly it is now more balanced than was the case at the height of the bubble, when it was driven largely by construction. Indeed, employment in 12 of the 14 economic sectors, highlighted in the recent Quarterly National Household Survey, has increased.

Relevant actions taken by the Central Bank in recent years have been extensive and include inter alia capital assessment reviews, stress tests, distressed credit operation reviews, balance sheet assessment exercises, SME loan resolution bank specific targets, on-site inspections and on-going, intensive supervisory engagement with the banks regarding distressed debt. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013 non-public institution specific SME distressed loan resolution targets were set for a number of banks.

Where risks are identified, lenders should engage with borrowers in an appropriate and consumer-focussed way and consider options to facilitate the borrower in meeting their mortgage obligations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA03100"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[1334\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will legislate to allow the Central Bank of Ireland to cap interest rates charged by banks on mortgages, particularly standard variable rate mortgages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, I have taken steps to ensure that banks provide\u00a0options for mortgage holders to reduce their repayments.\u00a0\u00a0Last May, I met with the six main mortgage lenders and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high.\u00a0The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers. <\/p>  <p>  In September I concluded a series of\u00a0follow up meetings with the financial institutions\u00a0and the reality is that\u00a0the main banks\u00a0have put options in place to allow borrowers reduce their repayments.\u00a0Obviously, it is a matter for each individual borrower to\u00a0decide what suits their circumstances but I encour age borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory. I asked the banks to provide options by which borrowers could reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place. It is up to the individual banks themselves to advertise their rates and products but as I am sure you are aware, some banks have focussed on fixed rate offerings\u00a0or rates based on loan-to-value, while others have\u00a0reduced their variable rates.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am pleased to see that new initiatives and reductions continue to take place. As recently as last week one bank introduced a 0.5% reduction on managed variable rates for new or switcher mortgages with a loan to value of 80% or less. Another bank reduced its SVR\u00a0in December.\u00a0These initiatives illustrate the increasing competitive dynamics in the market. <\/p>  <p>  I note that the Central Bank's statistical release of 11th December 2015 stated that\u00a0mortgage interest rates generally declined during the third quarter of 2015. Variable Principal Dwelling House (PDH) rates declined by 17 basis points over the second quarter\u00a0with corresponding Buy-to-Let (BTL) rates falling by 14 basis points during the same period. <\/p>  <p>  There has been discussion in the public domain over the last number of months regarding whether the regulation of interest rates would lead to a reduction in mortgage costs for borrowers. I believe that competition rather than regulation represents the best long term solution to this issue and Central Bank and ESRI research supports this position. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard,\u00a0the previous Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, indicated his opposition to the administrative control of interest rates. While he acknowledged that a reduction in bank interest rates would benefit the economy at large, it was his firm belief that the introduction of administrative control on interest rates in Ireland would be bad for the country as a whole in the medium term \u00a0including its negative effect on the entry of other banks to the market.<\/p>  <p>You will also be aware that on 12 November the Central Bank published a consultation paper on proposed increased protections for variable rate mortgage customers. This is called Consultation Paper CP98 and is available on their website. The suggested measures fall under three broad categories:<\/p>  <p>  - Lenders would be required to publish a summary statement of the factors that impact on their variable rate and the criteria and procedures that apply to setting such rates;<\/p>  <p>  - On an annual basis lenders would be required to notify variable borrowers of alternative mortgage options.\u00a0 They would also have to notify borrowers of these options when increasing SVR rates and provide borrowers with a link to the Competition and Consumer Protection (CCPC) website to assist borrowers who wish to switch;<\/p>  <p>  - The Central Bank is consulting on increasing the notification period for variable rate increases (it is currently 30 days) and they are also consulting on a proposal to require the lender to state the reason for changing the rate.<\/p>  <p>  The closing date for submissions to the public consultation is 12 February 2016. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":35,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA03400"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[1273\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the advice he received from his Department opposing the introduction of a tax on sugar;

Once the company has commenced trading, they can then seek further investments under the EII.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - The Start Your Own Business\u00a0initiative provides an exemption from income tax\u00a0for 2 years for individuals starting a new business where the individuals were previously long-term unemployed. The profits of such a business, up to a maximum of &euro;40,000, are relieved from income tax in each year of the first two years of trading. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware also of a number of corporation tax relief measures which are available to all corporate taxpayers throughout Ireland, such as the R&amp;D tax credit and the 3 year corporation tax relief for start-up companies.\u00a0 While these are not specifically targeted at development on a regional level they would nonetheless be available to taxpayers in the regions to stimulate investment and development.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the overall question, any incentive targeting a specific location is likely to be subject to EU State Aid rules, and needs to be carefully considered in order to achieve the necessary results and obtain the necessary approval of the European Commission. Also, a tax incentive alone will have limited impact on regional development.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I would note that there is no provision under the EU VAT directive which allows for different VAT rates to be charged on depending on the region in which the activity takes place.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that there are non tax related measures in place to promote investment and development regionally. In particular up to the end of September 2015 the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has lent approximately &euro;110 million to c.3200 SMEs across Ireland. The vast majority of these loans, approximately 85%, were to regionally based SMEs outside of Dublin. The average size of these loans is about &euro;35,000 and more than 90% have been for investment purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA05700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Operations","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA05800"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[1271\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA05900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there are any plans to introduce individual savings accounts, similar to those in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1206","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>While all taxation measures are kept under review, there are no immediate plans to introduce a scheme similar to the UK's Individual Savings Account (ISA) \u00a0scheme in Ireland.<\/p><p>However, the National Treasury Management Agency, through An Post, offers a number of State Savings products, including Savings Bonds and Savings Certificates, which are tax free, subject to certain conditions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA06000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Administration","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA06100"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[1336\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has carried researched the likely increase in local property tax that will be faced by liable residents if this tax is not abolished and if the deferral of valuations for the purpose of the tax is not renewed in 2019.","asker":"1080","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>I am\u00a0very conscious of the concerns of homeowners over increasing property prices and the effects this will have on their Local Property Tax (LPT) liabilities, particularly in urban areas.\u00a0 For this reason I asked Dr Don Thornhill to review the operation of the LPT and, in particular, any impacts on LPT liabilites due to recent property price developments. Dr Thornhill's review has been published and is available on the Department of Finance website. <\/p>  <p>  In the course of the review, the Economics Division of the Department of Finance prepared estimates of the potential implications on taxpayer liabilities of price developments as a result of price increases since May 2013.\u00a0 The paper prepared by the Economics Division is included in Dr Thornhill's report at Chapter 7.\u00a0 I can confirm that the discussion and analysis undertaken in the course of the review did not, however, take account of projected price movements after that date.\u00a0 This was because residential price movements show considerable volatility not just from year to year but quarter to quarter. Any forward projections would be highly conjectural and run the possible risk of providing a poor basis for policy making. <\/p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Amendment Act 2015 was enacted in the last D&aacute;il term. Among other things, it defers revaluation of properties for LPT purposes from 1 November 2016 to 1 November 2019; self-assessed valuations for properties made by homeowners as of 1 May 2013 stand for a further 3 years, until 1 November 2019, and this means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values. This arises out of one of the recommendations of the review.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Report will be a matter for consideration by the next Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA06300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Liquidation","counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA06400"},{"type":"question","counter":66,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[1350\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA06500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 166 of 15 July 2014, the schedule and periodic amounts, under which the proceeds of the sale of the Central Bank of Ireland's &euro;25 billion floating rate notes and &euro;3.4 billion fixed coupon 2025 bonds acquired following the liquidation of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation were disposed of since that date; why these amounts are higher than the amounts projected by him; what the revised future schedule of disposals will be at this point; what benefit or disadvantage has accrued to the State as a result of this changed policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1202","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":67,"content":"<p>Subsequent to the liquidation of IBRC the Central Bank acquired &euro;25.034bn of Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) and &euro;3.46bn of the fixed rate 5.4% Treasury Bond 2025.<\/p><p>The table below sets out the details in respect of each of these\u00a0bonds\u00a0and their nominal amounts at year-end 2015.

When one takes into account that property price inflation was over 16 percent in late 2014, this figure represents a significant moderation in price growth. As regards rents, the Private Residential Tenancies Board report that rents nationally increased by 8.6 per cent on an annual basis in the third quarter of 2015.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Recent price and rent developments are primarily the result of a shortage in the supply of accommodation particularly in Dublin and to some extent in the other major cities. As the economy continues to recover there has been significant growth in the number of people at work which has led to increased demand for housing. While there is evidence of a pick-up in building activity, it has not yet reached the level necessary to match demand.<\/p>  <p>  To improve housing supply, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government\u00a0and I recently announced the Stabilising Rents and Boosting Supply package which was agreed by Government. This package is designed to provide greater stability in the rental market in the short run and support sustainable growth in the housing market. This package builds on the Construction 2020 and Social Housing strategies\u00a0and is also complemented by the plans of NAMA to fund the construction of\u00a020,000 units by 2020.

In fact, property ownership is well distributed across the income distribution as is clear in the CSO's Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2013. In terms of the private rental market, this is made up of a large proportion of small landlords. However, there is a clear need to professionalise the private rental sector in order to better serve tenants. To help address this issue, the REIT tax regime was introduced in the Finance Act 2013 to attract large scale investment. <\/p>  <p>  In summary, I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the housing market, including their implications for macroeconomic performance and stability. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA07800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Real Estate Investment Trusts","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA07900"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[1338\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400053#WRA08000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has analysed the impact of real estate investment trusts on the Irish rental market and on property portfolios; if so, if he will provide details; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>The Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) framework was intodcued in Finance Act 2013.\u00a0Its function is to facilitate collective investment in rental property by removing a double layer of taxation which would otherwise apply to property investment via a corporate vehicle.

More people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  In this context, the duration for which an average pension will be paid will continue to increase.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  It was estimated at the time that the net saving resulting from its abolition, when taking into account that many people would instead be in receipt of other payments at the lower rates applicable to those under 66, would amount to &euro;33.5m in 2014 and approximately &euro;65 million in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no general retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  Where a jobseeker's benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year). <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce legislation to change from the current position. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400055#WRC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Conservation Grant Data","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400055#WRC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[1725\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400055#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the administrative costs incurred in 2015 of implementing the water conservation grant; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>The Department of Social Protection is administering the Water Conservation Grant on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government.

The report does not specify the methodology used to calculate this figure, however I would note that the figures differ from estimates by the Revenue Commissioners in response to PQ number 51 of 13 October 2015, indicating that replacement of the income tax structure (including the Universal Social Charge) with a flat rate of 23% on all incomes and removing all tax credits would result in an increase in yield in the order of approximately &euro;672 million in a full year. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the introduction of a flat tax of this nature, with no tax credits or basic allowances, would result in significant tax increases for lower income earners.\u00a0 The report also notes that a flat tax system would normally incorporate an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for all income earners, in order to protect those on lower incomes, and suggests that a growth-driven flat tax system would include an EITC.\u00a0 The report estimates that a break even Exchequer yield for a flat tax system incorporating a graduated EITC would be up to 29%.\u00a0 In this context, it is worth noting that the average effective tax rate for the highest 10% of income earners under the current tax system is approximately 31% (calculated by the Revenue Commissioners, based on estimates for 2016, using the actual data for the year 2013 (the latest year for which data are available) adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim).<\/p>  <p>  The report further posits that the increase in net incomes for higher earners could have consequential increases in exchequer revenues of &euro;493.5 million per annum, through economic growth associated with attracting high net worth individuals to remain in, or relocate to, Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I have said on many occasions that individuals\u00a0in Ireland start to pay the higher\u00a0rate of tax at too low an income level, and that I would seek to address this issue when the public finances would allow me to do so.\u00a0 The changes I introduced the last two Budgets have begun the process of reducing the burden of income taxes for all taxpayers, not just those on higher incomes.\u00a0 Furthermore, Budgets 2015 and 2016 have reduced the top tax rate on incomes of up to &euro;70,044 from 52% to 49.5%, so in 2016 this\u00a0rate has now fallen below 50% for the first time since supplementary Budget in 2009.\u00a0 This will help to support consumer confidence, particularly for middle income earners who have borne the greater share of the cost of the economic downturn, and help to stimulate economic growth.\u00a0 I have also stated my belief that the top rate of tax on all income should not exceed 50%, and that I would continue to work towards this objective in future Budgets, subject to being returned to Government in the next election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400059#WRG01200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":257,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400059#WRG01250"},{"type":"question","counter":258,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[1724\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400059#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied with the operation of legislation to provide protection to persons whose mortgages are sold to third parties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":259,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[1731\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400059#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of firms which are regulated under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":260,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 101 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.

The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'. \u00a0Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'. This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p>The Central Bank is the competent authority in Ireland for the purposes of the Act.

This comes on the back of an\u00a0increase of 6.8 per cent in the second quarter and 7.3\u00a0per cent in the first\u00a0quarter. As a result, GDP per capita is now above its pre-crisis peak. In Budget 2016, published in October 2015,\u00a0my Department forecast that\u00a0the economy would\u00a0grow by 6.2 per cent in 2015\u00a0and\u00a04.3 per cent in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the recovery is now being felt in the domestic economy with consumption up almost 3.5\u00a0per cent in the first three quarters\u00a0of 2015\u00a0and investment up over 25 per cent. In fact, based on\u00a0latest available information\u00a0in 2015\u00a0domestic demand made its strongest positive contribution to economic growth since the crisis began. This is very important as the domestic sectors are both jobs-rich and tax-rich. The external sector is also showing continuing signs of growth with exports increasing by over 13\u00a0per cent\u00a0in the first nine months of\u00a02015.<\/p>  <p>  The economic recovery is also clearly evident in the labour market where we have now had thirteen\u00a0successive quarters of solid annual employment growth. As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by over 6 percentage points since its peak in early 2012.<\/p>  <p>  Over the medium term, my Department expects that\u00a0the economy can\u00a0grow by around 3\u00a0per cent per annum on a sustainable basis. However, achieving a sustained economic recovery cannot be taken for granted and is contingent upon a number of factors including sustainable public finances, maintaining our competitiveness position and ensuring inflationary pressures remain in check over the medium term. <\/p>  <p>  Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years.\u00a0The European Commission in its autumn\u00a0forecasts estimated\u00a0that relative\u00a0unit labour costs in Ireland declined\u00a0by 0.8 per cent annually\u00a0in 2015. This is one of the largest declines across all EU Member States.\u00a0Competitiveness gains have been achieved through productivity improvements. In fact, according to Commission forecasts, Ireland experienced the fastest productivity growth in the EU in 2015.\u00a0It is vitally important that this competitiveness is\u00a0preserved and continues to support growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400060#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU-IMF Programme of Support","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400060#WRH01800"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[1805\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400060#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which he has, over the past five years, amended the agreement reached with the troika, resulting in savings to the economy and to taxpayers, including the extent of such savings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>There have been a number of improvements to the terms of our EU-IMF Programme loans since they were initially agreed in late 2010. These changes have included reductions of the interest rates and, in the case of the EU facilities, extensions of maturities. While not part of the EU-IMF Programme we have also negotiated the replacement of the Promissory Notes issued to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. In addition, we made an early repayment of\u00a0the vast bulk\u00a0of Ireland's IMF programme loans which resulted in considerable savings.<\/p>  <p>  The savings arising from these measures are set out as follows:<\/p>  <p>  When the programme was initially agreed in late 2010, the average interest rate on the &euro;67.5 billion available to draw down from the external sources was estimated by the EU Commission to be 5.82% on the basis of market rates at that time. The average life of the borrowing was initially set at 7.5 years. <\/p>  <p>  In July 2011, the Euro Area Heads of State or Government (HOSG) agreed to reduce the cost of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) loans, and similar reductions were subsequently agreed for the interest rates on the loans provided by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and also by the three bilateral lenders (UK, Sweden and Denmark).\u00a0 It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7&frac12; year term of these loans.\u00a0\u00a0The average maturity of the EFSM and the EFSF loans was extended to a planned 12.5 and 15 years respectively.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In April 2013, EU Finance Ministers agreed in principle to further extend the maximum weighted average maturities on our EFSF and EFSM loans by up to 7 years, over and above the extension agreed in 2011. This further maturity extension removes a refinancing requirement of some &euro;20 billion for the Irish State in the years 2015 to 2022.\u00a0\u00a0 This extension of maturities has a number of significant benefits for Ireland, including smoothing our redemption profile, improving long term debt sustainability and it also has a positive impact on the cost of Exchequer borrowing through creating further downward pressure on our borrowing costs.\u00a0 As of end-December 2015 the euro equivalent cost of our EU IMF programme loans is estimated by the NTMA to have been 2.2%.<\/p>  <p>  While not part of the EU-IMF Programme, it is also worth mentioning that in February 2013, the Irish Government replaced the Promissory Notes issued to IBRC with a series of longer term, non-amortising floating rate Government bonds. This has resulted in significant benefits to the State, including increasing the weighted average life from c.7-8 years for the Promissory Notes to c.34-35 years for the floating rate notes.<\/p>  <p>  The early\u00a0repayment of some 81 per cent of IMF loans, which was completed in Quarter 1 of\u00a0last year, will generate further interest savings, estimated at over &euro;1.5 billion, over the original lifetime of these loans. The current interest rate on the residual IMF loan balance is just 1.05 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), will always seek to avail of any opportunity for savings on the cost of our EU-IMF programme loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400060#WRH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":290,"content":"<p>Question No. 108 answered with Question No. 106.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax and Social Welfare Codes","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400060#WRH02200"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[1809\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400060#WRH02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which the burden of extra taxation imposed on Irish taxpayers at the height of the economic downturn will be modified in future years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>In order to maintain\u00a0the public finances on\u00a0a sustainable footing, around &euro;30 billion of consolidation measures, of which &euro;11 billion were revenue measures, were implemented over a seven year period. <\/p>  <p>  The policies successfully implemented by this Government have seen the restoration of a strongly growing economy and this has been reflected in both our improved fiscal position and strengthening labour market.<\/p>  <p>  To underpin this recovery, to make it more attractive to return to work, to stay in work and to ensure work rewards individuals adequately, the Statement of Priorities issued by Government in July 2014, included a commitment for an income tax reform plan to be delivered over a number of budgets. This undertook to reduce the marginal tax rate on low and middle-income earners, in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system. The first stage of the plan was given effect in Budget 2015, when a suite of Income Tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) measures were introduced.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The measures announced in Budget 2015 were the first steps to reducing the burden placed on Irish taxpayers, particularly for middle-income earners who have borne the greater share of the cost of the economic downturn, and this process continued in Budget 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, I reduced the top rate of income tax from 41% to 40% and extended the standard rate band on which income tax is chargeable at the lower 20% rate by &euro;1,000.

Section 149 does not cover interest rates rather it applies to fees and commissions only.

However, for all loans I would encourage prospective borrowers to shop around for the best deal available. In this regard the Competition and Consumer Protection (CCPC) website, has very useful information for borrowers.<\/p><p>With regard to mortgage interest rates, I would like to confirm to the Deputy that the lending institutions in Ireland - including those in which the State has a shareholding - are independent commercial entities. I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions passing on the European Central Bank interest rate change or in relation to the mortgage interest rates charged.<\/p><p>The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.\u00a0 This interest rate is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding. <\/p><p>Last May, I requested a\u00a0report from the Central Bank on the topic which was subsequently published. The Report on the Influences of Standard Variable Rate\u00a0Mortgage Pricing is available here: . It stated that the spread between official ECB interest rates and the standard variable mortgage rate is relatively high in Ireland, both by historical standards and compared to European peers. However, three factors are important determinants of this margin, namely\u00a0increased credit risk resulting from high levels of non-performing loans and lengthy and uncertain processes of collateral recovery, weak competition, and the constraints on bank profitability arising from legacy issues of the financial crisis, such as an increased regulatory requirement for capital.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, I have taken steps to ensure that the banks provide\u00a0options for mortgage holders to reduce their monthly repayments. I\u00a0met with the six main mortgage lenders in May and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high.\u00a0The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>In September\u00a0I concluded a series of\u00a0follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that\u00a0the majority have put options in place to allow many borrowers reduce their repayments. These options\u00a0range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan-to-value and reductions in fixed rates. I therefore encourage borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their circumstances or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory. In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website www.consumerhelp.ie which I referred to\u00a0earlier is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions. In addition, the CCPC are currently running a mortgage switching campaign and have a mortgage switching tool on their website which should allow borrowers compare rates charged across institutions.\u00a0 I also note that some lenders offer repayment of legal fees or cash incentives to borrowers switching mortgage provider.<\/p><p>I asked the banks to provide options by which borrowers could reduce their monthly repayments and I believe options have been put in place. Furthermore, I am pleased to see that new initiatives and reductions continue to take place. As recently as last week one bank introduced a 0.5% reduction on managed variable rates for new or switcher mortgages with a loan to value of 80% or less. Another bank reduced its SVR\u00a0in December.\u00a0These initiatives illustrate the increasing competitive dynamics in the market. <\/p><p>I note that the Central Bank's statistical release of 11th December 2015 stated that\u00a0mortgage interest rates generally declined during the third quarter of 2015. Variable Principal Dwelling House (PDH) rates declined by 17 basis points over the second quarter\u00a0with corresponding Buy-to-Let (BTL) rates falling by 14 basis points during the same period. <\/p><p>The most recent statistics are available : .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400061#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treasury Management Agency Remuneration","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400061#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[1820\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016011400061#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of staff at the National Treasury Management Agency, excluding the National Asset Management Agency, who received pay in 2015, including retention payments and other benefits, of &euro;100,000 to &euro;150,000, &euro;150,001 to &euro;200,00, &euro;200,001 to &euro;250,000, &euro;250,001 to &euro;300,000, &euro;300,001 to &euro;350,000, &euro;350,001 to &euro;400,000 and in excess of &euro;400,000; the number employed by the National Treasury Management Agency at the end of 2014 and at the end of 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>The table below shows the number of NTMA staff (excluding those assigned to NAMA) by relevant band.\u00a0\u00a0The table shows the number of staff falling within the bands on the basis of their base\u00a0salary and\/or their total\u00a0remuneration.

Funding for this scheme has regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management. Further details on this scheme including eligibility criteria are available on the OPW website, www.opw.ie<\/p>  <p>  The core strategy for addressing areas at potentially significant risk from flooding, is the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. 300 locations nationwide are being assessed under the Programme the purpose of which is to implement the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the River Erne system, Cavan Town is an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) being assessed as part of the North Western\/Neagh Bann CFRAM Study. No other areas of the River Erne system were designated at being potentially significant risk. Those parts of Erne system which affect Cavan Town have been modelled and mapped and are being assessed for preliminary options to address assessed flood risk. Drainage works are part of the suite of measures that are being assessed. A Public Consultation Day was held in Cavan Town on the draft flood mapping on 19th February, 2015 and a further event will be held locally in the coming months on the preliminary options.  Discussions are ongoing with the Rivers Agency of Northern Ireland in relation to any flood risk issues within the Erne system in Co Fermanagh and catchment wide preliminary options will be available at the upcoming public consultation for discussion. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Dromore River system, Ballybay is an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) being assessed as part of the same CFRAM Study.

Following finalisation of the mapping and the identification of preliminary flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific feasible measures to address significant flood risks identified.

The Bill is now outdated and needs to be comprehensively reviewed, particularly in the light of the changed public finances since it was presented.<\/p>  <p>  In order to progress this important legislation, last year I instigated a comprehensive review of the 2007 Bill:<\/p>  <p>- to identify how best to deliver an integrated, reformed structure that will support coroners more effectively, within the Government&rsquo;s current financial possibilities;<\/p>  <p>- to bring the 2007 Bill up to date for legal and forensic developments, and in particular to ensure full compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights; and<\/p>  <p>- to put in place improved support to ensure that bereaved families receive a prompt, responsive, and effective service &ndash; recognising that coroners already strive to do so within the constraints of the existing administrative framework.<\/p>  <p>  Minister of State Simon Harris T.D. has already presented my views on these issues to the Dail on 11th December in the debate on the Private Member's Bill, which the Government decided not to oppose.

I believe that bereaved families in this situation are entitled to a prompt, transparent and sensitive response to their questions and concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The Coroners Bill 2007 already proposed a legal requirement to report any maternal death to a coroner.

A panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel was established for that purpose.<\/p>  <p>  The Panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to them and has therefore largely concluded its work.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June. To date, 307 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases. Letters will continue to issue to all complainants, until the process is completed which I expect will be very shortly as we are nearing the end of the process.  The outcome of the review in this complainant's case issued last month.<\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly emphasised that the Independent Review Mechanism was not established to act as a Commission of Inquiry or Investigation.  Nor was it designed to make findings. Its purpose was to triage the allegations to see whether further action was needed and what that action would be.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to stress the independence of this process.  The cases have all been considered by independent barristers, members of the Panel constituted to conduct this review.  Following their reviews of the papers in each complaint, counsel made recommendations to me, as to whether or not further action should be carried out by me, and if so the nature of that action.  I also appointed a retired judge, Mr Justice Roderick Murphy, to advise on the preparation of letters notifying individuals as to the outcome of the review in their particular cases.  I was concerned that these letters should not only set out the recommendation of counsel, but also outline as far as possible the reasons for the recommendation, subject to any legal constraints there may be.  I made this appointment in order to provide complete reassurance on the probity and independence of this entire process, from start to finish.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation has been recommended by the review then that will occur.  However, I have also pointed out that in a large proportion of cases, counsel would be likely to recommend that no further action could reasonably be taken.  This has proven to be the case.

Sentences dated July 2013, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1204","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":497,"content":"<p>The position in relation to the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission Report on Mandatory Sentences is summarised in a tabular form below.  However, I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group which was tasked with carrying out a strategic review of penal policy.  That report, which I published in September 2014, made a number of recommendations about sentencing. Adopting an approach similar to the LRC in its Report, the Review Group recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences be introduced and existing provisions should be reviewed.  At the time of publication of the report I pointed out that it was my preference to maintain the minimum mandatory life sentence for murder as was also recommended by the LRC. The recommendations of the Review Group, and the LRC, about sentencing are still under consideration within my Department.<\/p><p>More generally, and as the Deputy will appreciate, judges are independent in the matter of sentencing, as in other matters concerning the exercise of judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The approach of the Oireachtas has generally been to specify in law a maximum penalty for an offence, so that a court, having considered all the circumstances of a case, may impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum.  The court is required to impose a sentence which is proportionate not only to the crime but to the individual offender, in that process identifying where on the sentencing range the particular case should lie and then applying any mitigating factors which may be present.  An important safeguard rests in the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply to the Court of Appeal to review a sentence she regards as unduly lenient. <\/p><p>The Superior Courts have developed a substantial body of case law setting out general principles of sentencing.  Sentencing practice is also being developed by a steering committee of the judiciary which developed the Irish Sentencing Information System website, a pilot initiative designed to gather information about the range of sentences and other penalties that have been imposed for particular types of offences across court jurisdictions.  This system is being developed as a valuable tool not only for members of the judiciary but also for lawyers, researchers and those concerned with the needs of victims and their families, and I very much support the initiative led by the Judiciary through the Judicial Research Office in undertaking the detailed work of gathering and providing information on sentencing via the website.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that in 2014, the Court of Criminal Appeal issued a number of judgments which addressed the question of sentencing and which acknowledged the many factors that can be considered in individual cases which undermine the usefulness of direct comparisons between one case and another.  Nonetheless, every effort to promote consistency should be made and in this respect it is appropriate for the courts to provide guidance on sentencing matters.<\/p><p><b><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">REPORT ON MANDATORY SENTENCES (LRC 108-2013)- <\/font><\/b><b>CHAPTER 6 SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS<\/b><table><tr><th>6.01 <\/th><th>The recommendations made by the Commission in this Report are as follows: <\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>6.02 <\/td><td>The Commission supports the recommendations made in 2000, and reiterated in 2011, that a Judicial Council be empowered to develop and publish suitable guidance or guidelines on sentencing, which would reflect the general aims of criminal sanctions and the principles of sentencing discussed in this Report. The Commission also recommends that such guidance or guidelines should have regard to: (i) the sentencing guidance and guidelines available from decisions of the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal (including those discussed in this Report); (ii) the aggravating and mitigating factors, and individual offender characteristics, identified in the Commission&rsquo;s 1996 Report on Sentencing and developed by the courts since 1996; and (iii) information in relevant databases including, in particular, the Irish Sentencing Information System (ISIS). [paragraph 1.128] <\/td><td>A Judicial Council Bill is in the course of preparation which will, inter alia, provide for the establishment of a Judicial Studies Committee.  In its present form, the Bill envisages that this Committee would have the function of disseminating information on the sentencing of persons convicted of criminal offences<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6.03 <\/td><td>The Commission, by a majority, recommends that the mandatory life sentence for murder be retained. [paragraph 3.76] <\/td><td>No specific action is necessary to give effect to this recommendation<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6.04 <\/td><td>The Commission recommends that where an offender is convicted of murder, and is therefore sentenced to life imprisonment, legislation should provide that the judge may recommend a minimum term to be served by the offender. [paragraph 3.84] <\/td><td>This recommendation is currently under consideration in my Department<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6.05 <\/td><td>The Commission recommends that the Parole Board be established on an independent statutory basis, and welcomes the Government&rsquo;s proposal to introduce legislation bringing about this effect. [paragraph 3.86] <\/td><td>Consideration of measures required to place the Parole Board on a statutory footing is underway<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6.06 <\/td><td>The Commission recommends that the following be repealed: (i) the presumptive minimum sentencing regime applicable to drugs offences under section 27(3C) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, and (ii) the presumptive minimum sentencing regime applicable to firearms offences under section 15 of the Firearms Act 1925; section 26, section 27, section 27A and section 27B of the Firearms Act 1964; and section 12A of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990. The Commission also recommends that the use of presumptive minimum sentencing regimes should not be extended to other offences. [paragraph 4.238]<\/td><td>The recommendations about sentencing are still under consideration within my Department<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6.07 <\/td><td>The Commission also recommends that a more structured, guidance-based sentencing system (as envisaged in the recommendations made in Chapter 1) would provide an appropriate alternative to these provisions. In the context of drug-related crime, the Commission also considers that law enforcement efforts may be beneficially supplemented by other initiatives, such as those highlighted in the research conducted by the Health Research Board and the Misuse of Drugs work sector of the British-Irish Council. [paragraph 4.239] <\/td><td>See main body of reply given above<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6.08 <\/td><td>The Commission recommends that the following be repealed: (i) the presumptive sentencing regime applicable to serious repeat offences under section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007; (ii) the mandatory minimum sentencing regime applicable to repeat drug offences under section 27(3F) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977; and (iii) the mandatory minimum sentencing regime applicable to repeat firearms offences under section 15(8) of the Firearms Act 1925; section 26(8), section 27(8), section 27A(8), and section 27B(8) of the Firearms Act 1964; and section 12A(13) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990.

The House will appreciate that at any given time there will inevitably be a significant number of warrants outstanding as indicated by the fact that the House was informed in May 2010 that at the time 37,394 bench warrants were recorded as unexecuted.  The attached table shows the number of bench warrants outstanding in each Garda Division on 25 November, 2015.  I am further informed that is not possible to identify the number of unexecuted warrants as they relate to the years 2011 to 2014.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, difficulties in relation to the execution of warrants are a long standing issue for many police forces around the world,  notably relating to persons actively seeking to evade detection and the limited identification information which might be available to support enforcement.  These difficulties are compounded where the warrant has been outstanding for some years, as is often the case.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na gives priority to the execution of warrants relating to serious crimes.  A welcome analysis of this issue was provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in their report on Crime Investigation of November 2014.  The Inspectorate Report acknowledges the difficulties often faced by Garda&iacute; in pursuing the execution of warrants but it also points to deficiencies in the current systems, some of which are tied to the available technology for recording and monitoring information on warrants.  In this regard the Government is providing a very important investment in new Garda technology under the Capital Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021, amounting to &euro;205m over the life of the Plan, with a view to modernising Garda information systems to support policing services.<\/p><p>In addition, as part of the overall strategic transformation programme underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a Warrants Review Group has been working on means of better managing and enforcing warrants taking on board the Inspectorate&rsquo;s analysis.  A number of improvements have been put in place, including greater use of clerical support staff which helps to free up Garda&iacute; to concentrate on the execution as opposed to the administration of warrants.  I am further advised that warrants enforcement is a recurring agenda item at Garda Senior Management Meetings, as well as regional performance and accountability meetings, to ensure that the situation is continually monitored. <\/p><p><b>Bench warrants awaiting execution in each Garda Division on 25 November 2015<\/b><table><tr><th>Region<\/th><th>Division<\/th><th>Bench Warrants<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin Region<\/td><td>D.M.R.

As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into one of four categories, as follows:<\/p><p><b>-  <\/b>Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;<\/p><p><b>-  <\/b>Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;<\/p><p><b>-  <\/b>Category three,\u00a0where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and<\/p><p><b>-  <\/b>Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious public safety issues for residents.<\/p><p>Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.

An exemption from the Local Property Tax applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.
