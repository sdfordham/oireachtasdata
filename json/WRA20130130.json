Following on from discussions between my Department and all relevant stakeholders, it was agreed that this commitment would be best met by the designation and delivery of an <i>International Week of Irish Culture, <\/i>  based around the St Patrick's Day Festival.  This would allow for the cultivation and development of the solid foundations already in place to showcase to the world Ireland's rich and varied cultural heritage and to promote Ireland as a destination for cultural tourists.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">2012 was essentially the first year of a 5-year development plan for this initiative, which will ultimately potentially link with 2016 commemorations.  Last year, the emphasis was on the international launch of the &quot;<\/font><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">International Celebration of Irish Culture<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&quot; brand abroad and a series of programme activities based in existing cultural venues around the Merrion Square\/Kildare Street areas of Dublin, marketing the message of &quot;<\/font><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I Love my City<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&quot;.  The existing St. Patrick's Festival activity was used to promote Ireland and its culture, both domestically and internationally, and the initiative was well received and supported in both national and international spheres.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Plans for the 2013 event are almost finalised and both the duration and programme have been expanded for this year's event, having particular regard to the Gathering.  In addition to profiling the range of rich cultural events taking place during St. Patrick's Festival, the 2013 programme also includes some 16 headline events in collaboration with various cultural institutions and partners over a 4 day period from the 14<\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">th to the 17<\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">th March inclusive.  These events will be staged in the beautiful surroundings of some of our most prestigious cultural institutions and venues and admission will be free of charge.  Ireland's current presidency of the EU will also be celebrated during the 2013 event, with the key focus of the international element of this year's programme centring on &quot;<\/font><i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Culture Connects&quot;<\/font><\/i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">, the international culture programme of Ireland's EU Presidency.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  <\/font>In further recognition of the Culture Night commitment in the<i> Programme for Government<\/i>, my Department continues to work with all relevant stakeholders to foster and develop the event. Culture Night has grown from a relatively small-scale cultural event staged only in Dublin in 2006 to the significant national cultural event it now is, with Culture Night 2012 featuring a record 34 participating locations, including 6 regions in Northern Ireland, and encompassing over 900 venues, making it the biggest and most extensive Culture Night to date.  Discussions have already commenced with key stakeholders in relation to Culture Night 2013. As it enters its 8th year, the challenge is to keep Culture Night fresh and exciting, whilst building on the platforms and success of previous years to further develop and enhance the event.  Whilst we want people to really enjoy Culture Night, we also want to use it as a stepping stone or bridge to encourage more people to visit cultural venues and experience culture in their locality.  I anticipate that both the Culture Night and <i>International Celebration of Irish Culture<\/i>  initiatives will make a significant contribution towards the success of The Gathering in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000054#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Question No. 10 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Council Funding","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000054#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[4259\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000054#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will consider seeking the implementation of a multi-annual funding framework for those funded through the Arts Council to provide more certainty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>Government policy on the arts, as set out in the <i>Programme for Government<\/i> , is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, and maximise the potential for cultural tourism and job creation in this sector.  In the context of the 2013 Estimates, I continued my endeavours to maximise ongoing Government support for the arts and culture sector. For 2013, the Exchequer allocation to the Arts Council, which is the principal agency through which State funding is channelled to the arts, will total some &#8364;60.7 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding. I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for the arts sector.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and neither I nor my Department has a role to play in its funding decisions. I am advised, however, that the Arts Council operates funding cycles for its three main grant programmes - <i>Regularly Funded Organisations<\/i>; <i>Annual Funding<\/i>; and <i>Annual Programming Grants<\/i>   &#8211; in such a way as to help arts organisations by giving them more funding certainty and improved ability for planning.<\/p><p><br \/>  I believe that within the current economic constraints, our investment in the arts, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever due to the employment intensity of the sector.

The arts continue to underpin policies in attracting foreign direct investment, the creation of an imaginative labour force, establishing an innovative environment in which the creative and cultural industries can thrive, and promoting cultural tourism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000054#WRA00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000054#WRA00850"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[4498\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000054#WRA00900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when a decision will be made in relation to the battlefield site on Moore Street, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1102","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":14,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[4261\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000054#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he intends honouring his undertaking to preserve the 1916 National Monument in its entirety under preservation order No. 1 of 2007.","asker":"1005","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[4511\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000054#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he has received the environmental impact assessment of numbers 14 to 17 Moore Street, Dublin; the result of this assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 18 and 38 together. <\/p><p>  Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street are the subject of a Preservation Order under the National Monuments Acts.

That reply acknowledged the importance of genealogy in the context of The Gathering, especially in terms of helping members of the Irish Diaspora to establish links with their family history and place. My Department, the National Library and the National Archives are concentrating on progressing improvements to our genealogical offering as part of our contribution to The Gathering.<\/p><p><br \/>  Art in all its forms is an intrinsic part of Irish culture and will play an important part in The Gathering.  As outlined on 28 November last, our national cultural institutions such as the National Museum and the National Gallery are promoting a number of initiatives to contribute towards The Gathering.  In addition, the National Concert Hall is focusing on two periods in relation to The Gathering: St Patrick's Weekend and <i>Summer at the NCH, <\/i>where a wide range of concerts featuring leading Irish artists in traditional, popular and classical music will be held throughout July and August.  The National Library's award-winning multimedia exhibition on WB Yeats will run throughout the year. It is also mounting an exhibition to mark the 50th anniversary of the homecoming visit of President John F Kennedy to Ireland in 1963, in partnership with the National Archives, with the support of my own Department, the US Embassy and the JFK Library. It will also host the travelling exhibition &quot;The Fifth Province: Irish County Societies in America&quot;, originally presented in Glucksman Ireland House, New York.  The National Archives will also be playing its part.<\/p><p><br \/>  As outlined previously, the Arts Council is playing an ongoing key role in funding and developing arts events around the country during 2013.

The <i>Creative Europe<\/i> proposal is very important for artists and arts organisations across the entire European Union. It is vital that we get agreement on this so that those working in the culture and creative sectors can benefit from the new programme as soon as possible. It should be noted, however, that agreement on the Multi-Annual Financial Framework is essential to ensure that the <i>Creative Europe<\/i> programme is adopted in time for the sectors to start to benefit from it from the beginning of 2014. The Irish Presidency also considers that <i>Europe for Citizens<\/i> is an important proposal for progression. This proposal seeks to enhance civic participation at the Union level. A further key element of our Presidency is the timely adoption of the <i>European Capitals of Culture <\/i>  proposal so that the chosen locations can be afforded the necessary lead-in times to bring forward preparations for their period of designation.<\/p><p><br \/>  I would also like to refer to Ireland's Cultural Programme for the Presidency - <i>Culture Connects -<\/i> which I launched recently in Dublin with Minister of State Creighton. The Programme aims to showcase Irish culture across Europe, as well as European culture in Ireland, thereby illustrating the shared nature of much of our cultural experiences. The Programme incorporates over 300 projects being undertaken under the management and oversight of my Department - at home and abroad.  It will facilitate the engagement of audiences throughout Ireland with European artists, as well as exposing our indigenous artistic community to wider cultural experiences across Europe and further afield, by way of a range of festivals, traditional arts and other specific events. The <i>Culture Connects<\/i> programme is available on my Department's website and I have also made arrangements to lodge copies in the Oireachtas Library. The EU is culturally diverse, with a rich, shared, European heritage. I firmly believe that it benefits us all to bring our arts and culture to a wider EU audience, whilst also experiencing the cultural offerings of our partner countries.<\/p><p><br \/>  From the heritage perspective, certain nature conservation issues which come into my area of responsibility will fall to be dealt with under the Environment Council formation.  The first of these is an EU Commission proposal in respect of <i>Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization<\/i>. This is intended to meet the requirements of the Nagoya Protocol within the EU and sets out obligations for users of genetic resources in the Union. The Protocol is aimed at ensuring that there is a reward to countries that are the source of biological materials which may be collected for use in other countries in new and profitable products, such as foods, medicines, or biotech agents. It would protect developing countries from so-called &quot;biopiracy&quot; and is also a key step in meeting the 2020 Global Targets on Biodiversity. Ireland's Presidency aims to make significant progress within the Council with regard to the overall objective of EU ratification of the Nagoya Protocol in early 2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  A new Directive on Invasive Alien Species is expected to be adopted by the Commission in the near future and the Irish Presidency will commence work on this item, if it is adopted.  The Irish Presidency also co-ordinated EU positions for the first plenary meeting of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which took place last week in Bonn, Germany. This was an important meeting to establish this new international body, which will provide scientific advice on biodiversity issues.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, in relation to heritage matters, the Irish Presidency is currently overseeing the formulation of common positions on the proposals to be discussed at the 16th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Illegal Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, next March.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the Irish language, my Department is a member of the Network to Promote Linguistic Diversity (NPLD), which is a European-wide network working in the field of language policy and planning. During the Irish Presidency of the EU, my colleague, Minister of State McGinley, will launch the NPLD&#8217;s <i>European Roadmap for Linguistic Diversity<\/i> in Brussels.

Funding for touring production within Ireland is provided by the Arts Council, while funding for international touring is provided under my Department's Culture Ireland Programme.<\/p><p><bu>TABLE: Funding to the Abbey Theatre 2008-2012<\/bu><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Funding Type<\/th><th><div>2008<\/div><\/th><th><div>2009<\/div><\/th><th><div>2010<\/div><\/th><th><div>2011<\/div><\/th><th><div>2012<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Arts Council Revenue Grant<\/td><td><div>&#8364;10,000,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;8,350,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;7,250,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;7,100,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;7,100,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Arts Council Touring Grant<\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;68,000<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;58,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Culture Ireland Touring Grant<\/td><td><div>&#8364;49,511<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;26,400<\/div><\/td><td><div><\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;236,348<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;60,204<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht Capital Grant<\/td><td><div>&#8364;297,701<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;196,272<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;467,821<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;249,662<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;450,000<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td><div>&#8364;10,347,212<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;8,572,672<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;7,717,821<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;7,654,010<\/div><\/td><td><div>&#8364;7,668,204<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000055#WRB01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":34,"content":"<p>Question No. 17 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":35,"content":"<p>Question No. 18 answered with Question No. 12.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Premises","counter":36,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000055#WRB02000"},{"type":"question","counter":37,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[4262\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000055#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his plans to take into State ownership the Bank of Ireland building at College Green, Dublin, based on its historical significance; if the issue has been discussed with the owners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[4503\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000055#WRB02200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the position in relation to his effort to secure Bank of Ireland on College Green, Dublin, for the purpose of the Arts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1037","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 48 together.<\/p><p>  I refer the Deputy to my previous replies on this matter.

The Report was published in July 2011 and an implementation committee to pursue the execution of its recommendations has been established.  One of the main recommendations in the Report is the extension of the Section 481 Scheme until the end of 2020; it is currently approved until the end of 2015.<\/p><p><br \/>  A public consultation process to assist the Department of Finance in examining the operation of the Section 481 Scheme beyond 2015 was announced in May 2012.  This consultation process invited interested parties to make submissions on the economic impact assessment of the operation, status and future development of the Section 481 Scheme.  My Department was involved centrally in this consultation.  In his budget speech last December, the Minister for Finance, Mr Michael Noonan, T.D., announced that the Section 481 Scheme will be extended to 2020.  An important and significant change will mean that the scheme will operate as a tax credit model from 2016.  This will allow an extended lead-in period to enable the sector to adapt to the change to a tax credit model.  This very good news has been welcomed by the sector.  The extension of this scheme gives a great deal of certainty to the Irish audiovisual sector to the end of this decade and will help to ensure that current jobs in the sector for indigenous crews and actors are maintained. <\/p><p><br \/>  As the Deputies are aware, primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB).  This agency is funded through my Department and is independent in its day-to-day operations.  As part of its remit, the IFB would have regular meetings with international film makers, as well as attending the major international film festivals to promote Ireland as a location for film making.  I support that effort and, with An Taoiseach, recently met the renowned film director, Mr Stephen Spielberg.<\/p><p><br \/>  The IFB targets for 2013 in terms of audiovisual production activity is for an increase in the value of such activity of over 20 per cent - from &#8364;180m in 2012 to &#8364;220m in 2013.  In tandem with this, the IFB aims to increase employment in the sector from 6,600 full time equivalents (FTEs) to 7,800 (FTEs) &#8211; an increase of 19 per cent.  These are ambitious targets for the audiovisual sector but, combined with the incentives from Section 481, I believe that they can be achieved.<\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, with regard to the growth in the Irish audiovisual sector in the last five years, one simple indicator can be obtained by comparing the number and value of Section 481 (Film Tax Relief Scheme) projects approved between 2008 and 2012.  In 2008, there were 38 projects approved with an Irish spend of &#8364;108m, while, in 2012, there were 52 projects approved with an Irish spend of &#8364;143m - an increase of 36.8% in the number of projects and an increase of 32.4% in the level of Irish spend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":48,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":49,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[4266\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the steps that he is taking to implement the recommendations by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment report on Shannon Flooding published last year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":50,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the recommendations to which he refers cover a number of areas within my Department's remit:<\/p><p>- Waterways Ireland, which has responsibility for the Shannon Navigation; and <\/p><p>- my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service, which has general responsibility for the implementation of national and EU law under the Wildlife Acts and the Birds and Habitats Directives for the protection of habitats and species.<\/p><p>  I can advise the Deputy that the recommendations of the Report are being comprehensively examined and considered by my Department at present and I envisage that I will be in a position to respond to the Joint Committee shortly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":51,"content":"<p>Question No. 22 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC01050"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[4505\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his plans to commemorate the 1913 Lockout; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1047","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[4499\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he has made a decision regarding a grant application to restore the former Richmond Barracks gymnasium as a local museum and centre for focus on commemorations in 1916; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 39 together.  <\/p><p>  In the development of the commemorative programme, I have been in dialogue with national organisations, military heritage and history societies, local authorities and community groups about their interests and possible contributions in the coming years.  I was impressed by the proposals brought forward by the community group at St Michael's Estate in relation to the surviving buildings from Richmond Barracks.  In the aftermath of the Easter Rising, these buildings were used for the detention of prisoners and the trials of the leaders.  I invited the group to meet with the All-Party Group on Commemorations, which was satisfied to commend the project for any available support.  The centenary commemorative programme does not contain any capital allocation to assist projects and consequently a decision on an application for a grant does not arise at this time.

Of the 2,586 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme received and acknowledged by my Department to date, 766 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.  A total of 2,142 payments and 194 deliveries of turf have been made to date in respect of the applications received. <\/p><p>  Arrangements for the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs have been made as regards a group from Clara Bog in County Offaly and a group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog SACs in County Galway.  These arrangements involve the groups moving to nearby bogs, with the group from Clara Bog having commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June last, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated.  Agreement has been reached between my Department and the group of turf cutters from Carrownagappul and Curraghlehanagh Bogs that necessary infrastructure development works will be carried out this year in the relocation site in preparation for turf cutting. The commencement of cutting depends on the ground settling following these works and I understand that cutting will commence here in 2014.  <\/p><p>  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation in a similar manner of qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog SAC in County Kildare.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in a relocation site during the forthcoming turf cutting season.  In total, 70 applicants from Carrownagappul Bog, 19 applicants from Curraghlehanagh Bog and 28 applicants from Ballynafagh Bog have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog SACs, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 31 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating these. Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 15 raised bog SACs due, for example, to the small number of turf cutters that have been active on these sites.<\/p><p>  The Deputies will appreciate that relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishing the number who can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements. Accordingly, it will only be possible to bring this process to a conclusion over time in respect of all the relocation sites.  It is not possible to indicate, therefore, when exactly additional turf cutters can be accommodated at any of these sites over and above the specific cases already mentioned.<\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of applicants being qualified for relocation, the process of assessing applications is being carried forward by officials in my Department.  Deputies will appreciate that assessment and verification of applications is a complex process.  My officials are continuing to work closely with turf cutters, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (as successors of the Land Commission), Bord na M&oacute;na and other organisations to assist people to provide the necessary proof of legal interest with their applications. <\/p><p>  With regard to persons awaiting payment under previous compensation schemes, I assume that the Question in this regard is referring to applicants from raised bog SACs. Such applicants had been informed that they could, if they wished, transfer from the former voluntary bog purchase scheme to the new compensation scheme established by my Department for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog SACs.  This would, of course allow applicants to retain ownership of their land holding or rights, while availing of compensation.  Over 140 applicants have availed of this option to date and I am advised that of the order of 250 further applications remain under consideration in my Department at this time.<\/p><p>  Overall, given the magnitude of the challenges involved, I am satisfied that the vast majority of active turf cutters are engaging positively with the schemes put in place by the Government to ensure that Ireland meets its obligations to protect these important areas, while ensuring that the needs of turf cutters are met appropriately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fosta&iacute;ocht sa Ghaeltacht","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC01850"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[4456\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000056#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"an bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;sta leis na hiarrachta&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh chun n&iacute;os m&oacute; fosta&iacute;ochta a chur ar f&aacute;il sa Ghaeltacht, an mbeidh comhlacht nua are n&oacute;s LEADER &aacute; bhun&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht","asker":"1040","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>Deirtear i r&aacute;iteas deireadh bliana &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta don bhliain 2012 gur crutha&iacute;odh 700 post nua i gcliantchuideachta&iacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in 2012.

The harbour porpoise is the principal conservation interest of the site, though it also contains small areas of geogenic reef, which are also afforded protection.  Like all species of cetaceaen, the harbour porpoise enjoys strict protection under Article 12 of the Habitats Directive wherever it occurs, whether within or outside a designated area. <\/p><p>  My Department was consulted in advance of the issuing of the consents referred to in the questions.  Advice was provided to both the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Communication, Energy and Natural Resource on the protection of marine mammals, including the harbour porpoise, and on appropriate mitigation measures that should be employed during the survey.  Where a site is proposed for designation as an SAC, consent authorities are required to consider the implications of proposals on the site, in keeping with Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, before consents are granted. However, I understand that the consents referred to were granted before I notified my intention to designate the Rockabill to Dalkey Island SAC.  Any future consent for exploration, extraction or any other activity within or in the vicinity of the SAC will need to be examined for potential impacts upon it. Consent authorities will need to satisfy themselves that proposed projects do not pose a risk to the integrity of this and other sites before issuing such consents.<\/p><p>  In preparing proposals for designation, my Department would normally be in contact informally with relevant bodies as part of the process of preparing formal proposals and in preparing the scientific grounds for proposals. My Department had made known for some time it had planned to designate additional marine sites and this would have been known to the Departments referred to in the Questions. Those Departments are now being consulted on the proposed designation, on a formal basis, in accordance with the regulatory framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000057#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Waterways","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000057#WRD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[4271\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000057#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will provide an update on progress on the Ulster Canal Project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"973","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>In July 2007, the North\/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) agreed to proceed with the restoration of the section of the Ulster Canal between Clones and Upper Lough Erne. The then Government agreed to cover the full capital costs of the project, which were estimated at that time to be of the order of &euro;35m.  It was always the intention that the Ulster Canal project would be funded from the Waterways Ireland annual allocations, as agreed through the annual estimates processes in this jurisdiction, as well as the deliberations of NSMC in relation to annual budgets. I am advised that it was a key consideration throughout the process that the Ulster Canal project would be supported by a significant level of projected income from the commercialisation of certain Waterways Ireland assets. As the Deputy will be aware, the economic downturn has had a negative impact on those plans. <\/p><p>  Despite this, the Ulster Canal project is progressing incrementally. I continue to explore all possible options that may assist in the advancement of the project and have established an Inter-Agency group in that regard. I attended the first meeting of that group and look forward to the group continuing its work in the period ahead.

I welcome this initiative, which is expected to be one of the biggest tourism events ever to be undertaken in Ireland. It will be a year-long event when people at home and abroad can play a part in the country's recovery, potentially bringing 325,000 visitors to Ireland and providing a major economic stimulus.  <\/p><p>  The Gathering is a hugely important initiative for our tourism sector, one with which my Department, its agencies and the national cultural institutions which operate under its aegis are very pleased to support and participate in. In that context, officials from my Department have been working closely with colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and agencies within its remit on cultural, genealogical and heritage tourism matters.  I also see The Gathering as an excellent opportunity to promote our culture, heritage and the traditional arts. Government policy is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts, make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life, and maximise the potential for cultural tourism.  <\/p><p>  A condition in all relevant schemes of support from my Department in 2013 is that of mobilizing support for The Gathering. Primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council, which, under the Arts Acts, is independent in its funding decisions.  While my Department does not have any special arrangements in terms of financial support to be made available for traditional musicians, dancers and artists for the duration of The Gathering, support for artforms is already provided through Exchequer funding to the Arts Council and Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann. <\/p><p>  In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of some &euro;60.7 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding. The Council has many different funding schemes and programmes available to support a wide variety of artistic genre, including specific supports for traditional arts, music and dance.  In addition, my Department will also be allocating funding of almost &euro;1.6 million in 2013 to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann to help support its important work in maintaining, developing and promoting traditional Irish music and culture.

This development has had the welcome effect of greatly increasing the availability and visibility of Irish in the EU institutions. Notwithstanding the status of the language in the EU, there is, however, a derogation in place for practical reasons which states that the EU institutions are not bound by the obligation to translate all legal texts. This stems from the difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of qualified personnel to meet requirements in the EU institutions.<\/p><p><br \/>  The original derogation with regard to the use of Irish in the EU institutions applied for 5 years from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011. This was extended for another 5 years from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2016. Under the terms of the derogation, only EU laws made under the co-decision procedure must be translated into Irish.  The Lisbon Treaty, which came into effect on 1 December 2009, resulted in the co-decision procedure becoming the norm, rather than the exception, for EU law-making. This has resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of EU laws that must be translated into Irish.<\/p><p><br \/>  A decision on whether to extend the derogation for another 5 years must be made by December 2015 at the latest.

Broadly, the reliefs restricted are the various property based tax incentives and certain other reliefs such as the Employment and Investment Incentive, film relief and the artists&rsquo; exemption. The normal deductible items available to the broad range of taxpayers such as medical expenses, personal tax credits and exemptions such as that for child benefit are not restricted.

I will consider these proposals and the level of the rebate in the context of the Finance Bill.  It is worth noting that one of key arguments for introducing a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by this industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.  A rebate should encourage hauliers to start purchasing their fuel in Ireland thus offsetting some of the costs involved. Such an argument does not exist for the most part for the coach industry.  The fuel rebate scheme proposed is governed by the terms of Council Directive 2003\/96\/EC of 27 October 2003 which limits its application to auto diesel used in defined categories of road vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000062#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Treasury Management Agency","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000062#WRJ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[4652\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000062#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if staff at the National Treasury Management Agency received bonuses in 2012; if so, the total of the bonuses paid; and if he will provide in tabular form the individual bonuses paid per type of employee.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":154,"content":"<p>I am advised by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) that the Agency&rsquo;s remuneration review in respect of 2012 is currently being finalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000062#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000062#WRJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[4653\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000062#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of staff in the Shareholder Management Unit in the Department of Finance; and the cost of the SMU in full year 2012 and the budgeted cost in full year 2013.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[4654\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000062#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of staff in the Shareholder Management Unit who are seconded to the SMU from the National Treasury Management Agency and if he will set out in bands of three months the number of secondees and their duration of secondment from the National Treasury Management Agency to the SMU.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[4656\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000062#WRJ01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons working in the Shareholder Management Unit in the Department of Finance who are not employees of the Department of Finance or secondments from the National Treasury Management Agency.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 66 and 68 together.<\/p><p>  The number of staff in the SMU is 25.

In my comments to the media following these meetings I made the point that it would be premature to quote any precise figures for possible savings as the details remain to be worked out, but I noted that this proposal could yield significant savings over time which could be in billions rather than in hundreds of millions of euro. <\/p><p>  As the issue is still under discussion, the details of any extension agreed are not yet known.  The views of all Euro Area and EU Member States, along with those of the EFSF and EFSM, will need to be taken into account.  The savings arising will depend on a number of factors &ndash; the amount of loans for which a maturity extension is agreed, the length of any maturity extension, and the assumption made about the extent to which the EFSF and EFSM borrowings are cheaper than borrowings by Ireland.  As I have already outlined, the level of loans and the length of the maturity remain to be agreed, while the assumption of the interest rate differential is ultimately a matter of judgement.   There is a broad range of possible scenarios in that regard. It is worth noting that at present the differential between 10 year Irish and EFSF and EFSM borrowing costs would be about 2.5%.  I would stress, however, that any scenarios are highly tentative and sensitive to the assumptions concerning the amount of loans covered, the maturity extension granted and the interest differential applied. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000064#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Promissory Notes","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000064#WRL00400"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[4721\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000064#WRL00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide details on the current status of the negotiations with the European Central Bank regarding the promissory notes; the person who is negotiating on Ireland's behalf; the objective of the negotiations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>As the deputies are aware, the Irish Government has been working extremely hard to secure a deal on the Irish bank debt with our European partners and detailed work will continue to ensure that positive moves in Europe are harnessed to maximise the benefit to the Irish taxpayer.

There are now 76 early intervention classes for children with autism attached to mainstream schools that are funded by the Department.

In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my recent reply on this issue (PQ 3066\/13 - answered 23\/01\/13).<\/p><p>  The range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement includes promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards. In this regard the standard template contracts issued by the National Procurement Service (NPS) in 2012 include provisions requiring compliance by the contractor with employment legislation. The standard public works contracts include provisions to ensure that the rates of pay and the conditions of employment, comply with all applicable law and that those rates and conditions are at least as favourable as those for the relevant category of worker in any registered employment agreements.<\/p><p>  The inclusion of a social clause in all public procurement contracts requiring that a quota of long-term unemployed be employed in the delivery of the contract poses a number of risks. In the current economic climate, it would be quite likely that where a business is awarded a public contract, in particular a small-scale contract, the work would be carried out by the existing employees of that business. In such circumstances a social clause requiring that a number of long-term unemployed be employed in delivering a public contract could either impose an additional cost on SMEs that they may not be able to afford, or result in the displacement of existing employees. Challenges also arise from the need to ensure that the benefits are capable of being measured and monitored during the performance of the contract and that additional costs are not placed on local suppliers relative to other potential suppliers.<\/p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting the long term unemployed people.  Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.

The purpose of this Circular is to inform public bodies of the mandatory requirement to utilise central contracts, put in place by the NPS, when procuring a range of commonly acquired goods and services. Such central arrangements are targeted at securing best value for money and facilitating contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.<\/p><p>  The NPS is focused on developing centralised arrangements for the procurement of goods and services used commonly across the public service nationwide. The benefits arising from these central arrangements include: cash savings; administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; greater purchasing expertise; improved consistency and compliance with EU procurement regulations; and enhanced service levels.  Prior to issuing tenders the NPS engages with its clients to ensure their requirements are met and that the most commonly bought items are included in the tender. Under the provision of Circular 06\/12 it is however permissible for buyers to purchase goods and services from non-NPS suppliers if these goods and services are demonstrably cheaper.<\/p><p>  However, where a public service body purchases such goods or services it will need to explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangements and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs incurred in managing its own procurement process.  Systems of internal control within public service bodies are to support compliance with the requirements of the circular. Public service bodies shall make available for review if requested by internal auditors, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Local Government Audit Service or other duly appointed auditors, details of internal controls in place to ensure compliance, and details of goods and services, subject to the mandate, acquired other than under mandated NPS central frameworks and the associated value for money justification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000068#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform Implementation","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000068#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[4797\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000068#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding public servants.","asker":"1017","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>The Public Service Reform Plan was published in November 2011 and sets out the basis for the comprehensive and strategic reform of the Irish Public Service.

Details of the progress being made in line with the Reform Plan can be found in the Progress Report published last September, which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  The Reform Plan is not just about securing the substantial savings we need to make in order to restore the public finances to a sustainable footing; it is also about maximising new and innovative service delivery channels; leading organising and working in new ways; and placing customer service at the heart of everything we do.  If we do not radically reform the way the Public Service is managed and organised, it is the most vulnerable in our society who will suffer the most.<\/p><p>  In order to support our determination to restore order to the public finances and to meet our fiscal targets, the Government have indicated that an additional saving of &euro;1 billion in the pay and pensions bill will be necessary in the period to end 2015.  Any measures aimed at achieving overall savings of &euro;1 billion will involve reductions in payroll costs for serving staff as well as significant productivity and workforce reform measures to support the reform programme, in addition to those already achieved under the current Croke Park Agreement.  The Government is committed to seeking agreement with staff representatives on the measures to be introduced to achieve the necessary savings in the Public Service pay and pensions bill.

I am continuing to work towards this goal with my Department and the agencies in its remit.  The Programme for Government 2011-2016, along with my Department's Statement of Strategy, has the overall goal of promoting and developing Ireland's world-class artistic and creative strengths at home and abroad and of maximising their societal, economic and reputational value for the country. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will know, responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels throughout the country is primarily devolved to the Arts Council. Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations and my Department has no role to play in its executive or funding decisions. The Arts Council is playing an ongoing key role in funding and developing arts events around the country during 2013.

The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative <\/i>  - was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources. The initiative, established with funding of &#8364;230,000 for 2012, has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts. The initiative was available across projects of varying scale, geography and art forms to not-for-profit organisations for arts programming projects. The organisations approved for funding under the initiative were required to procure matching philanthropic funds and complete their drawdown from my Department in 2012. Matched funding could not come from public funds or from any public sector organisation. It was anticipated that a multiple of 3.5 on the pilot initiative funds of &#8364;230,000 will result in philanthropic funding of some &#8364;800,000 being raised for the arts. The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts. I am considering a similar scheme in 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Leverage Initiative was run in parallel with a second initiative - the Arts Council's <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity<\/i>   pilot initiative. This initiative provides one-to-one professional support to eight selected organisations for two years through planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme. This initiative will help those art organisations build and resource their capacity to attract philanthropic giving. In developing this complementary programme, the Arts Council has identified that it is vital for art groups to develop, agree and implement an effective fundraising strategy and to properly resource that fundraising function. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has also provided support to Business to Arts (a not-for-profit organisation working to support resilience and transformation in the cultural sector through research, innovation and partnership) for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland (The Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment in this project is &#8364;400k over three years).<\/p><p><br \/>  In 2010 my Department also awarded a &#8364;20,000 grant under the Cultural Technology Grants Scheme to <i>Business to Arts<\/i> for the &#8216;<i>Fund it<\/i>&#8217; initiative. Business to Arts initially matched this figure with private funding and since then has attracted additional foundation funds to this project. <i>Fund it<\/i> is a new all-island &quot;crowdfunding&quot; website for Ireland&#8217;s creative projects, giving everyone the power to help good ideas happen. '<i>Fund it'<\/i>   is designed to support greater individual giving to the creative sector; the approach serves to strengthen the bond between a creator and their audience which offers the potential for wider-ranging, long-term relationships.  In late 2012 I also hosted a conference on philanthropy and the arts and a number of follow-on actions arose from that event.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000071#WRS00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Projects","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000071#WRS00950"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[4808\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000071#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which he has received any communication indicating heritage sites or buildings deemed to be at risk for whatever reason; the number of sites or locations made known to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[4809\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000071#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which he has received applications for funding for the improvement, renovation, restoration or conservation of buildings, sites or national monuments; the extent to which any such locations are likely to receive attention in the current and future years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together. <\/p><p>  I refer to the replies to Question No. 486 on 6 June 2012, Nos. 201, 202 and 203 on 18 July, 2012 and Nos. 150, 151, 155 and 159 on 28 November 2012 and to the supplementary material sent to the Deputy in recent days in support of the reply to Question No. 151 of 28th November 2012.

The Presidency provides the opportunity to fully engage with the EU agenda and to rebuild Ireland&#8217;s reputation, both in Europe and internationally.  Given our current economic situation, it is also critical that the Presidency is both cost-effective and well-run.  It is widely recognised that an efficient Presidency will generate positive short-term benefits, but will also influence longer-term perceptions about the State and promote goodwill towards Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to the wide-ranging policy agenda that will be addressed during the Presidency, it is the practice for the country holding the Presidency to mount a programme of cultural events.  The presentation of a Cultural Programme offers a unique opportunity to project a strong image of Ireland to audiences within the EU and beyond.  It also offers a platform to engage with people at home concerning Ireland&#8217;s place in the EU and to review, after 40 years of membership, how we see that relationship further developing.<\/p><p><br \/>  Clearly, given the wealth of our historic cultural engagement with Europe and our contemporary artistic strengths, there are a host of different approaches that could be taken to developing the Programme.  In line with the overall approach to Presidency planning, it is critical, however, that the Programme is run as cost-effectively and efficiently as possible, making best uses of the resources available to us, whilst also showcasing the best of Ireland.<\/p><p><br \/>  Key objectives of Ireland's Culture Programme include the following:<\/p><p>- To showcase the strength and diversity of Irish culture and enhance further Ireland&#8217;s reputation for cultural excellence.<\/p><p>- To present a range of Irish events of high quality across a diverse range of art forms to the widest possible audience across the European Union.<\/p><p>- To complement the overall programme for Ireland&#8217;s EU Presidency.<\/p><p>- To programme events across three key locations (Brussels\/Belgium, Paris, Berlin) and each EU Member State.<\/p><p>- To engage with European institutions and culture networks to allow for professional development of Irish artists and cultural institutions.<\/p><p>- To use the EU Presidency Culture Programme as an opportunity to engage with &#8220;third&#8221; countries or key territories outside the European Union.<\/p><p>- To achieve maximum visibility and impact for the Irish cultural sector and Ireland, in general, through a communications and promotion strategy.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland's <i>Culture Connects <\/i>Programme is a wide and varied programme which involves the engagement of Irish artists in Europe and beyond, as well as European artists in Ireland. It is a key element in Ireland's plans to celebrate our Presidency of the EU in the first six months of 2013. For many centuries Ireland has had strong historic cultural connections to Europe and our Presidency offers an opportunity to celebrate and build on those connections. There is a great diversity in the culture of the Member States of the EU but there is also a common thread which runs through our culture and which allows us to understand each other and to work closely together to achieve our wider aims.<\/p><p><br \/>  Through the many events planned across all Member States, Irish artists will present and highlight the unique quality of Irish culture. It is a culture of which we are proud and which has gained us an international reputation for excellence. This programme includes many high profile artists from Beckett, Bacon and Eileen Gray to Anne Enright, Se&aacute;n Scully and Altan. Irish artists will present work in all Member States, with a special focus on Brussels, Paris and Berlin.

Arising from his previous asylum history in Italy, and in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations, a determination was made that the person concerned should be transferred to Italy for the purposes of having his asylum application examined there. Consequently, a Transfer Order was made in respect of the person concerned. This Order was formally served on the person concerned, by letter dated 10th March, 2008, which placed a legal obligation on him to 'present' himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Thursday 13th March,  2008, to make arrangements for his formal transfer to Italy.

I understand that mussel farmers in Cromane have been unable to bring their product to market because of this toxicity event, but the State controls are there to protect public health and indeed the international reputation of Irish seafood thereby ensuring the future of this important sector.  <\/p><p>  While there are no specific funds available for operators affected by these natural occurring events, which are an inevitable occasional feature of operating aquaculture farms in Irish coastal waters, a range of financial support measures co-funded by the European Fisheries Fund are available to the seafood sector through the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WRBB00700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[4715\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding cuts of Health Service Executive funding to the posts of Childminder Advisory Officer in the Wicklow constituency (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>The 1991 Childcare Act provided for regulation of the pre-school sector.  However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.<\/p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.<\/p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.<\/p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.<\/p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.<\/p><p>  In 2007, the then Office of the Minister for Children published National Guidelines for Childminders which had been developed by its National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee.  The Guidelines provide information to childminders on whether they are subject to the Child Care Regulations, the voluntary notification system, the tax relief for childminders, as well as guidance on good practice and other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.<\/p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing this Strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of our Early Years sector, aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from bith to the age of six.  One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the Early Years Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.<\/p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the HSE, and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services, as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder's home.<\/p><p>  Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations.  Decisions on how best to regulate and support the childminding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work on the Early Years Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Adoptions","counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WRBB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":476,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[4566\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the date that has been set for Russian authorities to visit Dublin to conduct bilateral discussions; and if she will confirm the persons that will be attending these talks on behalf of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and from her Department.","asker":"1018","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":477,"content":"<p>As Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention future adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bilateral agreement.

In 2010, the European Commission issued guidance that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards.  This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives.  However, challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract.

The contract also provides that junior doctors shall not be required to work more than 24 consecutive hours on-site.  A related agreement between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation provides that the contract is subject to the requirements of the Directive.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to achieving compliance with the European Working Time Directive in respect of junior doctors by 2014 and I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.  While there has been a significant reduction in the weekly hours worked by junior doctors in recent years, typically they continue to work approximately 55 hours per week.  Further work is therefore required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Directive. <\/p><p>  In January 2012, a detailed plan for the achievement of compliance by junior doctors with the Working Time Directive was submitted to the EU Commission.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing the measures necessary, including: new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by junior doctors to other grades, and the organisation of hospital services to support compliance.  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the junior doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission. The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013. This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance. A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WREE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WREE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":528,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[4712\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WREE00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will investigate the homecare package for a child (details supplied) in Dublin 9.","asker":"1012","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":529,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WREE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services","counter":530,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WREE00850"},{"type":"question","counter":531,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[4713\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000075#WREE00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding dental treatment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin","asker":"1012","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":532,"content":"<p>Dental services to children up to 16 years are provided by the Public Dental Service of the HSE.

The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the largest project within the current Capital Plan.  This Government regards the building of the hospital as a priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.  Following the Government decision on the location, my first priority has been to address the necessary project management structures and governance arrangements to enable the delivery of the capital  project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality.  The scale, complexity and vital importance of this project means we must get this element right now, and I have therefore given this detailed consideration and intend to bring proposals to Government shortly. <\/p><p>  Pending the implementation of revised project management and governance arrangements, work is continuing on the project through the existing mechanisms, including the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.

It is envisaged that there will be an urgent care centre or urgent care centres based on consideration of the geographical distribution of attendances and acuity of the patient. Following the Government's decision to locate the new hospital on the St James's campus, a review is now underway on the location and number of urgent care centres, which is expected to be complete in the coming weeks.  Preliminary work in relation to the site and site preparation is ongoing, and immediate next steps will include the termination of existing contracts, following legal advice, followed by new procurement processes which will be fully compliant with statutory periods. In this regard, I welcome the fact that a significant proportion of the work that was done for the project on the Mater site, including the internal configuration and adjacencies, will be transferable to the new site, although clearly a new design for the new site is required. <\/p><p>  In regard to the timelines, the estimation of the various stages of the project require to be developed, reviewed and validated and, once established, will be kept under scrutiny with strong and proactive project management.

Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously lodged an application for asylum in Italy, on 26th March, 2003.  Arising from his previous asylum history in Italy, and in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations, a determination was made that the person concerned should be transferred to Italy for the purposes of having his asylum application examined there. Consequently, a Transfer Order was made in respect of the person concerned. This Order was formally served on the person concerned, by letter dated 10th March, 2008, which placed a legal obligation on him to 'present' himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Thursday 13th March,  2008, to make arrangements for his formal transfer to Italy. The person concerned failed to 'present' on this occasion and was therefore classified as having 'evaded' his transfer. This position continued to obtain with the consequence that the Transfer Order eventually expired and Ireland then became responsible for examining the asylum claim.<\/p><p>  The asylum claim of the person concerned was examined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. Arising from the formal refusal of his asylum claim, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 14th September, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. He was also notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. <\/p><p>  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.

At that point, all representations submitted by and on behalf of the person concerned, including the information included with the Deputy's Question, will be considered before a final decision is made.

The Marine Institute is responsible for monitoring shellfish for the presence of naturally occurring phytoplankton toxins. Toxicity can occur at any time during the year and the periods of closure can vary considerably from year-to-year. The monitoring programme is designed to detect toxicity in shellfish growing areas before harvesting, thereby providing the necessary information to restrict the placement of toxic shellfish on the market. Regulatory controls, which are enforced by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, exist to support these restrictions. <\/p><p>  Cromane Bay has been on a closed biotoxin status on an almost continuous basis since July 2012 for azaspiracid toxins, with levels of azaspiracids detected occasionally up to 9 times the regulatory limit.

I am aware of the difficulties that these naturally occurring toxicity events cause for shellfish fishermen and aquaculture operators.

However, there was a recognition at the time of the difficulties of regulating the childminding sector, given its scale and the strong view that women should not be subject to regulation if they minded a small number of additional children.  As a result, the majority of childminders are exempt from the Regulations currently in place.<\/p><p>  The 2000 Expert Working Group on Childcare set out a plan for integrating the various strands of child care and education, including childminding.  It made a number of recommendations aimed at overcoming the barriers preventing childminders from moving into the formal economy, most of which have been implemented.  These included the introduction of a system for voluntary notification of childminders, and the introduction of Childcare Services Relief, which allows a voluntarily-notified childminder to mind up to three children without paying tax on the earnings and to make a PRSI contribution.<\/p><p>  In 2002, the Health Service Executive (HSE) agreed to fund a Childminding Advisory Officer post in each county, who would work with the 33 City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) funded under the Childcare Programme, implemented by the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The role included notifying childminders of training opportunities, providing networking opportunities and supporting the voluntary notification system which was being developed by the CCCs.  While Childminding Advisory Officers were established in most county areas, this was not always the case and they were not always located with the local CCC.  Despite their presence and the additional supports including training, a small capital grant scheme and the introduction of a tax relief for childminding in 2006, the increase in the number of voluntarily-notified childminders since 2004, when the number was 500, has been relatively small and levelled off at 1,250.<\/p><p>  In recent years, HSE funding for the Childminding Advisory Officer posts has gradually decreased, and is no longer in place in some areas.  I understand that this is due to pressure on HSE resources and the need to prioritise funding to other areas of front-line services.  While this is not a welcome development, I would point to the fact that the CCCs are now well-established and effective bodies at local level, and that supporting the childminding sector is an integral part of their work.  As a result, childminders continue to have access to support, training and advice.<\/p><p>  My Department provides annual funding to each CCC to enable them to support and advise all childcare providers at local level.  In 2012, the total amount allocated to the CCCs was &euro;11.3m.  In addition, in 2012 my Department provided &euro;220,000 to the CCCs for Childminding Development Grants.  My Department also provides annual funding, totalling &euro;2.85m in 2012, to seven National Voluntary Childcare Organisations to provide support at a local level to their members.  This included &euro;358,000 for Childminding Ireland, the representative body for childminders.<\/p><p>  In 2007, the then Office of the Minister for Children published National Guidelines for Childminders which had been developed by its National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee.  The Guidelines provide information to childminders on whether they are subject to the Child Care Regulations, the voluntary notification system, the tax relief for childminders, as well as guidance on good practice and other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of childcare services.<\/p><p>  My Department has commenced work on Ireland's first Early Years Strategy.  I have received Government approval for the approach I am taking in developing this Strategy as an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of our Early Years sector, aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from bith to the age of six.  One of the policy issues which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the Early Years Strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully-integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.<\/p><p>  Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006, services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the HSE, and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  Services covered by the Regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services, as well as childminders taking care of more than three pre-school children from different families in the childminder's home.<\/p><p>  Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are not covered by the Regulations.  Decisions on how best to regulate and support the childminding sector will continue to form part of the ongoing work on the Early Years Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000080#WRBB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Adoptions","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000080#WRBB00850"},{"type":"question","counter":657,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[4566\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000080#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the date that has been set for Russian authorities to visit Dublin to conduct bilateral discussions; and if she will confirm the persons that will be attending these talks on behalf of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and from her Department.","asker":"1018","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":658,"content":"<p>As Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention future adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bilateral agreement.

The draft report contains information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compares rates with other countries.  The researcher experienced unforeseen difficulties in accessing information sources and as a result, submitted the first stage of the report behind schedule in late January 2012. The researcher informed my Department that this was due primarily to the challenges with accessing historical data from a time when records on the procedure were not routinely kept. The second stage in the research process, involved a consultation process on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have undergone symphysiotomy.  The researcher is currently finalising the report based on the consultation and it is also planned to have a peer review process.

In 2010, the European Commission issued guidance that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards.  This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives.  However, challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract.

The contract also provides that junior doctors shall not be required to work more than 24 consecutive hours on-site.  A related agreement between the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation provides that the contract is subject to the requirements of the Directive.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to achieving compliance with the European Working Time Directive in respect of junior doctors by 2014 and I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue.  While there has been a significant reduction in the weekly hours worked by junior doctors in recent years, typically they continue to work approximately 55 hours per week.  Further work is therefore required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Directive. <\/p><p>  In January 2012, a detailed plan for the achievement of compliance by junior doctors with the Working Time Directive was submitted to the EU Commission.  The plan affirmed Ireland's commitment to achieving compliance with the Directive over a three-year time period.  It committed to implementing the measures necessary, including: new work patterns for medical staff, transfer of work undertaken by junior doctors to other grades, and the organisation of hospital services to support compliance.  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address the issue as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the junior doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission. The HSE is currently finalising its National Operational Plan to support the implementation of the National Service Plan 2013. This will specify in greater detail the actions to be taken during the year in relation to EWTD compliance. A key priority for the HSE in 2013 will be a further reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000083#WREE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000083#WREE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[4712\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000083#WREE00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will investigate the homecare package for a child (details supplied) in Dublin 9.","asker":"1012","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":710,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000083#WREE00800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000083#WREE00850"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[4713\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013013000083#WREE00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding dental treatment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Dublin","asker":"1012","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>Dental services to children up to 16 years are provided by the Public Dental Service of the HSE.

The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a key commitment in the Programme for Government and the largest project within the current Capital Plan.  This Government regards the building of the hospital as a priority and no effort will be spared in expediting its completion.  Following the Government decision on the location, my first priority has been to address the necessary project management structures and governance arrangements to enable the delivery of the capital  project as quickly as possible and to the highest quality.  The scale, complexity and vital importance of this project means we must get this element right now, and I have therefore given this detailed consideration and intend to bring proposals to Government shortly. <\/p><p>  Pending the implementation of revised project management and governance arrangements, work is continuing on the project through the existing mechanisms, including the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.

Following the Government's decision to locate the new hospital on the St James's campus, a review is now underway on the location and number of urgent care centres, which is expected to be complete in the coming weeks.  Preliminary work in relation to the site and site preparation is ongoing, and immediate next steps will include the termination of existing contracts, following legal advice, followed by new procurement processes which will be fully compliant with statutory periods.
