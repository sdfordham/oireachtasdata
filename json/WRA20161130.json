Therefore producer prices in Ireland are largely determined by commodity prices on world markets, rather than by production levels within Ireland itself.  We have seen significant commodity price volatility on world markets over the last few years.  However, there are measures in place to help Irish farmers through these periods.

I chair the Food Wise High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), with high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.

The intended objective of such heritage licences was, according to the report, to optimally facilitate traditional fishing practices in conjunction with the establishment of a producer organisation representing vessels under a certain length overall in those designated areas.    <\/p>  <p>  There have been some important changes in the landscape since this report made its recommendations, and particularly in terms of representation of rural coastal communities in sea-fisheries policy making.  The National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) and Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) were established in May 2014 and have now been up and running for 2 years.  The Forums are consultative structures which provide arenas for inshore fishermen to develop proposals on inshore fisheries management, including compliance and data gathering.  The Inshore Forums are representative of the inshore fishing boats, generally less than 12m in overall length and focus on sea-fisheries management in the coastal waters within 6 nautical miles.       <\/p>  <p>  To date, from its first meeting in January 2015, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum has met 8 times.  These meetings have led to very constructive two-way conversations on issues of mutual concern, industry priorities, emerging policies &amp;amp; initiatives.  As a result of the successful discussions with the Forum, NIFF members have been included in a number of sea-fisheries consultative platforms namely: the SFPA Consultative Committee, the Quota Management Advisory Committee, the Bord Bia\/BIM market advisory group, the EMFF Operational Programme Monitoring Committee (which oversees implementation of the EMFF in Ireland), the Fisheries Industry Science Partnership (chaired by the Marine Institute) and the Celtic Sea Herring management advisory committee.  This gives the inshore sector a role in making recommendations on the allocation of Ireland&rsquo;s quotas, on market development initiatives, on data collection and scientific research and, perhaps most importantly, on how funding is utilised.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the NIFF is taking the industry lead in setting priorities for the policy development for the inshore sector and I give consideration to recommendations from the NIFF.  In our meetings, we have discussed a whole series of practical things we can do to help the inshore sector, including the development of artisan fisheries, funding for inshore sector projects and management measures for shellfish fisheries, such as the restrictions on recreational potting that were introduced in February. <\/p>  <p>  Recommendations such as those in the former sub-committee&rsquo;s report regarding heritage licences and producer organisations are matters which the NIFF may wish to consider and, if deemed appropriate, bring forward.

I believe that this is a good start and I will press on to get as many actions as possible completed within the next year.<\/p><p>  Environmental sustainability is at the heart of Food Wise, which states that &ldquo;environmental protection and economic competitiveness are equal and complementary: one cannot be achieved at the expense of the other&rdquo;.  An Environmental Sustainability Subgroup was established under the auspices of HLIC to monitor and drive the sustainability actions outlined in Food Wise 2025.<\/p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s whole of Government approach to sustainability includes development of coherent and cost-effective policies to meet the twin challenges of sustainable food production and climate change in the agriculture and land use sector.  The national policy position is based on an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  Officials from my Department work very closely with other Departments and in particular, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment which is the lead in this area.<\/p><p>  Through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the application of emerging scientific knowledge, Ireland is taking the necessary steps towards addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions in the Irish agriculture sector.  Nevertheless, we cannot afford to be complacent, and I acknowledge that meeting our international commitments on climate change will be challenging.  That is why the Rural Development Programme, worth almost &euro;4 billion over 7 years, is strongly targeted towards environmental benefits, including knowledge transfer programmes, which will bring the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers.<\/p><p>  My Department is also contributing to the National Mitigation Plan, which is being prepared under the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act.  The work on the national plan is overseen by Government through a hierarchy of committees and sub-groups, with independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council.  These committees and groups include the Cabinet Committee and the Senior Officials' Group on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, a Technical Research and Modelling Group and a Domestic Climate Finance Group.<\/p><p>  DAFM is a key stakeholder in the implementation of the National Regulations  referred to as the Nitrates or the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) Regulations.  These regulations protect water through the implementation of specific controls and are aimed at minimising the loss of Nutrients from Agriculture.  Substantial investments has been made both by my Department and the farming community to implement the GAP measures under the Nitrates Action Programme since their introduction in 2006.  Additionally, under our Agri-environment scheme, GLAS, farmers in areas of high water status and vulnerable water bodies have priority entry to the scheme whilst measures such as 'Fencing of Watercourses' within the scheme are designed specifically to enhance water quality.  The scheme is therefore very much targeted at improving water quality and this objective is supported by both the Knowledge Transfer and the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000053#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dairy Sector","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000053#WRA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[37696\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000053#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to deal with the forthcoming increase in stock in the dairy sector and its inevitable impact on the beef market.","asker":"1345","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>I am very aware that following a positive start to 2016<font color=\"#1F497D\">,<\/font>beef farmers have faced a number of challenges as the year has progressed.  The immediate impact of Brexit has been seen in our currency exchange rates and has affected our primary major export market. Beef production is also up here and in the UK in 2016.<\/p><p>Looking at the market outlook for the remainder of the year it is estimated that the total number of cattle available for slaughter at export plants for the year 2016 is expected to be between 70,000 and 80,000 greater than 2015.  Figures for the year so far to the week ending 20th November 2016 show that approximately 71,000 extra cattle have been slaughtered so far this year compared to the same period in 2015, an increase of 5.2%.<\/p><p>I am very much aware of the impact that the expansion in the national dairy herd will have on the Irish beef herd and this matter was discussed by all stakeholders at the most recent meeting of the Beef Roundtable.  The true impact any increase in the number of cattle in the national herd will have on the beef market will be determined by different factors such as slaughter dates which will vary depending on the system of production on different farms.  I have also asked Teagasc to undertake some analysis on the routes to market for the increased number of dairy calves and they have recently completed this work.  We will now analyse it with the relevant stakeholders and consider some next steps.<\/p><p>One of the key elements in coping with an increased supply in Irish beef is ensuring that there is a market for such beef.  There is a strong demand for meat globally including beef and  figures from the European Commission's most recent Short Term Outlook for meat markets show a projected growth of per capita beef consumption of 2.1% for 2016.  Whilst we exported approximately 97% of our beef exports in 2015 to the UK and EU I am very conscious of the importance of growing international markets as a valuable outlet for any increased Irish beef production.  Indeed this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  Very significant progress has been made in this context in recent years and my Department is currently in the process of attempting to secure beef access to a range of Third Countries including China, South Korea, Ukraine, Thailand and Vietnam.  This builds on the opening of some major markets in the last two years including the US, Canada and Japan.  This is a vital means of providing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector with as many commercial opportunities as possible for Irish beef in addition to our existing European markets. <\/p><p>I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers especially in an environment where the number of calf births has increased in recent years.  The recent opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports has seen over 8,000 cattle make the trip so far, a number which will increase further by the end of 2016.  I also note that exports of live cattle to Libya have recommenced which is a positive and welcome development.  My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan, Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco.  I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.<\/p><p>One of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.

The loans are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts. <\/p>  <p>  I also recently announced the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme, which will be operational as early as possible in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments.  Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year.  This will be available immediately, for this year&rsquo;s tax liability, and this will go some way towards addressing current cash flow concerns. <\/p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made this year in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes.  Advance payments commenced on the 17th October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations.  Up to last week, &euro;791.7 million has been paid out to 120,224 farmers and payments are ongoing. <\/p>  <p>  I was also pleased to note that the processing of the Areas of Natural Constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected that approx 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.

It was important that it be given consideration at European Union level, because any solutions will be most effective if adopted at that level.

The data further up the supply chain is not as transparent.  In order to strengthen the position of farmers in the supply chain, I have signed legislation for the recognition of Producer Organisations in the beef sector into law earlier this year.  This will allow groups of farmers to come together to negotiate directly with factories.  An application for approval of funding for the provision of advice to Producer Organisations and prospective Producer Organisations under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme has been made to the European Commission and my Department is currently awaiting a decision on this application as part of Ireland&rsquo;s second RDP amendment.

My Department, by letter of 14 December 2001, submitted the application to the Commission to increase the capacity of the Polyvalent and RSW Pelagic segments in accordance with the applications.

Since then the vessel owners have taken the EU Commission, in a series of actions, to the European Court.  In summary, this involved a number of the vessel owners, whose requests were rejected, successfully challenging the Commission&rsquo;s Decision in the European Court.  The vessel owners concerned requested the Commission to adopt a new decision complying with the criteria in the judgement.  The Commission issued new decisions again refusing the applications.

The background to this issue is arrangements which have long been in existence to provide access for fishing.  <\/p>  <p>  The London Fisheries Convention 1964 allowed that each Coastal State could assert exclusive fishing rights within 6 nautical miles from its baselines under Article 2.  It also provided for contracting parties to allow those fishermen from another coastal state who had habitually fished within that belt to continue to do so by reason of Voisinage arrangements under Article 9.  On this basis, pre-existing reciprocal arrangements were re-affirmed at the time by means of an exchange of letters in the 1960s between the UK\/Northern Ireland and Ireland which allowed for vessels from Northern Ireland to fish within Ireland&rsquo;s 6 nautical mile zone and vice versa.  The Common Fisheries Policy provides for the continuation of such neighbourhood arrangements, specifically within Article 5 of Regulation 1380\/2013.  <\/p>  <p>  In light of the Supreme Court judgment, fishing by Northern Ireland vessels in Irish territorial waters is not currently provided for in domestic law.  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing vessels in the 0-6 nautical mile zone relying on the Voisinage Arrangements; fishing activities which have a legal basis, reliant on access arrangements to Ireland&rsquo;s 6-12 nautical mile zone in the EU Regulation 1380\/2013, are not affected.  <\/p>  <p>  I have notified the matter to the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Michelle McIlveen MLA and I am keeping Minister McIlveen appraised of developments as appropriate.  My department is remaining in close contact with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland on the issue.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision in domestic law for them.  The Government has been notified of the development and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office is examining the Supreme Court judgment.  It is my intention to bring a proposal to Government to prepare a legislative amendment to address the issues raised by the judgment and preparations are underway in my department for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000054#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":91,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hare Coursing Regulation","counter":92,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000054#WRB04500"},{"type":"question","counter":93,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[37400\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000054#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on whether the treatment of hares is humane in view of recently reported incidents (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1306","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":94,"content":"<p>Under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, the regulation of coursing is chiefly a matter for the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon (BnG).<\/p>  <p>  The ICC has assured my Department that it has extensive systems and practices in place to underpin the welfare of hares and greyhounds involved in coursing and that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards of welfare are adhered to.<\/p>  <p>  Hares can only be collected for coursing by clubs affiliated to the ICC in accordance with the terms of two\u00a0licences granted by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<\/p>  <p>  These licences contain 26 conditions which have been\u00a0refined over the years, the majority of which are central to hare welfare.

Phase 1 (identification of key themes for the new Strategy) and Phase 2 (identification and agreement of high level objectives under each agreed theme) of that consultation process have been completed.  The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements), is currently underway.  This process will provide a new set of specific, cross-Departmental actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma.  It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year.<\/p><p>The issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy.  In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society.  This followed a process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs during 2015, which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or legislative or expenditure implications arising from such recognition.  The key point is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely symbolically important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced.  Such a symbolic gesture &ndash; as the Traveller NGO paper argues &ndash; could have the potential to create a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and honest dialogue.<\/p><p>I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014).

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review and I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p>  <p>   I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that the area concerned is patrolled by Gardai assigned to Tallaght Garda Station which is part of the Tallaght Garda District.  I am informed that on 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 241 Garda&iacute; assigned to Tallaght Garda District,19 of which were Community Garda&iacute;. <\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner has advised that it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.

The proposed amendment to this section does not abolish the dwelling house exemption in full but will act to deny the exemption in circumstances that are not in line with the original policy objective of the exemption.

Firstly, the dwelling house exemption will only be available for inheritances.  With one exception, it will no longer be possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception will be where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person's principal private residence at the date of his or her death.

The actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including identity based bullying such as homophobic and transphobic bullying, are addressed. <\/p><p>As part of the implementation of the Plan, new Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools were published in September 2013.  The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils.  The procedures require that a school&rsquo;s written anti-bullying policy must explicitly deal with identity-based bullying including, in particular, homophobic and transphobic bullying. Harassment related to any of the nine discriminatory grounds set out in equality legislation, of which gender including transgender is one, is legally prohibited in schools and colleges in Ireland.  The Anti-Bullying Procedures require schools to confirm in their anti-bullying policy that the school will, in accordance with its obligations under equality legislation, take all such steps that are reasonably practicable to prevent the sexual harassment of pupils or staff.  Such prohibitions apply to all aspects of a school or institution&rsquo;s life, including class time, sports activities or tours and include anyone who visits the school or college. \u00a0<\/p><p>A number of anti-bullying initiatives that focus on homophobic and transphobic bullying are also being supported through the Action Plan.  For example, &ldquo;Being LGBT in School&rdquo; A Resource for Post-Primary Schools to Prevent homophobic and Transphobic Bullying and Support LGBT Students was developed by the Gay and Lesbian Network Equality (GLEN) with the support of my Department.  The resource aims to help schools in addressing homophobic and transphobic bullying and supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.  It includes a section addressing the specific support needs of students who identify as transgender.  In addition, the Department has provided funding and other support for the Stand Up! Against Homophobic and Transphobic bullying campaign, organised by BeLong To. <\/p><p>The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team have developed a number of resources in the area of Relationship and Sexuality Education.  The resources include guidance for teachers, schools and guidance counsellors on their role in supporting LGBT students.  These resources have been developed in conjunction with representative groups and are available at .  Support is also available for schools through the HSE.  Further details are available at <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>In October 2015 my Department hosted a roundtable discussion on transgender children in schools.  The roundtable provided an opportunity for the exchange of information and perspectives on the possible impact of the Gender Recognition Act 2015 on schools.  Attendance at the event included representatives of the education partners, Government Departments, agencies and NGOs.  The discussions were wide-ranging and covered many aspects of school life.<\/p><p>There are also a range of supports and services available to transgender students in universities and institutes of technology.  Most higher education institutions (HEIs) have LGBT societies which advocate on behalf of LGBT students and which receive funding directly from the HEI concerned.  The students unions of each HEI also have Student Welfare Officers who can provide advice and support to all students, including LGBT students.  Many students unions also have dedicated LGBT officers.  Similarly, HEIs also have Student Support and Development Services in place which, while providing service to the general student population, can also provide specific supports to transgender students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000055#WRC02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parent and Student Charter","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000055#WRC02650"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[37929\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000055#WRC02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the new parent and student charter Bill will include departmental guidelines for schools to address the need to honour a parent's constitutional\u00a0right for their child to opt out of faith formation during the school day; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware the Programme for a Partnership Government provides that the Government will introduce a stronger complaints procedure and charter for parents.<\/p><p>My Department has been working on draft legislation to provide for replacing the current Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded based on the average yearly contributions made during a working life.  Those with a yearly average of 48+ contributions receive a 100% pension, where, for example, those with only a yearly average of 20 contributions receive an 85% pension (not means-tested).  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits, and was not back-dated for periods of homemaking prior to its introduction.<\/p>  <p>  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;222 (95% of the maximum contributory pension).   <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate.  Following examination of the changes in the contribution rules and the associated rates of payment introduced in September 2012, the Review found that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories still obtain the best value from their contributions. <\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of next year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000056#WRD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Education Allowance Eligibility","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000056#WRD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[37871\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000056#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if an application for the back to education allowance will be awarded without delay as the person (details supplied) has no financial means.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":268,"content":"<p>The person mentioned made enquiries about accessing the back to education allowance scheme (BTEA) at her local Intreo Centre.

Two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, have been contracted to deliver the service.  These companies have established over 80 service locations around the country and employ nearly 600 staff.  Over 60,000 jobseekers have commenced their engagement with the JobPath companies. <\/p>  <p>  The service is being delivered through a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies i.e. the model is so structured that the contractors cannot recover their costs or make a profit unless they successfully place jobseekers into full time, paid and sustainable employment.  Contractors are paid via a combination of an initial registration fee and thereafter job sustainment fees which are paid in respect of 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks of sustained employment of at least 30 hours per week.  <\/p>  <p>  The overall cost of the service will be determined by the number of people who engage with the service and the number of jobseekers who successfully obtain and sustain employment. It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.  <\/p>  <p>  Both companies are subject to regular on-site inspections to ensure that the service is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations.  My department has also commissioned a customer satisfaction survey to independently assess whether customers who are referred to the service are satisfied with the level, and quality, of service delivered by the contractors.  The results of the survey are expected in the coming weeks.  Payments to contractors can be reduced if the results of the survey or of the inspections indicate that the quality of service is not satisfactory.<\/p>  <p>  Given that the engagement period on JobPath is 12 months and also that rollout was phased it will take time to accumulate a sufficient number of completed engagements to support a robust impact evaluation.  Nevertheless the department intends to carry out a preliminary econometric counterfactual impact evaluation of JobPath over the coming months, this work is expected to be completed in mid-2017 and will be followed in early 2018 by an independent third party evaluation.  In addition, my department has agreed to facilitate the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed (INOU) to conduct an external review of client experience with JobPath.  This is expected to be undertaken early next year.  <\/p>  <p>  The JobPath service commenced in 2015 and the contracts are for six years comprising two consecutive phases: phase one entails four years&rsquo; of client referrals while phase two entails a &lsquo;run off&rsquo; period during which time no additional clients will be referred, but services will be delivered to completion for those clients referred during phase one.

The Pensions Act 1990, as amended, together with regulations made under that Act, is the legislation pertaining to occupational and private pensions and therefore relevant to the transposition of the directive.<\/p>  <p>  Standards in relation to occupational pension schemes will be enhanced by the transposition of the IORP II directive.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000056#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Social Scheme Eligibility","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000056#WRD04350"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[37912\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000056#WRD04400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the way in which the proposed six year limit for future RSS participants will be applied to existing participants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":280,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be fully aware RSS provides opportunities for farmers and fishermen and women who are currently in receipt of specified social welfare payments to work to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the social welfare budget package for 2017, I announced an increase of &euro;5 a week in the personal rate of payment for rural social scheme (RSS) participants from March 2017.

They can be found throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  There is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence.  The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to 28 February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as the National Parks.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls may be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.<\/p><p>Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners, who may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.<\/p><p>With regard to calls for increased fencing in relation to incidents of deer presence on public roads, my Department has no plans to fence the National Parks. Deer, albeit larger, are like other wild animals in this country and it is not part of the remit of my Department, nor indeed would it be generally possible, to cordon them onto specific areas of land.

The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.  In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  More recently, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population was conducted by the Health Research Board (HRB) on behalf of the Department.  This review was published by the HRB in June 2015.  The HRB found no definitive evidence that community water fluoridation is associated with negative health effects.  A research project \"Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth\" (FACCT) is being conducted by UCC and supported by the HSE.  Preliminary results indicate that children's oral health has been improving, fluoridated communities have lower levels of dental caries. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.

According to Bord Bia, overall meat exports increased by &euro;140 million to &euro;3.5 billion. <\/p>  <p>  Although exports to the UK and EU account for the majority of meat exports, I am very conscious of the importance of growing international markets as a valuable outlet for Irish beef, lamb and pigmeat production and very significant progress has been made in this context in recent years.  Indeed this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 Strategy, given the changing global demographics and emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere, and has been given an added impetus by the outcome of the UK referendum on Brexit.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While the results of the UK referendum pose a challenge, my Department and our agencies, in association with our stakeholders, have been giving careful consideration to the potential impacts of a UK exit, looking at the areas in which the greatest risks are likely to arise and on which we will need to focus when exit negotiations begin.  As part of our overall contingency planning, the Department has established a dedicated unit to work on these issues and has convened a consultative committee of stakeholders to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed.<\/p>  <p>  One of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation with 90% of our food produce leaving the island. In this context Minister Doyle and I lead a very successful Trade Mission to China, Vietnam, South Korea and Singapore in September.  This Mission resulted in positive progress in relation to the next steps in terms of gaining beef market access to China, South Korea and Vietnam, including inter alia a commitment by Chinese officials in AQSIQ to expedite consideration of a technical inspection report from their visit to Ireland earlier this year as well as the submission of detailed beef questionnaires to the relevant authorities in South Korea and Vietnam. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I led a Trade Mission to Morocco and my officials also travelled to Algeria, with a focus on live cattle exports.  Live cattle exports to Turkey also commenced in September following our recent approval to export live cattle there.

This is done by inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain. Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied.  In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is\u00a0referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.

The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States.

In November Bord Bia ran a series of workshops for farmers markets &ndash; in Limerick, Cork, Galway and Wicklow.  Total attendance was 109, exceeding the Bord Bia target of 80, and included experienced market holders as well as start up and potential producers.  Feedback was very positive and Bord Bia is now considering developing a programme for market managers to support the development of this important local route to market.  <\/p>  <p>  For a number of years my Department has provided bursaries for the UCC Diploma in Speciality Food Production, a food science and business course for food producers, potential start-ups and those interested in developing businesses and \/or promoting the artisan sector. Over 180 students have graduated, many are successfully running small artisan and speciality food businesses.  My Department will continue to fund bursaries over the next 4 years to maintain this momentum. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000059#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":491,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000059#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[37981\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000059#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the full extent of employment currently provided throughout the food industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>The CSO&rsquo;s four Quarterly National Household Surveys in 2015 showed that employment in the agri-food sector overall, including all its component parts, averaged around 170,000.

FoodWise 2025 envisages a further significant expansion in agricultural output, primarily based on animal production over the next 10 years.  It is therefore essential that all stakeholders in the livestock sector collaborate to ensure, insofar as possible, compliance with the highest animal health standards.  In view of this and of the importance I attach to animal health matters, I launched a consultation process last September on the development of a new Farmed Animal Health Strategy framework for Ireland.  A coherent and robust Strategy has the capability to deliver very significant savings per annum as has been evidenced in the case of the recent progress being made on the BVD eradication programme.  On the other hand, sub-optimal animal health impacts negatively at individual farm level, on processor returns, on the environment and ultimately on international trade and domestic employment levels.\u00a0 In addition, zoonotic infections in animals as well as the avoidable use of antibiotics in animals may impact on public health.  The principle that guides the Strategy, \u00a0&lsquo;Prevention is better than Cure,&rsquo; seeks to change the focus from one of post-event response and the management of disease, to one that promotes animal health as a driver of optimised production, improved margins for producers and providing the best quality for consumers. \u00a0My Department is currently reviewing submissions received from stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I should also mention the most recent meeting of the Agriculture North South Ministerial Council in October, which provided an opportunity, together with Michelle McIlveen MLA, Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, to review progress on the All-Island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy Action Plan.  In the context of Brexit, the Council agreed to the continuation of practical and effective North South co-operation on animal health and welfare, and disease control in both jurisdictions in order that the health and welfare of livestock is maintained at the highest level.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0At EU level, a major revamp of the European Union Animal health law (AHL) was agreed by the Council and the European Parliament in March 2016, and will be applicable from 2021.\u00a0 The new AHL provides for the adoption of a single and simplified regulatory framework for animal health by putting greater focus on preventative measures, disease surveillance, controls and research in order to reduce the incidence of animal diseases and minimise the impact of outbreaks when they occur.\u00a0 It sets out the basic principles of animal health including rules for movements of animals, animal products and products of animal origin and disease control and eradication measures.  It also lays down conditions for early detection and disease notification.  Some 40 existing EU directives and regulations will be superseded when the AHL is implemented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000059#WRG00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Eligibility","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000059#WRG00950"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[37991\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000059#WRG01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of entitlements in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":499,"content":"<p>In order to be eligible for an automatic allocation of entitlements under the Basic Payment Scheme, a farmer must have been eligible to receive a direct payment under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme and be eligible for participation under the 2015 Basic Payment Scheme.

Council conclusions on the issue are expected to be adopted in December, and the Commission has undertaken to consider the report's recommendations in the context of its Work Programme for 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The report examines a range of issues such as market transparency, risk management, futures markets and trading practices, and\u00a0makes a series of recommendations with\u00a0a view to strengthening the position of farmers across the supply chain.\u00a0 The recommendations include\u00a0consideration of the introduction of an EU-wide legislative framework for unfair trading practices, the development of futures markets, increasing market transparency and the mandatory inclusion by Member States of actions promoting on-farm risk management strategies under their Rural Development Programmes.<\/p>  <p>  I very much welcome the report by the Markets Task Force.\u00a0 I believe that the prerequisite for a sustainable food supply chain is free and fair competition, accompanied by balanced relationships between all of the entities along the chain.  It is very important that all operators\u00a0acknowledge their interdependence with each other.  This means that they need to work together to develop a model which sustains agricultural production, without which none of the downstream industrial or service sectors could exist.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the report&rsquo;s recommendations, I believe that an EU-wide framework\u00a0would represent the correct approach to\u00a0dealing with\u00a0unfair trading practices.  Our own experience with the new Grocery Goods Regulations, which entered into force at the end of April\u00a0this year following extensive consultation, demonstrated that a voluntary regime would not have the confidence of all stakeholders.  We have also learned\u00a0from our\u00a0experience of agri-food legislation on safety, traceability and quality\u00a0that the Single Market requires legislative frameworks to function well and freely.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, changes to the legislative framework are unlikely to be enough.\u00a0 Supply chain imbalances invariably become a focal point in periods of increased volatility.\u00a0 Measures to reduce costs, improve competitiveness and support innovation will also be required in order to improve sustainability.\u00a0 Efforts in this regard can be industry-led but ideally should have cross-stakeholder buy-in.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the report&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to improving market transparency.\u00a0 Price monitoring is limited by the lack of availability of data and models. While producer returns at primary level are quite well publicised and retail prices are known, there is little data on the basis on which they are constructed.  The establishment of price monitoring platforms and deeper input to these platforms by Member States, as suggested in the report, is useful and is something we can support.<\/p>  <p>  The findings of the report are still being reviewed and consideration is now being given to the introduction of practical and sensible measures at an appropriate level.

This Bill was required to give effect to the Government Decision of 15<sup>th<\/sup>November 2011 to rationalise the State&rsquo;s existing employment rights and industrial relations dispute resolution bodies.  Following on from these Government decisions the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has undertaken and completed an extensive programme of reform of the State&rsquo;s employment rights and industrial relations procedures.  The legislation which has given statutory effect to the reform programme, namely the Workplace Relations Act 2015, was enacted on 20<sup>th<\/sup>May, 2015. <\/p><p>During the preparatory stage of this legislation, the Minister engaged in extensive public consultation in framing the proposals for a radical reform of the State&rsquo;s Workplace Relations Services.  This process included two extensive public consultation exercises and the publication of two policy papers which helped inform the design and delivery of the reform.  The responses received from stakeholders demonstrated a strong consensus around the need for reform and the shape that reform should take.  The Policy document <i>&lsquo;Legislating for a World Class Workplace Relations Service&rsquo; <\/i>was submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in July, 2012 and the Minister had a constructive dialogue with the Committee in July, 2012 on the basis of the document.  <\/p><p>Numerous meetings also took place with interested parties, representative of employees, employers and equality interests including IBEC and ICTU to get their input into the process. <\/p><p>The Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides for the establishment of a new two-tier workplace relations structure to replace the previously existing five workplace relations bodies.  A new single body of first instance called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) was created from 1<sup>st<\/sup>October 2015 and a separate appeals body, which is effectively an expanded Labour Court. <\/p><p>The WRC incorporates the functions of the Labour Relations Commission (including the Rights Commissioner Service), the Equality Tribunal, the Employment Appeals Tribunal (first instance jurisdiction only), and the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  Three of the bodies listed above have been dis-established following the transfer of their functions to the WRC.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal will be dis-established once it has dealt with the caseload submitted to it prior to 1<sup>st<\/sup>October 2015.<\/p><p>The putting in place of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 is the most far-reaching legislative reform in the area of employment and industrial relations in almost 70 years.  The result is a more straightforward and user friendly system allowing both expert and non-expert users navigate their way around the employment and industrial relations machinery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000059#WRG05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[37808\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016113000059#WRG05700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the decisions of the WRC that are legally enforceable; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>The Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides for the establishment of a new two-tier workplace relations structure to replace the previously existing five workplace relations bodies.
