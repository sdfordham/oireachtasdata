Under those Schemes, maximum retirement benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension, the rate of which varies according to retiring rank and other factors, is payable for the person&rsquo;s lifetime. <\/p>  <p>  Where qualifying service is more than 21 years, an &lsquo;additional increment&rsquo; is payable at a flat rate (generally &euro;8.94 a week currently) for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years.  However, under the pension scheme rules, this additional increment ceases to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age for the social welfare State Pension Contributory, that is, at age 66 to 68 depending on when the insured person was born. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that these arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in a full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates, who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts such as the State Pension. <\/p>  <p>  Integration means that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to social insurance benefits is taken into account when calculating the rate of occupational pension payable.  The State Pension is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual.  The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries. <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised that the method of integration for these &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; military pensioners is more favourable than in other areas of the public service where standard integration applies.  In the public service generally, integration begins from the time the retirement pension starts payment, for example from age 60 where &lsquo;standard pension accrual&rsquo; applies.  However, these NCOs or Privates who serve 31 years having joined the Defence Forces at age 18\/20, can qualify for maximum retirement benefits payable immediately from age 49\/51.\u00a0 In their case, the integration process only begins when the State Pension becomes payable to them, for example, at age 66.  Furthermore, the maximum personal rate of the State Pension (&euro;238.30 currently) is considerably greater than any reduction that could arise under the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pension arrangements by virtue of the loss of the additional increment on qualification for the State Pension. <\/p>  <p>  The general issue of integration of retirement pensions in the public service was examined by the Commission on Public Service Pensions.  Its Final Report, published in November 2000, was considered and broadly accepted by Government.  The Commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pension framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and Privates covered by the pre-April 2004 Defence Forces pensions schemes.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that there are currently 8,645 retired NCOs and Privates in receipt of Defence Forces retirement pensions, of whom 2,737 had 31 years&rsquo; service or more.\u00a0 This latter figure includes retirees who have already reached State Pension age or who have yet to do so. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As regards the number of retired NCOs and Privates &ndash; with 22 or more years&rsquo; service &ndash; whose retirement pensions were reduced as a result of the cessation of the additional increment when they reached State Pension age (66), the information in question is being compiled from the relevant payroll data and will be sent to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000067#WRB04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Remuneration","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000067#WRB04500"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[12714\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000067#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans to provide overtime payments to members of the Defence Forces that recently worked in excess of their contracted hours during Storm Emma; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>All the available resources and capabilities of the Defence Forces were at the disposal of the principal response agencies in reaction to the recent extreme weather event.\u00a0 In this regard, the Defence Forces and Civil Defence made a substantial and coordinated contribution to local efforts on a national basis.<\/p>  <p>  Unlike other areas of the Public Service and due to the nature of the duties performed, overtime payments are not available to members of the Defence Forces.

The Taoiseach met with Prime Minister Rutte in Dublin on 6 December and I hope to meet with newly-appointed Foreign Minister Blok in the near future. Consultations at official level most recently took place on 12 February. <\/p>  <p>  These meetings are allowing for valuable exchanges on the ongoing negotiations as well as wider discussion on the impact that Brexit will have on our respective economies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000069#WRD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Promotion","counter":107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000069#WRD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":108,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[12200\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000069#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of passport waiting lists (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":109,"content":"<p>The Passport Service provides a range of channels to Irish citizens wishing to apply for a passport.

However, the matter is scheduled for the Commission meeting at the end of March. The proposal from management involves sourcing the banknotes from within the Eurozone, and ceasing the printing of banknotes at the Central Bank&rsquo;s Currency Centre.  The\u00a0proposal to\u00a0source\u00a0banknotes from within the Eurozone is\u00a0in line with the approach taken in many other national central banks in the Eurozone (i.e. a number of national central banks within the Eurozone do not print banknotes themselves).<\/p>  <p>  This proposed change will have no impact on the supply of banknotes in Ireland, the majority of which are produced elsewhere.

As Minister for Finance I can only respond in relation to the recommendations made in relation to my own Department.<\/p><p>The tribunal pointed out problems to be addressed in our system of financial regulation.  Poor supervision, an overly-deferential attitude by regulators, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement, all played a part in the financial crisis.  I and my European counterparts have been working steadfastly since the financial crisis to bring about strengthened oversight and resolution regimes. The entire financial services landscape has changed utterly, characterised by the presence of new European institutions; strengthened regulations; a more intrusive supervisory approach; and a new focus on macroprudential requirements.<\/p><p>New European regulations have strengthened controls over the banking system and have resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution regimes. The capital requirements' regulation and directive, which came into force in 2014, brought about significant enhancements in the quality and quantity of capital that banks are required to hold and the setting of minimum liquidity requirements. <\/p><p>The Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism have transformed the framework for dealing with failing banks and are designed to provide a financial safety net and a means for recovery and resolution with minimum disruption to the sovereign. The overarching objective of the BRRD is to shift the cost of bank failure from taxpayers to shareholders and creditors of the institutions themselves. <\/p><p>The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is now responsible for the prudential supervision framework for euro area banks. The central piece of the SSM supervisory process is the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) under which ECB led joint supervisory teams inspect business models, internal governance, profitability and banking risks.<\/p><p>All of these new regulations and institutional arrangements have been designed to address the challenges of banking oversight and resolution at a European level and provide for a pro-active approach towards systemic and emergent risks at a European level.<\/p><p>Besides the introduction of new European and national regulations, the Central Bank too has increased its resources and has become more pro-active in addressing systemic risk.<\/p><p>In response to the Tribunal recommendations I considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and decided against introducing such relief. The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations. Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted. Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted. These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.<\/p><p><b>Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders - <\/b><\/p><p>In relation to this proposal, I remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform. Representations are a valid part of the political process. The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.<\/p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has advised in relation to the following recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal that:<\/p><p><b>Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners- <\/b><\/p><p>Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments.

His Department announced in May 2017 that funding of &euro;49,000 would be provided to the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) to support an initiative through which they would develop proposals regarding special purpose vehicles.  The purpose of this initiative was to provide a mechanism that would enable the sector to attract investment in social housing projects from potential investors, including the credit union movement.  The ICSH has completed 2 of the 3 phases of the project and anticipates that this work should be completed later this year. <\/p><p>Moreover, the Government acknowledges the affordability pressures faced by some households with low to moderate incomes in particular parts of the country.  It is precisely for that reason that the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness has also prioritised the supply of new and more affordable homes.  On 22 January 2018, a package of initiatives to help alleviate affordability pressures faced by households, particularly in areas of high housing demand and high accommodation costs were announced by Minister Murphy.

In this regard, my Department is working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Council and the Central Bank of Ireland to complete the work on the transposing regulations well in advance of the deadline of 1 July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000073#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Excise Duties Collection","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000073#WRH02000"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[12773\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000073#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to investigate with the Revenue Commissioners the efforts they are making in order to increase their patrol of goods and products entering the country in small packages from non-EU countries for excise duty and taxes in view of the effect that cheap imported products which go on for resale here are having on local SMEs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":325,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the importation of purchases made by online shoppers from non-EU countries are generally carried out either by express couriers or through the postal system.

There are number of\u00a0tax incentives\u00a0already in operation which incentivise the purchase and renovation of certain qualifying dwellings which may otherwise fall into dereliction.<\/p>  <p>  The Living City Initiative (LCI) targets dwellings built before 1915 which demonstrate clear evidence of neglect, dereliction and under-use.  The dwellings must be located within the designated &lsquo;Special Regeneration Areas&rsquo; which are particular urban areas that have been identified as being in need of regeneration.  Individuals participating in the scheme receive a tax relief for expenditure on refurbishment and conversion work.<\/p>  <p>  A review of LCI was undertaken last year by my officials and this was published in the Report on Tax Expenditures (October 2016) that was released on Budget Day.  In light of the findings in the report,\u00a0and in consultation with the relevant councils and the Minister\u00a0for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.\u00a0I announced a number of changes to the scheme in Budget 2017 to make the\u00a0incentive more attractive and effective.  The aim is to get the design right and working in an effective manner.  It is important that the underpinning scheme is made more effective, as until that has been achieved, extension of eligibility for it to other towns or cities would be largely meaningless.  Accordingly, I do not currently propose to extend the\u00a0incentive beyond the present locations.<\/p>  <p>  The Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) was introduced on 25 October 2013 to promote the renovation, repair and improvement of the residential stock.<\/p>  <p>  HRI provides for a tax credit where the VAT exclusive spend on a qualifying property is at least &euro;4,405.  The tax credit represents 13.5% of the total cost of works subject to a maximum credit of &euro;4,050.  The\u00a0incentive was extended from 15 October 2014 to include renovation, repair and improvement of rental properties whose owners are liable to income tax.  The incentive was further extended to local authority tenants from 1 January 2017.  Only works carried out by a tax compliant contractor qualify.  The types of premises to which the Deputy refers may qualify for this incentive.<\/p>  <p>  Historically, there were\u00a0several area-based property incentives in operation, such as the Rural Renewal scheme.  These incentives provided tax relief for expenditure incurred by owner-occupiers on the construction, conversion or refurbishment of residential accommodation in certain designated areas.  Two extensive\u00a0reviews of property taxation incentives were undertaken by independent economic consultants Goodbody and Indecon in 2005, which recommended that the vast majority of these initiatives be ceased.  These recommendations were\u00a0followed and most of these schemes have been gradually phased out of\u00a0the tax code\u00a0since 2006.  I am not in favour of their reintroduction.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, \"Realising our Rural Potential: Action Plan for Rural Development\" contains a detailed list of actions and priorities with a view to revitalising rural Ireland generally.  This\u00a0effort\u00a0is being led by the Minister for Rural and Community Development\u00a0in conjunction with Ministers and officials from other Departments, as well as the Local Authorities and a range of other stakeholders.  A variety of actions included in this plan aim to assist in improving rural towns and making rural Ireland a better place to live.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000073#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":338,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000073#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":339,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[12928\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000073#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to amend the regulations on the disabled drivers' and passengers' scheme to allow drivers of cars bought through a PCP to avail of the scheme.","asker":"1269","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[12929\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000073#WRH03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications under the disabled drivers' and passengers' scheme who were refused access to the scheme to date on the basis that the vehicle in question was bought under a PCP; when the disallowing distinction was introduced; the reason therefor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1269","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":341,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that the qualifying provisions for the Disabled Drivers' and Passengers' Scheme are contained in Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 (Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994).

The OGP also has\u00a0responsibility for procurement policy and procedures.\u00a0 The OGP, as part of my Department, is subject to the Civil Service and Ministerial accountability arrangements. <\/p><p>The encouragement of SME participation in public tendering opportunities has always been a core principle underpinning the OGP&rsquo;s approach to the market.  Accordingly, the OGP takes a balanced approach\u00a0between delivering value for the taxpayer and ensuring that public procurement is accessible by all businesses, including SMEs.  The primary measures\u00a0aimed at\u00a0achieving this objective are:<\/p><p>- Undertaking market analysis prior to\u00a0tendering in order to better understand the range of goods and services on offer; market developments and innovation; what commercial models are available; the competitive landscape; and the specific capabilities of\u00a0SMEs etc.<\/p><p>- Setting proportionate\u00a0eligibility\u00a0requirements, for example insurance and turnover, to support SME participation;<\/p><p>- Breaking tendering competitions into smaller\u00a0lots (for example, by sector, region, value etc.) to actively encourage SME participation and to align with the capacity and capability\u00a0of the\u00a0marketplace;<\/p><p>- Actively engaging in a range of\u00a0events to\u00a0help foster awareness of and to encourage engagement in the\u00a0public\u00a0procurement process;<\/p><p>- Continuous engagement with SME stakeholders and the  main enterprise\u00a0agencies; and<\/p><p>-Promoting supplier awareness of\u00a0eTenders, the Government&rsquo;s national tendering platform<i>(etenders.gov.ie).<\/i><\/p><p>Circular 10\/2014 - Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement - issued by my Department contains a series of measures designed to assist SMEs in Public Procurement and sets out the policy in this regard.\u00a0 This policy was reiterated in the Public Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services issued in July last year.<\/p><p>My colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, chairs the SME Advisory group, which meets on a quarterly basis in accordance with the Programme for Government.\u00a0 This ensures that the voice of Irish SMEs can be heard by Government and the OGP.The group, consisting of representatives from the public sector and SME business representative bodies, has been working to further promote SME participation in the public procurement process.<\/p><p>Finally, it is also important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. Public expenditure on goods, works, and services representing approximately 14% of EU GDP with an annual value of nearly &euro;2 trillion. The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.\u00a0<\/p><p>The OGP will continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that government procurement policies are business friendly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000075#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000075#WRK03100"},{"type":"question","counter":431,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[12472\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000075#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"when he plans to publish reports (details supplied).","asker":"1349","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":432,"content":"<p>The OGP is a division of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, as such, contributes to its Annual Report.

The Vetting Act applies not just to schools but to any relevant organisation that employs, contracts, permits or places a person in relevant work with children or vulnerable persons.  The vetting legislation and the vetting procedures operated by the National Vetting Bureau fall within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  <\/p>  <p>  When the vetting requirements were commenced in April 2016, my Department issued circular 0031\/2016 which set out the statutory vetting requirements applicable to schools along with the practical arrangements in place to support the vetting procedures.  <\/p>  <p>  At the same time, I commenced the vetting related provisions of the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act, 2015 which, inter alia, enabled the Teaching Council to put in place a streamlined mechanism for school employers to meet the statutory vetting requirements in respect of registered teachers.  The existence of the Teaching Council, as a statutory body with a statutory role in the registration of registered teachers, has enabled my Department to bring forward the relevant legislative provisions under the Teaching Council Amendment Act 2015 which have allowed for such a streamlined mechanism to be put in place in the case of registered teachers.  However, it is not possible for my Department to put in place similar legislative arrangements in respect of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  The Vetting Act provides that a relevant organisation must, other than in certain limited circumstances, obtain a vetting disclosure from the National Vetting Bureau prior to commencing the employment of an employee to undertake relevant work with children or vulnerable adults. The Vetting Act allows for some limited exemptions to this requirement, including certain exemptions that are applicable in the case of recurring substitute employments such as a recurring substitute SNA employment.

I, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, negotiated a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers.  The agreements to date have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver convergence of the pay scales at later points in the scale.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, the current starting salary of a new teacher is &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  To have gone further than the pay increases that have been negotiated for 2018 would mean I would have had less money available to hire over 1,000 extra SNAs and over 1,000 extra teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Differential pay scales were introduced by the then Government in 2010. It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently laid before the Oireachtas a report on the matter of the pay of new entrants to the public service.  The report assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011.  The total cost of such adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.  The report also acknowledges that during the financial crisis there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).  Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.<\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s report will inform discussion on remaining salary scale issues with the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 in accordance with the commitment in the Agreement to consider the issue of newly qualified pay.  That process commenced with a first meeting on 12 October 2017.  The three teacher unions attended that first meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000076#WRL04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising Expenditure","counter":492,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000076#WRL04900"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[11765\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000076#WRL05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount spent by his Department on third party public relations advice, communications advice, online advertising and public awareness campaigns from January 2017 to date in 2018, by year, month and company engaged in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":494,"content":"<p>The detail of my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on all advertising for the period 1 January 2017 - 28 February 2018 is outlined in the table.<\/p><p>My Department did not incur any expenditure on external public relations or communications advice in 2017 or to date in 2018.<\/p><p>Advertising 2017<table><tr><th>Supplier<\/th><th>Month<\/th><th>Brief description (campaign\/event\/project etc.)<\/th><th>Amount<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Mediavest Ltd<\/td><td>30-Jan-17<\/td><td>Recruitment for Junior Cycle for Teachers<\/td><td>&euro;845.05<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mediavest Ltd<\/td><td>30-Jan-17<\/td><td>Recruitment for Junior Cycle for Teachers<\/td><td>&euro;657.26<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mediavest Ltd<\/td><td>30-Jan-17<\/td><td>Recruitment for Junior Cycle for Teachers<\/td><td>&euro;6,069.14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mediavest Ltd<\/td><td>30-Jan-17<\/td><td>Recruitment for Junior Cycle for Teachers<\/td><td>&euro;4,720.43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OPW Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/td><td>07-Feb-17<\/td><td>Iris Advertisement for S.I.

These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.  My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the above, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries and caretakers who are employed using grant funding and to enter an arbitration process.  The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries and caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools  implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation. <\/p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078\/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079\/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.

I discussed some of these matters with the Lithuanian Minister for Education when she visited Ireland earlier this month.<\/p>  <p>  Support for foreign languages begins in primary school.

At junior cycle level, short courses are a new way in which students from immigrant communities can be supported in enhancing their fluency and in developing the range of competences in their home language. My Department's Post Primary Languages Initiative (PPLI) has been working with embassies to develop these courses in students&rsquo; home languages, drawing on guidelines provided by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). Work is currently underway in the development of a 100-hour short course in Lithuanian for junior cycle. This is being progressed by the PPLI in conjunction with the Lithuanian Embassy in Ireland. This course is due to be implemented on a pilot basis in a number of schools from September 2018. <\/p>  <p>  At senior cycle the Foreign Languages Strategy commits to developing and introducing Lithuanian as a curriculum subject.

On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service, so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it.  While certain aspects of the new service model have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue during the second quarter of this year. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure State-wide coverage of GYDP services for young people, (which does not exist at present), the intention is that, in general, service provision will be aligned with Garda Divisions or other appropriate local areas with a distinct community identity as may be agreed during the consultation process.  The consideration of such local arrangements may apply particularly in relation to areas with a large number of potential participants on GYDPs.<\/p>  <p>  However, the provision of GYDP services in all parts of the State has obvious advantages, particularly in terms of providing services for significant numbers of young people who cannot currently access them.  I might add that an independent evaluation report of the operation of an integrated approach to delivery of GYDP services within County Kerry, commissioned by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) is expected shortly.  This report will help with the further development of the full service delivery model, which, as I already mentioned, is still being considered in preparation for the Call for Proposals.<\/p>  <p>  GYDPs provide an effective and essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The principal focus of GYDPs is on young people who receive a Garda caution under the Diversion Programme for involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour and are referred to a local GYDP (primary referrals).  GYDPs also accommodate a certain proportion of young people who are considered to be at risk of involvement in offending or anti-social behaviour (secondary referrals).<\/p>  <p>  In relation to secondary referrals, it has to be considered if, in principle, it is appropriate to refer a child to a Garda project where no criminal act has been identified.  For some, a better option might be referral to available mainstream youth services that could appropriately support them. That being said, it is accepted that referrals to GYDPs must take account of local needs and issues in relation to access and availability of mainstream youth services.  Following the Call for Proposals process, GYDP services will still accommodate a certain proportion of secondary referrals and the proportion of these may vary from area to area depending on identified local needs. <\/p>  <p>  Careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs as part of a wide-ranging consultation process, which is currently ongoing.  This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters.  The consultation process will help to inform further development of the service delivery model in advance of the Call for Proposals being issued, including in relation to the matters referred to by the Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.<\/p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver valuable services for young people who have committed a crime or may be at risk of offending as well as providing important support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level.

The premises was available, decorated to a high standard, capable of delivering the required services, has scope to provide the required communal social areas required by residents and is located close to a town with both primary and secondary schools, shops and a post office.<\/p>  <p>  As with every other accommodation centre in the country,\u00a0my Department\u00a0works closely with the HSE and Departments of\u00a0Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection and all other relevant Government Departments and Agencies to coordinate the delivery of State services to residents. <\/p>  <p>  Contractual discussions with the contractor concluded on Friday 16 February.  On Tuesday 20 February, local politicians and members of the Oireachtas were advised of the development and invited to a meet with RIA staff on the following Friday.  That meeting became a public meeting from which the community\u00a0in Lisdoonvarna submitted two lists of additional queries addressing medical, educational, community and social issues. A full response to those queries has been issued.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that there has been significant interest from the local community in getting involved with the residents of the\u00a0centre through the 'Friends of the Centre' model and my Department will continue to engage with the Friends of the Centre to provide support and address any issues that may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000084#WRT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Transport Data","counter":842,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000084#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":843,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[11830\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000084#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of four wheel drive Garda vehicles in each district in the Dublin metropolitan region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":844,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda vehicles are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in light of his identified operational demands and the availability of resources.

Part of the core work of this group is to ensure that the work being undertaken by relevant Departments is effectively coordinated within Government to ensure maximum effectiveness.  In this context, a discussion is taking place as to where the Office of Internet Safety (OIS), which remains in my Department for the time being, might be located to ensure maximum effectiveness.  The OIS continues to carry out its existing functions which include the coordination in Ireland of the EU Safer Internet Programme with partner bodies that provide<i>inter alia <\/i>awareness raising and hotline functions. <\/p><p>As part of the Government review of this policy area, on 8 March, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently hosted an Open Policy Forum which a number of Departments, including my own, was involved in, and which was attended by a broad range of stakeholders.

I received a report\u00a0from  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0dated 22 September 2017 outlining that 524 cases had been reviewed, 41 of which warranted further investigation and that of those 41,\u00a0twelve cases\u00a0required reclassification.\u00a0 Three of those twelve cases were already classified as homicides but were reclassified from murder to manslaughter or vice versa.  My Department has regularly discussed this issue with senior Garda management\u00a0in the intervening period.<\/p>  <p>  On 5 February last, in the course of a wide ranging meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on policing issues, I was briefed on the issue by\u00a0the\u00a0Acting Commissioner\u00a0and his Senior\u00a0team, including the\u00a0head of\u00a0the\u00a0GSAS.\u00a0 I subsequently met the Chair and CEO of the Policing Authority together with\u00a0senior Garda management\u00a0to discuss the progress made to date in resolving this issue and progress yet to be made.\u00a0 I once again strongly underlined the need to have matters addressed on an urgent priority basis, while acknowledging the labour intensive complex work involved in cases stretching back over many years.\u00a0 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outlined the\u00a0methodology\u00a0of the peer review, and other aspects of the ongoing process,\u00a0to the Policing Authority at their\u00a0last public meeting on 22 February 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The Policing Authority, along with officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, are working with the CSO and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that all incidents of domestic violence are properly recorded.  To this end, I can inform the Deputy that\u00a0a High Level Liaison Group between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the CSO to monitor the quality of crime data for statistical purposes has been established.  The Group is chaired alternately by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0and the CSO at Assistant Commissioner\/Assistant Director General level.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to support the Authority&rsquo;s important work in relation to this matter and I understand that this issue will continue to be examined both in public meetings and in the ongoing work that takes place in between such meetings until the Authority is fully satisfied.  This oversight is appropriate and welcome, as the Policing Authority was established by the Government as an independent body to oversee the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing services in Ireland. Its key objective is to promote trust and confidence in policing and to help shape policing services for Ireland in the future.\u00a0\u00a0I have\u00a0full confidence in the ability of the Authority to do the work with which they are tasked. <\/p>  <p>  I am, of course, concerned about the statements made by the two Garda analysts to the Justice Committee recently; particularly the suggestion that the non-recording or incorrect recording of incidents of domestic violence may put other women in danger and I commend the analysts for their work in identifying these issues.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is committed to preventing and addressing domestic violence in Ireland.  In 2016, Government approved the Second National Strategy on Domestic Sexual and Gender-based Violence with actions aimed at changing societal attitudes through awareness raising to help prevent domestic and sexual violence, improving services to victims and holding perpetrators to account.\u00a0 The strategy commits An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implementing a Risk Assessment Matrix for victims of domestic violence; and to focus on recidivists of domestic violence to prevent and detect crime through early intervention working with organisations supporting victims.  In 2017, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na published its Domestic Abuse Intervention Policy, which places victims at its centre and will enhance the capability of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when dealing with domestic violence.  The policy will inform the training and continuous professional development of Garda&iacute;.<\/p>  <p>  The National Protective Services Bureau has been established, led by a Chief Superintendent as well as the establishment of a nationwide network of Garda Victim Services Offices with dedicated staff in each of the 28 Garda Divisions . The National Garda Services Bureau is tasked with improving services to victims, improving the investigation of sexual and domestic violence incidents, and identifying and managing risk.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised that it is\u00a0intended to establish Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs) in each Garda Division, mirroring the responsibilities held by the National Protected Services Bureau.  This has been rolled out on a phased basis starting with 3 Divisions - Louth, Dublin Metropolitan Region West and Cork City.  The next phase of DPSUs have provisionally been identified and will be launched in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000086#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Oversight","counter":929,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000086#WRV02500"},{"type":"question","counter":930,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[12300\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000086#WRV02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to establish a statutory responsibility on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and his Department to make requested data available to the oversight bodies in a timely manner and to strengthen the requirement to proactively provide information to the oversight bodies in circumstances in which it has information relevant to the performance of their functions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":931,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, (&quot;the Act&quot;)\u00a0makes provision for the establishment of a number of oversight bodies for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, sets out the functions and powers of those bodies and also sets out the obligations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of those bodies, including in relation to data that may be required by those bodies.

The expert oversight by the CSO of crime statistics in line with best international\u00a0practice ensures that the public\u00a0can have confidence in\u00a0the data which informs the development of effective policies by my department.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated a review of homicide classifications, initially for the period 2013-2015 but later extended the review to cover the period from 2003-2017.<\/p>  <p>  This is obviously a complex process which takes considerable time\u00a0but it is important that both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the CSO are confident that their data is robust and accurate.  While the review is underway, the CSO has suspended the publication of quarterly crime statistics, with the most recent published figures\u00a0being for Q4 2016.  I am informed that the review team includes two experts from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service\u00a0(GSAS) who appeared before the Joint\u00a0Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality recently.  The review is not yet complete, however the details will be made public by AGS on completion.<\/p>  <p>  I have already outlined my concern about reports that unlawful deaths were not properly investigated.  Any substantiated allegations of this kind would be very serious and a cause of serious public concern.  The issue that has arisen in respect of homicide classification is complex and it is essential to clearly establish the facts.<\/p>  <p>  On 5 February last, in the course of a wide ranging meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on policing issues, I was briefed on the issue by the\u00a0Acting Commissioner\u00a0and his Senior\u00a0team, including the\u00a0head of\u00a0the\u00a0Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service.  I subsequently met the Chair and CEO of the Policing Authority together with\u00a0senior Garda management to discuss the progress made to date in resolving this issue and progress yet to be made.  I strongly underlined the need to have matters addressed on an urgent priority basis, while acknowledging the labour intensive complex work involved in cases stretching back over many years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outlined the\u00a0methodology\u00a0of the peer review, and other aspects of the ongoing process,\u00a0to the Policing Authority at their\u00a0last public meeting on 22 February 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to support the Authority&rsquo;s important work in relation to this matter and I understand that this issue will continue to be examined both in public meetings and in the ongoing work that takes place in between such meetings until the Authority is fully satisfied.  This oversight is appropriate and welcome, as the Policing Authority was established by the Government as an independent body to oversee the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing services in Ireland.  Its key objective is to promote trust and confidence in policing and to help shape policing services for Ireland in the future.  I have\u00a0full confidence in the ability of the Authority to do the work with which they are tasked.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, I have requested a report from the Garda authorities on the matter and I will revert to her directly when a response has been received.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000087#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":957,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000087#WRW00800"},{"type":"question","counter":958,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[12374\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000087#WRW00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when Garda recruits that have had their final interview will be called for a medical examination; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":959,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 2013 and, as Minister, I have no direct involvement in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Rather, the Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of the Garda Commissioner, manages the initial recruitment stage for selection of Garda Trainees with the final stages of the process, in which candidates are vetted, complete a physical competency test and a medical examination, being managed by the Commissioner.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that the PAS notifies the Appointments Office in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when applicants have been informed of their success following the initial recruitment stage.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Cavan \/Monaghan Division on 31 January 2018, the latest date for which information is currently available, was 329.  There are also 11 Garda Reserves and 38 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that there is close and ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI on all aspects of policing, with a particular focus on combatting security threats and cross-border crime.  The Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI, who are responsible for operational policing cooperation, have repeatedly emphasised the scope and the value of the close and high quality cooperation between the two police services in combatting crime, protecting community safety and saving lives.  The two police services operate a joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy which has as its aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland, to disrupt criminal activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom, I am advised by the Commissioner, 53\u00a0have been assigned to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College.  Also a further 600 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cavan\/Monaghan Division.<\/p>  <p>  Appointments to the rank of Inspector are a matter for the Commissioner under section 14 of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner that the overall strength of the Inspector rank was 264 as of 31\u00a0January 2018 with 7 allocated to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division.  I am further advised by the Commissioner that there is currently a competition in train for promotion to the rank of Inspector with the aim of bringing the strength to 300 as agreed under the Employment Control Framework.  I am assured by the Commissioner that following completion of this competition the needs of all Garda Divisions including the Cavan\/Monaghan Divisions will be fully considered when determining the allocation of Garda Inspectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000087#WRW04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wards of Court","counter":990,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000087#WRW04400"},{"type":"question","counter":991,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[12692\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000087#WRW04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Exchequer is obliged to make up the shortfall in circumstances in which there is a loss to the funds of Wards of Court.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":992,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, wardship funds are not public funds and are subject to the control and supervision of the High Court and the question of Exchequer intervention in the scenario suggested by the Deputy does not arise.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that\u00a0it is\u00a0standard procedure for funds of\u00a0Wards of Court\u00a0to be brought under the custody of the court for investment by the Accountant of the Courts of Justice in accordance with the directions of the President of the High Court and the Registrar of the Office of Wards of Court.

My colleague, Minister Breen, attended the most recent meetings of the Council on 30th November 2017 and 12th March 2018.  State Aid rules did not feature on the agenda of these meetings.  The Competitiveness Council is a consultative committee and is not a forum for direct representations from Member States.  Nor does the Committee propose changes to State Aid rules.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit was a central part of the discussions at meetings my predecessor, the then T&aacute;naiste Frances Fitzgerald, had with both EU Commissioners and Ministers from other Member States.  This included a meeting with the EU&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Negotiator, Michel Barnier, in July 2017, where the difficulties Ireland was facing as a result of Brexit were discussed.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2017, the then T&aacute;naiste met with Commissioner Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition who has responsibility for EU State aid policy to discuss, amongst other things, the impact of Brexit on Irish businesses.  An outcome from this meeting was the establishment of a Working Group comprising representatives from DG Competition, the Department of Business, Enterprise&amp;amp; Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  The Working Group has met three times and in between these meetings, there has been engagement on specific issues in order to continue to progress matters.  The next meeting of the Group is due to take place within the next month.  Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State Aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Working Group discussions.  It will not, however, be an item for discussion at the State Aid Working Group meeting on 27th April 2018 as the mandate of the Group is to discuss best practice, share information and knowledge etc.  It is not a policy forum.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is carrying out extensive work to prepare for all Brexit eventualities.  Informed by detailed research, my Department is putting in place a package of measures that will allow us to respond to the needs of businesses including the Brexit Loan Scheme which was announced in Budget 2018 which will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future. <\/p>  <p>  The recent signing of the counter guarantee from the EIB group (through its InnovFin Guarantee) means that the &euro;24 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) can be leveraged to provide a fund of &euro;300 million.  The Brexit Loan Scheme, which will be launched in the 28th of March, will be open to businesses of fewer than 500 employees which can demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit.  They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy demonstrating that they plan to innovate or adapt in response to Brexit. This scheme will be operated within De Minimis State Aid Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  My officials are also examining policy proposals for a new longer-term Business Investment Loan Scheme to support businesses to invest strategically for a post-Brexit environment and a new Business Finance Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development.   <\/p>  <p>  The Agencies of my Department are at the forefront in working with firms to ensure they are equipped to deal with Brexit and to enhance their performances in an increasingly competitive global trading environment through lean programmes, skills development and reducing business costs.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) has launched the 'Brexit SME Scorecard', an interactive online tool which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  EI is also offering a 'Be Prepared Grant' of up to &euro;5,000 to support clients to develop a Brexit Action Plan and it continues to support clients to improve their competitiveness, acquire new markets and enhance management skills. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are organising workshops, seminars and training to assist companies to better understand the challenges of Brexit and have a range of supports to help clients to respond to those challenges, to become more competitive and to source new markets.  <\/p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland is also working to minimise the impact of Brexit on north-south trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000089#WRY04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Applications","counter":1097,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000090#WRZZZZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1098,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[12329\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000090#WRZZZZ00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) under the critical skills permit.","asker":"1276","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1099,"content":"<p>An application for a Critical Skills Employment Permit for the person concerned was received on 1st February 2018.

Given the volume of spending, it is essential that a strategic approach is adopted and value for money is achieved.  <\/p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement was set up in 2014 to develop a more professional approach to procurement and to drive fair, transparent and open competition in the market place. My colleague Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, Minister of State at the Departments of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for public procurement through the Office of Government Procurement. <\/p>  <p>  Public procurement offers a very sizeable market to businesses in Ireland.  Facilitating more Irish businesses, in particular SMEs, in winning opportunities within the State and in other States helps to create jobs in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2015 published in September 2017 shows that 94% of the State's expenditure is with firms within the State and that 52% of the State's expenditure is with SMEs.  In any competitive process, there will be more losers than winners - that is the nature of competition.  Such competition, however, can help make businesses healthier and more competitive.<\/p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the OGP and with key stakeholders to ensure that the challenges faced by SMEs in accessing public procurement are acknowledged and addressed.  Given that SMEs represent over 98% of our enterprise base, it is essential that the right supports are in place to assist SMEs to grow their business.<\/p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the OGP, a small number of representations [and reports] have been received by my Department and Enterprise Ireland in relation to SME access to public procurement and the impact of decisions made by the OGP on small and medium enterprises.  Any specific issue has been raised bilaterally with the OGP. Since the establishment of the OGP, a number of supports and initiatives have been implemented to remove the real or perceived barriers for SMEs to public procurement. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is represented on the High Level Group (HLG) on SME Access to Public Procurement.  The HLG consists of representatives from my Department, the OGP, Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland (ITI).  The focus of this group is to develop policies to support SMEs in accessing public procurement opportunities, and increase awareness and understanding of the public procurement process.<\/p>  <p>  An SME Working Group, was established as a means of engaging with industry representative bodies to support SME access to public procurement and address any issues that are raised by SMEs regarding public procurement.  Membership includes ISME, SFA, Ibec, Chambers, CIF, the OGP, DBEI, EI and ITI.  <\/p>  <p>  A Communication Strategy Subgroup, chaired by the OGP, was established in 2017 to work in partnership with industry representative bodies to improve understanding and awareness of public procurement in the target supplier community.  A programme of workshops are underway as part of the Communications Strategy and a suite of explanatory animated videos has been developed to bring public procurement opportunities to a wider audience. <\/p>  <p>  Specific measures to support SME participation in public procurement opportunities include:<\/p>  <p>  -supports provided by Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland to assist SMEs in preparing for public tenders, including events to foster awareness and encourage engagement such as Meet the Buyer events and Go2Tender events.  For example, Enterprise Ireland hosted a Meet the Buyer event for the Social Housing PPP Bundle 1 on 14 March this year at which over 300 companies, mainly SMEs, had the opportunity to meet the construction and maintenance contractors tendering for the project; <\/p>  <p>  -encouraging businesses to register on eTenders, The National Procurement Portal- set up by the OGP to advertise all procurement opportunities and to facilitate suppliers to register their interest in upcoming opportunities;<\/p>  <p>  -the establishment of a Tender Advisory service to assist SMEs during the tender process<\/p>  <p>  -Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) - procurement which seeks an innovative solution to specific public sector challenges and needs. (ie- Enterprise Ireland, SEAI and ESB eCars competition to develop smart technology solution to parking charges for electric cars);<\/p>  <p>  -setting proportionate eligibility requirements, e.g. turnover and insurance; <\/p>  <p>  -breaking tendering competitions into lots, e.g. by sector, region, value;<\/p>  <p>  - Guidelines for Consortium Bidding, issued by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission as a resource to SMEs in accessing public procurement tenders.  <\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken by Government Departments and agencies in recent years, including close consultation with SME representative bodies, to improve awareness of the opportunities available in public procurement and to develop improved tendering skills for businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  It is clear that there are enormous opportunities out there for SMEs. My Department and Agencies will continue to work with the OGP to enhance the supports that are there to help SMEs succeed in this space. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000090#WRZZZZ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IDA Ireland Site Visits","counter":1108,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000090#WRZZZZ00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1109,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[12678\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000090#WRZZZZ01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of site visits conducted by IDA Ireland in counties Cavan and Monaghan in each of the past three years; and the number of these visits that were to locations in the two county towns and other areas of the counties, respectively in tabular form.","asker":"1271","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":1110,"content":"<p>IDA Ireland continues to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in all of our regions, including in counties Cavan and Mongahan.<\/p><p>Site visits do represent an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that overseas firms consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland.

These guidelines were devised by experts in transgender healthcare, along with members of the International Transgender, Transsexual and LGBT community.<\/p>  <p>  A proposed model of care for transgender children, adolescents and adults was submitted by the HSE Quality Improvement Division to the HSE Divisions of Primary Care, Mental Health and Acute Hospital programme.  The model was developed in consultation with key treating clinicians, planners, policy makers, advocates and service users.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines recommend a comprehensive multidisciplinary psychosocial assessment prior to commencement of hormone therapy by endocrinology services.  The assessment focuses on more than just assessment for the possible diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria.  The guidelines highlight several criteria which must be met prior to referral for hormonal intervention. It is important that co-morbid conditions are identified and addressed, and that people access the supports that they need to manage co-morbid difficulties, which can impact on response to medical transition (including hormone treatment).<\/p>  <p>  International best practice involves an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team and shared decision making in the best interests of the individual.  Both WPATH and the Endocrine Society Guidelines 2017 specify the assessment must be carried out by a mental health professional (s) with experience in transgender healthcare and possess specific skills.  Endocrinologists and General Practitioners, GPs, do not possess these skills, and require access to the multidisciplinary team as described.  GPs would only see a small number of gender variant individuals during their lifetime in clinical practice, and would not be in a position to build up the requisite skillset outlined in WPATH and Endocrine Society Guidelines or have the time resource to conduct a comprehensive evaluation.<\/p>  <p>  Informed consent is essential, whereby benefits and risks of hormone treatment and surgery are discussed with individuals seeking these interventions.  Although regret rates are low, it can happen and can also lead to high levels of psychological distress. Healthcare providers work with people to try to prevent negative outcomes.  The emerging evidence on good outcomes following medical and\/or surgical transitioning is based on use of multi-disciplinary psychosocial assessment, fulfilment of criteria for hormones and on-going psychological support throughout the process.  It is important that psychological support is available to individuals before, during and after transitioning.<\/p>  <p>  Prescription of hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones for transgender people is relatively new.  Significant side effects can occur with cross sex hormones including irreversible physical changes and infertility.  There is a lack of long-term research on outcomes.  For these reasons the decision to prescribe should only be made by specialists, i.e.  Endocrinologists, in consultation with other professionals involved in the assessment process.   Shared decision-making is in accordance with best practice internationally.  Prescriptions can then be supported by local GPs with specialist guidance.<\/p>  <p>  The model of care is providing the framework for the development of National Gender Clinics and MDTs for children and adults, funded by the Acute Hospitals and Mental Health Divisions of the HSE.  Recruitment will commence to develop these national teams in 2018. It is envisaged that these National Teams will be in place in 2018, pending successful recruitment campaigns.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE, across a number of programmes including mental health, acute hospitals, primary care and social inclusion, is committed to building services for this community in accordance with International Best Practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000091#WRAA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Data","counter":1177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000091#WRAA02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1178,"qnumday":427,"qnumall":"[11782\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000091#WRAA02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in each LHO that are waiting for hormone replacement therapy; and the number waiting less than one year, one to two years and more than two years for same.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1179,"content":"<p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000091#WRAA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1180,"content":"<p>Question No. 428 answered with Question No. 425.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Training","counter":1181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000091#WRAA03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1182,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[11784\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000091#WRAA03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if general practitioner education on transgender healthcare will be rolled out nationwide.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1183,"content":"<p>The Irish College General Practitioners, ICGP, is the professional body for general practice in Ireland and is responsible for post graduate specialist medical education, training and research in the specialty of general practice.<\/p><p>The ICGP&rsquo;s curriculum for general practice training involves teaching trainees to: <\/p><p>- Recognise that patients are diverse;<\/p><p>- Initiate systems to make the GP practice approachable to all women including for lesbian, bisexual and transgender patients; <\/p><p>- Describe the health needs of gay, transgender and bisexual men, beyond sexual health, and their partners;<\/p><p>- Acknowledge the role of the GP in gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender health care.<\/p><p>The ICGP also provides continuous medical education to General Practitioners in the form of journals, e-learning, quick reference guides, small group meetings and conferences.

The recommendations of the National Plan, published in 2014, apply to all age groups within the population but in particular for children.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017 the Department published a progress report on the National Rare Disease Plan and this is available on the Department&rsquo;s website under &lsquo;Publications&rsquo;.  An update is provided on all 48 recommendations of the Plan and on progress to date.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases\u00a0 was one of the principal recommendations in the Plan.\u00a0 The Programme is responsible for assisting with mapping and developing care pathways for rare diseases; facilitating timely access to centres of expertise- nationally and internationally; and developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In line with the National Rare Diseases Plan, the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health, encouraged designated centres of expertise in Ireland to apply for membership of European Reference Networks, ERNs, during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks. Three of these centres are now represented on ERN network.<\/p>  <p>  Membership of ERNs will bring opportunities for engaging in research relating to Rare Diseases in keeping with the National Rare Diseases Plan. Further centres are expected to apply for membership or affiliated membership of ERNs when the next call takes place in early 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office, NRDO, was a key recommendation of the Rare Disease plan.\u00a0 The office provides current and reliable information about rare diseases to the general public, health care professionals, researchers and policy makers. The National Rare Diseases Office is responsible for updating Orphanet Ireland. Orphanet is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU. The office also manages the National Rare Diseases Information Line, freephone service, and provides online information about rare diseases on their website.<\/p>  <p>  A number of recommendations about access to appropriate drugs and technologies were contained in the plan. One chief recommendation in this regard refers to the HSE developing a Working Group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies; and that the approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the National Cancer Control Programme. The HSE Acute Hospitals Division has developed the terms of reference, required membership and reporting relationship for this committee.\u00a0 A Chairperson has now been identified and it is expected that the Group will convene in early 2018.<\/p>  <p>  One of the recommendations of the National Plan for Rare Diseases was that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published.\u00a0 The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.\u00a0 The Individual Health Identifier part of the project is now being implemented by the HSE. A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals. The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.\u00a0 The National Rare Diseases Office developed eLearning modules for healthcare professionals. These modules are available on HSE website.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of rare diseases and of the creation of an all-island patient register has been raised in the context of on-going discussions at North-South meetings. It is also anticipated that the Model of Care for Rare Diseases will set out recommendations for rare disease registries.

These guidelines were devised by experts in transgender healthcare, along with members of the International Transgender, Transsexual and LGBT community.<\/p>  <p>  A proposed model of care for transgender children, adolescents and adults was submitted by the HSE Quality Improvement Division to the HSE Divisions of Primary Care, Mental Health and Acute Hospital programme. The model was developed in consultation with key treating clinicians, planners, policy makers, advocates and service users.<\/p>  <p>  The guidelines recommend a comprehensive multidisciplinary psychosocial assessment prior to commencement of hormone therapy by endocrinology services. The assessment focuses on more than just assessment for the possible diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria.  The guidelines highlight several criteria which must be met prior to referral for hormonal intervention. It is important that co-morbid conditions are identified and addressed, and that people access the supports that they need to manage co-morbid difficulties, which can impact on response to medical transition (including hormone treatment).<\/p>  <p>  International best practice involves an assessment by a multi-disciplinary team and shared decision making in the best interests of the individual. Both WPATH and the Endocrine Society Guidelines 2017 specify the assessment must be carried out by a mental health professional (s) with experience in transgender healthcare and possess specific skills. Endocrinologists and General Practitioners (GPs) do not possess these skills, and require access to the multidisciplinary team as described.  GPs would only see a small number of gender variant individuals during their lifetime in clinical practice, and would not be in a position to build up the requisite skill set outlined in WPATH and Endocrine Society Guidelines or have the time resource to conduct a comprehensive evaluation.<\/p>  <p>  Informed consent is essential, whereby benefits and risks of hormone treatment and surgery are discussed with individuals seeking these interventions.  Although regret rates are low, it can happen and can also lead to high levels of psychological distress. Healthcare providers work with people to try to prevent negative outcomes.  The emerging evidence on good outcomes following medical and\/or surgical transitioning is based on use of multi-disciplinary psychosocial assessment, fulfilment of criteria for hormones and on-going psychological support throughout the process.  It is important that psychological support is available to individuals before, during and after transitioning.<\/p>  <p>  Prescription of hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones for transgender people is relatively new.  Significant side effects can occur with cross sex hormones including irreversible physical changes and infertility.  There is a lack of long-term research on outcomes. For these reasons the decision to prescribe should only be made by specialists (i.e. Endocrinologists) in consultation with other professionals involved in the assessment process.

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  This position remains unchanged.<\/p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis. Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000099#WRJJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Availability","counter":1582,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000099#WRJJ04000"},{"type":"question","counter":1583,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[12431\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000099#WRJJ04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when mepacrine will be reinstated for persons with medical cards who rely on it for treatment of skin disease in view of the fact that it can cost &euro;200 per month; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[12432\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000099#WRJJ04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medicine will be made available to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1585,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 569 and 570 together.<\/p><p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000099#WRJJ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Insurance Cover","counter":1587,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000100#WRKK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1588,"qnumday":571,"qnumall":"[12433\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000100#WRKK00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding private health insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1589,"content":"<p>Our health insurance system is voluntary and community rated.\u00a0 Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) was introduced in May 2015 to encourage people to join the private health insurance market at an earlier age and thus avoid late entry loadings of 2% per annum which may apply at age 35 and older.\u00a0 There was a grace period available up until introduction, during which time health insurance could be purchased (at any age) without incurring loadings.

One of the key priorities for the HSE is to improve waiting times for therapy services by implementing a revised model of care for children&rsquo;s Speech and Language Therapy services and Psychology services and develop new models for Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy services.\u00a0 The HSE has established a Service Improvement Initiative to include Occupational Therapy services, with a particular focus on waiting times for access.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years).  The objective of the new model of assessment and intervention is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children (0-18s), irrespective of their disability, where they live or the school they attend.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Evidence to date from areas where this has been rolled out shows that implementation of this programme will have a positive impact on waiting lists both for assessments and therapies.  Some HSE Areas have already reconfigured into interdisciplinary Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams (a total of 56 networks of the 129 network teams required are in place) whilst others are developing their reconfiguration and implementation plan.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has also recognises that a lack of standardisation and clarity has contributed to significant delays in the Assessment of Need process.\u00a0 In addition, the Assessment of Need has resulted in resources being targeted almost exclusively towards assessment with some children receiving very limited intervention.<\/p>  <p>  A revised Standard Operating Procedure for Assessment of Need has been developed to ensure that there is a standardised approach to assessment across all areas.  This procedure will be implemented from 1 April 2018.  The procedure addresses the issue of eligibility for Assessment of Need and aligns this with the National Policy on Access to Services for Children &amp;amp; Young People with Disability &amp;amp; Developmental Delay.  <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the Standard Operating Procedure for Assessment of Need is intended to support children with disabilities to access timely assessment and appropriate intervention.<\/p>  <p>  At a national level, &euro;8 million in additional funding was invested in 2014 and 2015 to fund 200 additional posts to support the implementation of the Progressing Disabilities programme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A further &euro;4 million in additional funding was provided for 75 therapy posts in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 funding will facilitate the recruitment of additional occupational therapy posts to address waiting lists and enable patients to have earlier access to assessment and treatment.  <\/p>  <p>  It is expected that this re-configuration of services along with\u00a0 other measures outlined will have a significant impact on the HSE&rsquo;s ability to meet the needs of children and young people in a more efficient, effective and equitable manner.

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.

Vaccination is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of all health care interventions.  The HSE launched their influenza immunisation campaign for winter 2017-18 on 2 October 2017.<\/p><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) organises consultations twice annually with an advisory group of experts to analyse influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, and issues recommendations on the composition of the influenza vaccines for the following influenza season.  These recommendations are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines.<\/p><p>The influenza vaccine purchased by HSE is based on WHO advice on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2017\/8 northern hemisphere influenza season, issued on 2 March 2017.  It is recommended that trivalent vaccines for use in the 2017-2018 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:<\/p><p>-  an A\/Michigan\/45\/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus,<\/p><p>-  an A\/Hong Kong\/4801\/2014 (H3N2)-like virus; and<\/p><p>-  a B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008-like virus.<\/p><p>This season (2017\/18) the HSE procured the trivalent inactivated Influenza vaccine (Split Virion) BP seasonal influenza vaccine for all those in the recommended at risk groups, health care workers, and carers.  The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe.<\/p><p>The 2017\/2018 influenza season is unusual because of the high levels of Influenza B strains in circulation.  The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe but has limited protection for the Influenza B strains.<\/p><p>The WHO issued its recommendation for the composition of influenza vaccines for the 2018-2019 northern hemisphere influenza season on 22 February 2018.  It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines contain the following:<\/p><p>-  an A\/Michigan\/45\/2015(H1N1)pdm09-like virus;<\/p><p>-  an A\/Singapore\/INFIMH-16-0019\/2016 (H3N2)-like virus; <\/p><p>-  a B\/Colorado\/06\/2017-likevirus (B\/Victoria\/2\/87 lineage); and<\/p><p>-  a B\/Phuket\/3073\/2013-likevirus (B\/Yamagata\/16\/88 lineage).<\/p><p>It also recommended that the influenza B virus component of trivalent vaccines for use in the 2018-2019 northern hemisphere influenza season be a B\/Colorado\/06\/2017-like virus of the B\/Victoria\/2\/87-lineage.<\/p><p>The HSE National Immunisation Office and HSE Procurement are responsible for the purchase of influenza vaccine.  To ensure vaccine supply, this tender process must be completed 9 months in advance of the first delivery into Ireland at the end of August.  The HSE has already completed and awarded the tender for seasonal influenza vaccine for 2018\/19 at a cost of &euro;3.2- 4 million (depending on whether contingency doses are procured).<\/p><p>The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC), an independent committee which makes recommendations on vaccination policy in Ireland.  NIAC is considering the need to expand the current recommendations for influenza vaccine, including the potential community wide benefit of extending recommendations to include all children.  The 2018-19 seasonal influenza programme will be in accordance with NIAC recommendations.<\/p><p>While there was a focus was on influenza immunisation, additional measures put in place this year included:<\/p><p>-  A national flu planning steering group which meets weekly is in place. <\/p><p>-  There is a flu lead in each Public Health Department, who liaises with Community Health Organisation (CHO)and Hospital Group (HG) flu planning groups.<\/p><p>-  Digital advertising and promotions target at risk groups, the over 65s, pregnant women and healthcare workers.<\/p><p>-  The Director General has asked each HG and associated CHO to produce a Winter Plan which includes a specific section on Flu.<\/p><p>-  The Flu Medication Protocol has been revised.<\/p><p>The HSE also put in place additional measures to ensure that it was in a position to identify and react to any significant increase in health service demand.

Similarly, it recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, it proposes an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.<\/p>  <p>  The model consists of three care pathways - supported, assisted and specialised.  The Supported Care Pathway is intended for normal-risk mothers and babies, with midwives leading and delivering care within a multidisciplinary framework.  Care will be delivered by the community midwifery team, with most antenatal and postnatal care being provided in the community and home settings.  The Strategy makes it clear that women should be offered choice regarding their preferred pathway of care, in line with their clinical needs and best practice.<\/p>  <p>  The phased implementation of the Strategy is being led by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.  To this end, the Programme has developed a detailed Implementation Plan which seeks to ensure that each Maternity Network\/Hospital Group will have all three care pathways in place and operational in 2018.  The Plan also provides that by early 2019, a minimum of 20% of pregnant women presenting at our maternity hospitals\/units will have access to the supported care pathway.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, &euro;4.15 million additional funding has been allocated for the implementation of the Strategy, and the establishment of community midwifery teams has been prioritised in\u00a0the HSE Service Plan.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.\u00a0 The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.\u00a0The proposals seek to ensure that: <\/p>  <p>  -  There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  -  There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  -  Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  -  The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.\u00a0 Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,\u00a0 no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.\u00a0 Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges.

Because the storm occurred at this time of year it proved particularly disruptive as farmers coped with challenging weather conditions alongside the normal busy workload of Spring: calving and lambing and winter feeding.  The key on-farm challenges revolved around preventing the freezing up of water supplies at a critical time for lactating animals, the provision of fodder and shelter to stock against the worst of the snowfall and dangerous conditions for farmyards and environs.  Delayed turn-out of some stock is increasing the demand for fodder and accommodation.  In this regard it should be noted that the targeted, localised scheme to provide a subsidy for long distance transport of fodder is open and available to farmers affected by fodder shortages in the West and North West of the country.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout this period and immediately afterwards Department staff together with Teagasc worked at local level to ensure that the farming community had access to the best advice on how to cope with the numerous issues thrown up by the storm.  To support those in more immediate difficulties the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine emergency phone line for animal welfare issues remained open and attended at all times.  All requests for support were responded to.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the significant assistance the farming community provided within the wider local community at this busy time as they looked in on neighbours, cleared roads and helped to restore access to more remote rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  At dairy sector level my Department worked closely with all stakeholders and with industry to minimise disruption to critical activities including milk collection services.

It is important to emphasise that public support cannot be provided for insurable risks.<\/p>  <p>  In order to respond where possible to the issue of structural damage I believe that it is appropriate to recognise supports already available through current on-farm investment support schemes operated by my Department and I have asked my officials to examine these in the context of Storm Emma as a matter of urgency. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Aid","counter":1992,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1993,"qnumday":709,"qnumall":"[12301\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he requested the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to submit proposals for changing the state aid thresholds at EU level ahead of the next state aid modernisation working group meeting which takes place here on 27 April 2018; and his plans to protect Irish enterprises, exporting companies and related jobs from a hard Brexit WTO scenario and other negative trading scenarios as outlined in the recent Copenhagen economics report.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1994,"qnumday":710,"qnumall":"[12302\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will request at European level changes to state aid thresholds at EU level in order to protect Irish enterprises, exporting companies and related jobs from a hard Brexit WTO scenario following the EU Council's draft guidelines published on 7 March 2018 in which it confirmed that due to the UK&rsquo;s position of refusing customs union and single market solutions the UK is hurtling towards third country status; and if he has made this request to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1995,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 709 and 710 together.<\/p>  <p>  Brexit poses enormous challenges for the agri-food and fisheries sectors by virtue of their exposure to the UK market, as confirmed by numerous studies, including by the ESRI, Department of Finance and, most recently, by Copenhagen Economics.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I and my Department have been engaging extensively with these sectors\u00a0since the UK Referendum vote through my Department&rsquo;s Stakeholder Consultative Committee, the All-Island Civic Dialogue process and ongoing bilateral contacts.

The Beef Data and Genomics\u00a0Programme (BDGP) is the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides Irish beef farmers with some 300 million euro in funding over the current Rural Development Programme (RDP) period.  This scheme, which was introduced in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 EU Regulation 1305\/2013, is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.  So far under this programme approximately 135 million euro has been paid out to farmers and this Government will continue to support this programme through the lifetime of the current RDP.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to existing funding, under Pillar II of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) my Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the 4 billion euro Rural Development Programme (RDP), 2014 - 2020.  In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler farmers under Pillar II of the CAP include GLAS, ANCs and Knowledge Transfer Groups.  Suckler farmer also benefit from the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and Greening payments under CAP Pillar I.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to any potential funding over and above existing supports to farmers under the current CAP, I again stress:<\/p>  <p>  There are no surplus funds available within the RDP above and beyond the funding already allocated, which has been committed to existing schemes within the RDP.  Therefore, any additional supports under the RDP would require cuts to other RDP schemes and \/or additional exchequer funding.\u00a0 RDP schemes, including the existing BDGP are based on costs incurred and income foregone by participants.  Every scheme, or scheme adjustment, under the RDP must be justified and approved by the European Commission on the basis of additional actions and income foregone by farmers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Any allocation of funding under Pillar I of the CAP for a coupled payment would in principle require a linear reduction to all existing farmers Basic Payment Scheme payments for redistribution. <\/p>  <p>  I am not of the view that taking already committed money from farmers under the CAP is an appropriate means by which to support suckler farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Any attempt to introduce a fully exchequer funded scheme would require approval by the European Commission under State Aid regulations and would need to comply with our obligations under WTO rules.  The introduction of such an additional scheme funded directly from exchequer funds, would in any event not be possible under the current budgetary resources available to my Department. <\/p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with\u00a0ensuring Irish beef has access to as many markets as possible, both for live animals and processed beef, is the most appropriate way to support the continued development of the sector.  This sector\u00a0according to the Teagasc National Farm survey for 2016 received support equivalent to approximately 500 euro per suckler cow.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible, post 2020.  In particular, I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP post 2020.  However my strong view is that any such payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability, and the economic and environmental efficiency, of their farming system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Expenditure","counter":2005,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS02300"},{"type":"question","counter":2006,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[12392\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 411 of 8 March 2018, the expected budgeted spend for the TAMS scheme in 2016 and 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2007,"content":"<p>As outlined in the previous PQs (number\u00a011062\/18 and 11063\/18\u00a0of 8 March 2018)\u00a0the actual spend for TAMS II was &euro;3.9m for\u00a02016\u00a0and the actual spend in 2017 was\u00a0&euro;31.3m. \u00a0The respective budget allocations\u00a0were &euro;28m for 2016\u00a0and &euro;50m for 2017. <\/p><p>Payments cannot issue until the approved works have been completed and a payment claim is submitted by or on behalf of the approved applicant to the online system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff","counter":2008,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2009,"qnumday":715,"qnumall":"[12394\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000108#WRSS02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the delays that are occurring in recruitment and placement of technical agricultural officers in the eastern region; the reasons for such delays; the steps being taken to address this issue in order that the industry is not restricted in its daily activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2010,"content":"<p>The competition for the role of Technical Agricultural Officer is being administered by the Public Appointments Service on behalf\u00a0my Department.

As part of his appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, he spoke of acceptable cuts to CAP and Cohesion of 5 - 10%.  This was in the\u00a0context of some Member States looking for cuts in these programme of up to\u00a030%. <\/p>  <p>  These figures must be seen\u00a0in the context of\u00a0the European Commission's own Reflection\u00a0Paper on the Future of EU Finances which was published on the 14 February 2018.

The key on-farm challenges revolved around preventing the freezing up of water supplies at a critical time for lactating animals, the provision of fodder and shelter to stock against the worst of the snowfall and dangerous conditions for farmyards and environs.  Delayed turn-out of some stock is increasing the demand for fodder and accommodation.  While recognising that the recent bad weather has impacted on the commencement of Spring grass growth in many areas of the country, I am satisfied that\u00a0adequate quantities of fodder remain currently available\u00a0in the country at present.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout this period and immediately afterwards Department staff, together with Teagasc worked at local level to ensure that the farming community had access to the best advice on how to cope with the numerous issues thrown up by the storm.  To support those in more immediate difficulties the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine emergency phone line for animal welfare issues remained open and attended at all times.  All requests for support were responded to.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the significant assistance the farming community provided within the wider local community at this busy time as they looked in on neighbours, cleared roads and helped to restore access to more remote rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  At sector level my Department worked closely with all stakeholders and with industry to minimise disruption to critical activities including milk collection services.  I am happy to be able to report that such major issues were dealt with in the shortest possible time thanks to the coordinated efforts of farmers, industry and my own Department staff.<\/p>  <p>  As the storm abated and the sector slowly returned to normal it became clear that the main problem centred on damage to horticulture and other on-farm structures.  Such structures will principally be insured and it is important that insurance companies respond rapidly and flexibly to the needs of their farmers customers.  It is important to emphasise that public support cannot be provided for insurable risks.<\/p>  <p>  In order to respond where possible to the issue of structural damage I believe that it is appropriate to recognise supports available through current on-farm investment support schemes operated by my Department and I have asked my officials to examine these in the context of Storm Emma as a matter of urgency.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000109#WRTT04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":2079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000109#WRTT04500"},{"type":"question","counter":2080,"qnumday":739,"qnumall":"[12602\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000109#WRTT04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if payments to farmers will be expedited in line with the terms of GLAS in view of the fact that over 700 farmers in County Galway are awaiting for GLAS payments since October 2017 and in further view of the harsh weather and the effect on farm income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2081,"content":"<p>The overriding factor in the processing of all EU funded schemes is to ensure that all regulatory requirements are respected in issuing payments. <\/p>  <p>  5,429 participants in County Galway\u00a0have now received a 2017 advance payment.  489 cases continue to be processed, including when\u00a0outstanding documentation is received from participants.

In a border context, and in terms of mitigating the impact in counties Monaghan and Cavan, the UK commitment in the Joint EU-UK Report of last December to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland is extremely important.  The Government has insisted that this commitment be translated into legal form in the Withdrawal Agreement, and we are currently working closely with our EU counterparts and the European Commission Task Force to ensure that the necessary legal provisions are incorporated. <\/p>  <p>  We will also continue to work with them on the inclusion of transitional arrangements, and on agreeing guidelines that will underpin the forthcoming discussions on the framework for the future EU-UK relationship.  On Thursday last I met with my UK counterpart, Secretary of State Michael Gove , and stressed the importance of facilitating bilateral trade post Brexit, without undermining the Single Market. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Government has continued to introduce a range of measures to help the agri-food sector navigate the short-term impacts of Brexit.  In Budget 2017, I introduced measures to help reduce farm gate business costs, including a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I also announced a &euro;50m Brexit support package, which will comprise a number of initiatives.  Firstly, in cooperation with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I am establishing a new Brexit Loan Scheme aimed at providing affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future. The Scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses (up to 499 employees), at least 40% of which will be available to food businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also considering the development of a separate loan scheme in 2018 similar to the 2017 low-cost scheme, based on &euro;25m funding from my Department to the Scheme. These measures are aimed at enhancing competitiveness within the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I have also introduced supports for Bord Bia for investment in market insight and market prioritisation initiatives, which are aimed at identifying and developing potential diversification opportunities. I have already increased funding to Bord Bia by &euro;10 million since the Brexit vote, and a further &euro;4.5 million is allocated in Budget 2018.  As part of this effort I will lead a number of trade missions to promote Irish food and drink in key markets. <\/p>  <p>  To enhance product diversification, I have also allocated funding to support the development of the new National Food Innovation Hub, which will be located in the Teagasc Moorepark complex. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains very focused on supporting farmers and the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead, whether they are based in Cavan, Monaghan or any other part of the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000110#WRUU01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Reform","counter":2096,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000110#WRUU01300"},{"type":"question","counter":2097,"qnumday":745,"qnumall":"[12748\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000110#WRUU01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if EU CAP regulations mandate that all basic payment and ANC scheme applications in 2018 must be submitted online; and if he has requested at EU level a temporary derogation in view of the fact many rural areas have no access to broadband.

This contrasts with a number of\u00a0other EU member states which have had severe difficulties in negotiating a successful renewal of their derogations and who have faced significant delays or have secured a reduced term in their derogation approval. The achievement of securing the renewal of the derogation is a significant milestone in the context of an expanding dairy herd and increasing milk production. While there are some additional stipulations attached to the derogation these are the outcome of a year long negotiations with the Commission and two separate public consultations.\u00a0 It was important when seeking the renewal that Ireland demonstrated commitment to tackling agricultural impacts on water.<\/p>  <p>  The measures in Ireland&rsquo;s derogation take account of the growing numbers of derogation farmers who are farming at intensive stocking rates (increasing from over 4,000 to 7,000 in recent years), and also environmental objectives for water, climate change and ammonia which Ireland must achieve. Furthermore, opportunities for large savings on farms through better grassland management and improved timing and application of fertiliser have been taken into account. <\/p>  <p>  Under the National Emissions Ceiling Directive, Ireland must also\u00a0reduce its ammonia emissions\u00a0with agriculture responsible for 98% of ammonia emissions. Ammonia losses from slurry are significantly reduced by slurry application in the Springtime and also by using low emission slurry spreading (LESS) equipment. Consequently the timeframes for slurry application stipulated in this measure will be effective in\u00a0reducing ammonia losses. The new measure will assist farmers to deliver their production targets, reduce their greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions and reduce the risk of runoff to water quality. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge that weather conditions have been challenging and this has created difficulties for some farmers in spreading slurry. Increasingly however farmers are maximising the value of slurry through Spring application.<\/p>  <p>  In order to\u00a0help farmers with the purchase of LESS equipment, support is\u00a0provided under\u00a0the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme known as TAMS II is, subject to the terms and conditions of the Scheme, at a general grant rate of 40% rising to 60% for qualifying Young Farmers. The maximum amount of investment eligible for grant aid under the LESS measure is generally &euro;40,000 per holding. It is also worth noting that the investment ceiling under this measure is, uniquely among all TAMS II measures, not subject to the overall TAMS II investment ceiling of &euro;80,000 per holding. \u00a0The TAMS II LESS Scheme has been very popular with over 980 approvals now issued for LESS equipment. Under the LESS Scheme and the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme of TAMS II the processing of applications for the supply of this equipment will continue until 31 December 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000110#WRUU01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy Negotiations","counter":2102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000110#WRUU01900"},{"type":"question","counter":2103,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[12750\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000110#WRUU02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on comments by Commissioner Oettinger (details supplied) that cuts of at least 5% to 10% are on the way in the next CAP; the number of meetings he has planned with his counterparts in Sweden, Denmark, France and the Netherlands on the CAP budget outside of Council of EU Ministers meetings; the steps he is taking to avoid reductions in the CAP budget after 2020; if he has proposed increasing the current overall CAP budget; and if he has formally requested that member states increase their national contribution to the EU budget to fill a deficit caused by Brexit.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2104,"content":"<p>The Budget Commissioner, Gunther Oettinger visited Dublin on 6\u00a0March 2018 as part of\u00a0a tour of European capitals, \u00a0in advance of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) proposals, which will be published on 2 May 2018.\u00a0Ministers for Finance take the lead in negotiations on the MFF.  <\/p>  <p>  During his appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure,\u00a0the Commissioner \u00a0referred to cuts to CAP and Cohesion of 5 - 10%.

I believe that coupled supports have a role to play in supporting vulnerable sectors, however, I do not consider it\u00a0optimal to divert significant sums of Pillar 1 monies into coupled support schemes.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that efforts should instead focus on ensuring the market delivers a satisfactory return for the end product produced by the farmer. At the recent Council of Minister's meeting\u00a0I indicated that \u00a0I could support a system that permitted member states to introduce\u00a0limited coupled supports on a voluntary basis, to\u00a0address a decline in a particular sector and\/or to help solve or mitigate environmental problems such as under grazing or potential land abandonment. <\/p>  <p>  As regards support for vulnerable sectors in disadvantaged land regions, the Programme for Government included a commitment to provide an additional &euro;25 million for the Areas of National Constraint (ANC)\u00a0Scheme in 2018.\u00a0 I am pleased to confirm that this commitment was delivered in Budget 2018 and that, subject to the EU Commission&rsquo;s approval of an amendment to Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme, this new funding will be available for payment under the 2018 ANC Scheme. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I am extremely conscious of the need for money to be targeted at those farmers on lands with higher levels of constraint.

It is planned to have dedicated GIS resources in place to support this. <\/p><p>- Under Action 40\u00a0of\u00a0the 2016 Report, a review was conducted to identify recommendations to address blackspots.

Once granted, each waste licence defines the nature of environmentally acceptable activities that can take place at a waste facility, including the acceptable types of waste that can be received. This is done by the conditions of the licence, which are set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). I have no function in relation either to the setting of operating conditions, including financial provision requirements attached, or their enforcement; and under section 60(3) of the\u00a0Waste Management Act 1996, as Minister, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by the EPA, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it.<\/p><p>It is a key aspect of the legislation, passed by the Oireachtas, to establish the EPA, that the Agency is entirely independent of the Minister in the exercise of its functions.\u00a0 With respect to other authorisations issued by the EPA, such as industrial emissions directive and integrated pollution control licences, I am constrained by the provisions of Sections 79(3) and 86(5) of the Environmental Protection Agency Acts from becoming involved in any way\u00a0with the licensing of installations under the EPA Acts or in the control of installations so licensed. <\/p><p>The prevention and remediation of environmental damage at contaminated sites, and from the closure of authorised activities, is a strategic priority for the EPA.\u00a0 To this end, operators under various authorisation regimes (such as waste, industrial emissions directive and integrated pollution control licensing) are required to make adequate financial provision for the potential environmental liabilities associated with closure and restoration\/aftercare and response to, and completion of remedial measures in the event of, an incident. A range of financial instruments including secured funds, bonds, parental company guarantees and insurance policies can be used for this purpose. <\/p><p>Irrespective of the type of financial instrument used, all financial provisions must be:<\/p><p>- Secure for the duration of the licensee's obligations (including in the event of insolvency) under a licence so that funds are available to discharge the licensee's obligations;<\/p><p>- Sufficient to meet all of the licensee's obligations and adequate to cover the cost of closure and environmental liability risks;<\/p><p>- Available to the EPA when required to discharge the licensee's obligations at the relevant time.<\/p><p>In cases where it is proposed to transfer a licence, the proposed transferee is required to demonstrate that he\/she is in a position to meet any financial commitments or liabilities incurred in carrying out the activity or in consequence of ceasing to carry on the activity. A proposed financial provision, in accordance with guidance issued by EPA, to address the financial liabilities as specified must be submitted and approved by the EPA prior to the completion of transfer of the licence.<\/p><p>In relation to petroleum authorisations granted, details of such\u00a0are published on my Department's website www.dccae.gov.ie on a quarterly basis. In addition, I lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as required\u00a0under Section 57 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, half yearly reports detailing all petroleum authorisations extant and granted during the period of the report. The last such report under this Act was in respect of the six-month period ending 31 December 2017. A Petroleum Lease is the form of petroleum authorisation under which oil and gas production is permitted. There are three extant Petroleum Leases i.e. the Kinsale\/Ballycotton, Seven Heads and Corrib gas fields.

Following a public consultation process, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities\u00a0published its independent regulatory decision in relation to the ownership of this infrastructure in October 2017. A key outcome of the decision is that the charging network should not form part of the regulated asset base and therefore expansions of the network should not be funded from network charges. This is in keeping with the proposals set out by the European Commission in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package which was published in 2016. <\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The Commission for Regulation of Utilities\u00a0also envisages the future sale of the infrastructure by ESB Networks. However, the continued ownership of the charging network by ESB Networks for a transitional period of up to ten years is provided for. This ensures no short to medium term impact on the electric vehicle charging infrastructure and allows the ESB to continue to provide electric vehicle charging across Ireland.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#0D0D0D\">The decision also set out the need for the\u00a0electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis.<\/font>In the absence of\u00a0State-led support, this is unlikely to happen in the near term.\u00a0 Funding has been allocated in my Department's budget this year\u00a0to support the provision of public charging, with a particular focus on increasing the number of rapid chargers on key national routes. <\/p><p>The Low Emissions Vehicle Taskforce, which is co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is considering a range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicles.

At its heart is a commitment to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and reduce the country&rsquo;s fossil fuel dependency.  This ambitious vision for Ireland&rsquo;s energy system envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from that sector by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050.  In 2016, imported fossil fuels accounted for 69% of our energy needs at a cost of\u00a0&euro;3.4 billion.\u00a0 The White Paper identified the long-term strategic importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050.\u00a0This vision was further developed in the National Mitigation Plan (NMP) which I published in 2017.<\/p><p>Achievement of the commitments set out in the Energy White Paper and the NMP\u00a0will require a significant transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system from being predominantly fossil-fuel based to a clean, low carbon energy system, including actions such as ending grant support for fossil fuels under the Better Energy Homes (BEH) scheme.<\/p><p>The BEH scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).\u00a0 The scheme\u00a0provides grant aid to homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.

When this process is finalised, the NBP team will be able to develop a strategy to\u00a0address BLUE area connection issues in the manner outlined above.

They have advised that passenger numbers on the Luas Green Line have increased by over 28% since the commencement of Luas Cross City last December.  While it is welcomed that so many new customers are using the extended Green Line, it has meant that, at certain times of the day,\u00a0some trams are operating at capacity. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Luas Cross City project included the purchase of seven additional new trams which, at\u00a055 metre length,\u00a0have a higher passenger capacity than existing trams, carrying up to 379 passengers per tram and\u00a0increasing overall capacity on the Green Line.  In advance of putting these seven new 55m trams into service, seven trams have now been transferred from the Red Line to the Green Line to provide additional capacity with the introduction of Luas Cross City.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised the NTA and TII that two of the 55m trams entered service in February, however, an unforeseen technical fault has arisen with the longer trams.  A specialist team from France have been flown in to urgently resolve this electrical problem.\u00a0 Building works at the Sandyford depot reduced maintenance capacity resulting in fewer trams being available for peak time service.  These works have been expedited, will be completed shortly and will speed up turn-around time for maintenance thereby increasing the number of trams available for peak services.  Extra maintenance crews have also been transferred from the Red to the Green line and the new Broombridge depot is now in use to assist with maintenance activities. <\/p>  <p>  All of the longer 55 trams - following the necessary\u00a0final testing and commissioning -\u00a0will be put into service progressively between now and end of May.\u00a0 Once all seven new trams are fully deployed they, together with the existing fleet, will provide\u00a0additional passenger capacity on the Green Line in the short-term.  Furthermore, the NTA has also advised of planned changes to the Luas Green Line timetable in May to improve the frequency of service between Broombridge and Brides Glen, particularly in the morning and evening peak periods on the Green and Red Lines.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Into the future, passenger numbers are\u00a0expected to\u00a0increase further on the Green Line over the next few years, and the Green Line Capacity Enhancement project - which was recently approved by Government - is the next step in the medium term to further expand capacity, especially at\u00a0peak hours,\u00a0so as\u00a0to cater for future demands along the Line.\u00a0 The project features in the\u00a0NTA&rsquo;s published GDA Strategy.\u00a0 It involves\u00a0the lengthening of the 26 existing Green line trams from 43 metres to 55 metres and the purchase of a further 8 new 55 metre-long trams which will greatly increase the passenger capacity of the fleet to meet future passenger demand. The capacity increases at peak periods which will be provided by the project will assist in reducing crowding on the Green Line and enhance accessibility for mobility and sensory impaired users during these periods.\u00a0 A necessary complementary investment project, known as\u00a0the Green Line Infrastructure Upgrade -\u00a0an investment project to lengthen the platforms at the existing Green Line stations -\u00a0was\u00a0completed towards the end of last year and enables the use of the new, longer trams.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000118#WRCCC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus &Eacute;ireann Services","counter":2480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000118#WRCCC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":2481,"qnumday":882,"qnumall":"[12948\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000118#WRCCC01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if Bus &Eacute;ireann recently made changes to its timetable (details supplied) for the express services from Donegal Town to Dublin from 9am to 8:30am; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":2482,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the Company for direct reply.

My wish is that this Plan will be reflective of the inputs from stakeholders and will be directly responsive to\u00a0areas for development\u00a0needed to support the most effective\u00a0delivery of the SCP.  <\/p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the positive outcomes from the\u00a0School Completion Programme and I can assure the Deputy that my Department along with Tusla Educational Welfare Service are fully committed to the future of the School Completion Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000119#WRDDD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan Data","counter":2547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000119#WRDDD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2548,"qnumday":904,"qnumall":"[12984\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000119#WRDDD03300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the projects mentioned in the National Development Plan 2018 to 2027 that come under her Department's remit or bodies under its aegis; and the estimated completion dates for each project in tabular form.","asker":"1221","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2549,"content":"<p>The most significant element of the National Development Plan (NDP) for my Department relates to the need for future expansion of childcare places due to multiple factors, such as demographics, labour force trends and\u00a0 current supply levels.<\/p>  <p>  There is a recognised need for large-scale, multi-annual capital investment in childcare over the period of the NDP and an additional &euro;250million is targeted for this purpose.

The Government has announced its intention to proceed with that policy in its recently published Roadmap for Pensions Reform.  To that end, and to inform the final design of the system, a public consultation will be conducted later this year, and the necessary legislative, technical and administrative arrangements will be determined and developed thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also announced in January that those affected by the 2012 rateband changes will also have the option of availing of a TCA-based pension, if it is to their advantage.  The TCA model being made available to them will award a maximum rate pension for those with 40 years contributions (including up to 20 years HomeCaring credits), and pro-rata payments for those with fewer contributions.  Up to 10 years ordinary credits (e.g. for Jobseekers or Illness Benefit) may also be used, subject to the total number of HomeCaring and ordinary credits not exceeding 20 years.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person has been in self-employment from the introduction of compulsory Class S contributions from 1988 until reaching State pension age, they may already receive a maximum rate State pension contributory, subject to meeting the general conditions for payment.  If not, they may still benefit from the new TCA arrangements, depending on their circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  The main focus of this reform has been to reward those who either made contributions into the Social Insurance Fund, or to recognise the contribution of those who took time out of the workforce for caring duties.  If someone made very little of either such contributions, and if their means are such that they would not qualify for a 95% state pension non-contributory (e.g. if they have substantial private or occupational pensions), they may benefit more from existing arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The new system for calculation of a person&rsquo;s rate of pension does not impact upon whether a person was liable for PRSI during a particular period.  If they have paid the required contributions at a reckonable rate &ndash; including Class S &ndash; they will be used in the calculation of their entitlements.

I want to emphasise to the Deputy that there are no recent court decisions which have implications for the application of penalty rates by my Department and there is no basis for the contention, whatsoever, that my department is acting illegally in sanctioning people for refusing to sign a contract. <\/p>  <p>  I also want to emphasise that Jobseekers are not required to sign a contract with JobPath service providers.  Jobseekers are asked to complete and sign a Personal Progression Plan (PPP).  A PPP is a crucial element of each jobseeker&rsquo;s engagement with any of the Department&rsquo;s activation services; generally the PPP will be an evolving document throughout the person&rsquo;s engagement period as they develop employment related skills and competencies or job related experience from short periods of employment. <\/p>  <p>  The primary goal of the Department&rsquo;s activation services is to move people from unemployment to full-time and sustained employment. All jobseekers are required to engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation service and this obligation applies irrespective of whether the service is provided by the Department&rsquo;s own case officers or those advisors employed by external contractors such as the JobPath providers.

However, generally speaking, trustees of pension schemes have duties and responsibilities under the Pensions Act, under trust law, and under other relevant legislation. <\/p>  <p>  They must administer the trust in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules.  The provisions of the Pensions Act are enforced by the Pensions Authority so any issues or complaints in relation to a particular scheme should be notified to the Authority for action.  The Pensions Authority will assess if there has been a breach of any legal obligations and take any necessary action if such a breach is found.<\/p>  <p>  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform, which was published recently by the Government, details specific measures that will modernise our pension system.  It sets out under Strand 4, &lsquo;Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes&rsquo;, that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 to respond to the ongoing difficulties in DB schemes and to increase protections for members as well encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are well funded and managed. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the General Scheme of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2017 (now the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017), was published in May 2017 and contained a number of key measures relating to DB pension schemes.  These proposed provisions will ensure that an employer cannot &ldquo;walk away&rdquo; at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting.  They seek a middle road between the current position where employers can abandon DB schemes and full and immediate debt on employer provisions.  The measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members&rsquo; benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes. <\/p>  <p>  These provisions are quite technical and complex.  Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage and I hope to be in position to bring forward the amendments at Committee Stage in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000121#WRFFF02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment","counter":2644,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000121#WRFFF02800"},{"type":"question","counter":2645,"qnumday":937,"qnumall":"[11927\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000121#WRFFF02900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the location from which a HAP applicant can redeem the full cost of rent which they have had to borrow in order to pay the rent while the HAP application is being processed (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2646,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is administered by Local Authorities and overall policy responsibility for HAP rests with my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.

From October 2013 onwards, the payment of half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for fuel allowance. If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance, then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and fuel allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.

Each Branch Office is operated and managed, under a contract for services, by a Branch Manager who is required to act as an agent for the Department in the area served by the office. Branch Office managers operate on a contract for service and are independent contractors.<\/p>  <p>  Services are provided through the Branch Offices network in areas which are not directly served by a Department operated Intreo centre.  The Department wishes to ensure that the services provided by the Department&rsquo;s Intreo Centres and Branch Offices are aligned so that all customers nationwide are provided with broadly similar services.<\/p>  <p>   On foot of this, officials from my Department have been engaged in ongoing discussions with the Branch Managers Association (BMA), a representative group of Branch Managers, regarding the Department&rsquo;s proposals for a new service delivery model. The main elements of the service delivery model relate to quality of accommodation, information provision, full use of all Department IT systems and support to activation and control activities. In tandem with the new service delivery model an improved remuneration model was proposed which would entail a positive shift from the traditional payment method, where payment was based on claim load, to a model based on delivery of an agreed service level. This is particularly significant in an environment where the Live Register is expected to continue to decline. It was also considered desirable that new contract arrangements would be put in place to copper fasten matters.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently, talks with the BMA included facilitated discussions under the chairmanship of Mr Kevin Duffy, a former Chair of the Labour Court. The facilitation process chaired by Mr Duffy provides a forum where the concerns of the Branch Managers and the Department can be discussed. In December 2017, Mr Duffy made a series of recommendations in relation to remuneration. The financial provisions recommended by Mr Duffy were inextricably linked to the operation of the new service model and were to commence as soon as practicable following the acceptance of his recommendations. The amounts available under the new remuneration model represent an annualised increase of approximately 28% when compared to the payments under the existing model in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  In his recommendation, Mr Duffy also stated that issues remained to be finalised in relation to the framework within which service contracts will be concluded with individual service providers and that on acceptance of these recommendations the parties should enter into a technical exercise to address the contractual terms and conditions in the contract on which the service will be provided. It was also recommended that that process commence as soon as practicable and conclude within an agreed timeframe. <\/p>  <p>  Both the Department and the BMA accepted Mr Duffy&rsquo;s   recommendations and arrangements were made to meet in January 2018 to engage in the technical exercise outlined by him and to bring matters to a conclusion. In effect, substantive agreement had been reached in relation to both remuneration and service delivery issues.<\/p>  <p>  During the course of the discussions in January 2018, the legal advice to my Department indicated that potential issues around competition law and procurement law needed to be considered and talks were adjourned to February 2018. <\/p>  <p>  When my officials subsequently met the BMA in February 2018, they advised the BMA that the manner in which the Department and BMA have engaged in negotiations potentially infringes the Competition Act.  As a result, the Department could no longer formally negotiate with the BMA.  However, the Department acknowledged that the BMA has a representative role in respect of its members, including the right to present the views of its members to the Department.  While the Department cannot negotiate with the BMA, the Department may take account of the views presented. In addition, the BMA was advised that were the Department to change the terms of the contracts the new contracts must, given their value, be subject to an open competition.<\/p>  <p>  My officials also advised the BMA that it considered that the enhanced services envisaged for Branch Offices can be achieved under the current contract arrangements with Branch Managers and that there is therefore no requirement to conclude new contracts with existing branch managers. <\/p>  <p>  The technical discussions recommended by Mr Duffy in December 2017 were not intended to reopen substantive discussions in relation to the financial remuneration package proposed for Branch Managers. However, on 19 February the BMA indicated, through Mr Duffy,  that it required commitments from the Department in relation to (1) an indemnity in respect of any redundancy costs in respect of Branch office employees; (2) compensation for Branch Managers in the event of contract termination. In the absence of these commitments, the BMA would no longer participate in discussions. Talks subsequently adjourned on that basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has a Framework Agreement for engagement with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) concerning social welfare services involving General Practitioners.  This framework provides for a process of engagement between the IMO and the Department. It also commits the IMO not to recommend, organise or facilitate any form of collective action by its members; that the IMO will avoid the promotion or facilitation of collective withdrawal of services; and that the IMO must inform its members that they should decide individually and not collectively whether to participate in service provision. These arrangements are in line with an agreement put in place by the Department of Health with the IMO with the approval of the Competition Authority. In contrast, the BMA has repeatedly threatened to undertake collective action which, by its own admission, would impact on the Department&rsquo;s customers.<\/p>  <p>  As previously stated, the manner in which the Department and BMA have engaged in negotiations heretofore potentially infringes the Competition Act.  As a result, the Department can no longer formally negotiate with the BMA.  However, I recognise the representative role of the BMA in respect of its members, including the right to present the views of its members to the Department.  My officials are available to meet the BMA on this basis and will take careful note of any views expressed by the BMA.  My officials remain available to discuss matters with the BMA. I have also invited its members to contact Mr Duffy and ask him to re-convene the facilitation process to discuss the proposed service delivery model. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000122#WRGGG01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Applications","counter":2681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000122#WRGGG01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2682,"qnumday":948,"qnumall":"[12201\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000122#WRGGG01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the difficulties persons are having making contact with the illness benefit section of her Department; her plans to improve the service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2683,"content":"<p>My Department&rsquo;s Illness Benefit Section receives approximately five thousand claims per week and has over 50,000 claims in payment at any time.

To date, the DMA service has helped approximately 5,000 such borrowers.  <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.

Unemployment decreased by 23,400 (-14.0%) in the year to Q4 2017 bringing the total number of persons unemployed to 144,100, marking the twenty second quarter in succession where unemployment has declined on an annual basis. Within the Border region, which includes Cavan and Monaghan, unemployment has fallen from a peak of 17.6% in Quarter 3, 2012 to 4.9% in Quarter 4, 2017. The number of people at work in the Border region increased by 59,800, to 238,500, over the same period.<\/p><p>While data from the Labour Force Survey is not available at the county level, trends in the Live Register can give an indication of underlying trends in local unemployment. <\/p><p>Overall, the Live Register in the counties of Cavan and Monaghan region has fallen by 48% in the 5 years to February 2018, slightly exceeding the reduction of 45% nationally.

During the first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  In addition to these two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.  The duration of the client engagement period must therefore be noted when considering statistics in relation to the service. <\/p>  <p>  Given the above, it is important to note that the below statistics are a snapshot at each particular point in time only.

It provides part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs and are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time. The scheme commenced operation in 2011 as a response to the high level of unemployment and the large numbers on the Live Register at that time.  There are 47 Local Development Companies (LDCs), as well as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, involved in the delivery of the T&uacute;s programme - known as Implementing bodies (IBs).   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the reduction in the unemployment rate is a factor in recruitment to all programmes.  Long-term unemployment is expected to fall further this year in line with the continuing forecasted fall in overall unemployment. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that given the welcome improvements in the labour market in recent years with reducing numbers of long-term unemployed on the Live Register, which is the target cohort for T&uacute;s, it is proving difficult to fill the number of places available nationwide.  However, changes were introduced recently to the selection criteria for T&uacute;s which should broaden the availability of T&uacute;s to a greater number of people on the live register.  This includes an increase in the percentage of assisted referrals from 20% to 30%, as well as permitting someone who has had a break of up to 30 days on the Live Register in the past 12 months to be considered eligible for T&uacute;s selection. <\/p>  <p>  In the five years since the end of December 2012, there has been a 48% fall in the numbers on the Live Register who are more than 1 year unemployed.

Between the peak in 2006 and the trough in 2013, housing construction fell by over 90%. In particular, all forms of medium- to large-scale residential development in our cities and urban areas stalled.\u00a0 With our economy returning to significant and consistent growth and with increasing population and employment, a significant increase in new homes is needed, and demand is outstripping supply, leading to a shortage of new homes\u00a0and house price and rent inflation.<\/p><p>Having regard to this, the Government has made the delivery of new homes, social, affordable and private, a top priority through the development, resourcing and implementation of the\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, published in July 2016.  The Plan built on previous strategies and was informed, in particular, by the Report of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness and extensive engagement with key stakeholders.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s initial focus has been on delivering homes for households in the lowest income brackets, through the commitment of over &euro;6 billion\u00a0to deliver 50,000 new social housing homes by 2021, with qualifying households also able to avail of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and other targeted programmes.  Building on the progress made under the 2011 Housing Policy Statement and the Social Housing Strategy 2020, including the roll out of HAP and the delivery of built, acquired and leased social housing homes, Rebuilding Ireland commits to meeting the housing needs of over 137,000 households by the end of 2021.<\/p><p>The implementation of Rebuilding Ireland is well underway and significant progress is being made.  This was evident in the Social Housing Output indicative figures published in January 2018, showing that nearly 26,000 households had their social housing need met in 2017, exceeding the target set.\u00a0 Of the combined target of 137,000, just under 45,000 households (or some 33% of the target for the 6 years) have had their social housing need met by the end of year 2 of the Plan.\u00a0 Further details can be accessed through the Social Housing Delivery 2017 Report (January 2018), which is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at link: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>Rebuilding Ireland has also prioritised supporting the supply of new and more affordable homes more generally, through, inter alia,\u00a0fast-track\u00a0planning reforms and more flexible planning guidelines; &euro;200 million investment in enabling infrastructure; the\u00a0development of large-scale mixed-tenure projects on State lands; and the\u00a0help-to-buy scheme to assist first-time buyers.<\/p><p>To help renters in the parts of the country where rents are highest and rising, the Government\u00a0 introduced\u00a0Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), where rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% annually for three years.  Currently, the measure covers almost 57% of existing rental properties across the country, including 100% of rental properties in the\u00a0two largest cities, Dublin and Cork.<\/p><p>In Budget 2018, the Government removed significant obstacles to building more homes more quickly, by investing\u00a0more in direct\u00a0house-building by the State; removing\u00a0the Capital Gains\u00a0Tax incentive to hold on to\u00a0residential land; escalating\u00a0penalties for\u00a0land hoarding; introducing a\u00a0new\u00a0&euro;25 million Serviced Sites fund and a second LIHAF infrastructural\u00a0investment fund; and providing\u00a0a new, more\u00a0affordable finance vehicle for builders\u00a0through Home\u00a0Building Finance\u00a0Ireland (HBFI).<\/p><p>As part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, a further package of affordability measures was announced on 22 January 2018, with a new\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan,\u00a0a new\u00a0Affordable Purchase Scheme, and a focus on cost\u00a0rental projects.<\/p><p>Most recently, on 9 March, I published\u00a0new planning guidelines to facilitate delivery of a broader mix of apartment types to meet contemporary housing demand, particularly in urban areas, for example in the emerging &lsquo;build to rent&rsquo; and &lsquo;shared accommodation&rsquo; sectors.<\/p><p>Residential construction capacity was very badly affected by the downturn and it is taking time to recover.  However, there are very positive signs that Rebuilding Ireland and the collaborative efforts of my Department, local authorities, approved housing bodies and many other delivery partners and stakeholders\u00a0are working.

These are based on meteorological &lsquo;threshold&rsquo; parameters with impact considerations taken into account and the system is aligned with the European MeteoAlarm system.  The concept behind the coloured levels of weather alerts and warnings is simple:<\/p><p>- Status Yellow, weather alert &ndash; Be Aware;<\/p><p>- Status Orange, weather warning &ndash; Be Prepared;<\/p><p>- Status Red, severe weather warning &ndash; Take Action.  <\/p><p>The issue of Status Red severe weather warnings is a comparatively rare event and indicates that recipients should take action to protect themselves and\/or their properties, but the Met &Eacute;ireann weather warnings do not specify what that action should be.  <\/p><p>The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department works closely with Met &Eacute;ireann and monitors the alerts and warnings in place and recommends a range of actions which it judges appropriate for the circumstances.  If necessary, the National Directorate will convene a National Emergency Coordination Group on behalf of my Department in its role as the Lead Government Department for the response to severe weather events.  Having considered the weather forecasts, the timing of likely impacts and other relevant factors, the National Emergency Coordination Group may issue specific public safety advice where it deems this appropriate, or more general safety messages as appropriate for the anticipated conditions.  Severe weather warnings issued by Met &Eacute;ireann and the public safety advice issued by the National Emergency Coordination Group should not be conflated.  <\/p><p>It is for individuals and organisations to decide what action to take in response to Met &Eacute;ireann severe weather warnings or specific National Emergency Coordination Group public safety advice such as advice to remain indoors.  I am satisfied that, on the two occasions when a National Emergency Coordination Group issued such public safety advice, it was disseminated effectively and that, in general,\u00a0individuals and organisations responded appropriately, notwithstanding the challenges that this posed in a number of cases.  <\/p><p>It is appropriate for organisations to review their experience of recent events and to include learning points in their business continuity planning which will enable them to judge appropriate actions better for future weather events.

Determination as to whether it is appropriate for businesses and organisations to remain open, and\/or for essential personnel to attend, following the issuing of a Status Red severe weather warning by Met &Eacute;ireann, requires local judgement based on forecast conditions and the circumstances.  The public safety advice issued by National Emergency Coordination Group is more relevant in such decisions.  <\/p><p>I am satisfied that Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s current weather warning system, which is aligned fully with European best practice and with the MeteoAlarm system, provides sufficient clarity on the predicted type, timing, extent and track of weather hazards and of severe weather.  The need for clarity with regard to the distinction between Met &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s meteorological 'threshold' based weather warnings and public safety advice being issued by the National Emergency Coordination Group during the pre-event and response phase of a severe weather event will be highlighted by my Department in its review report on recent severe weather events.  I propose incorporating the review of the recent snow event with the review report on ex-Hurricane Ophelia and three other episodes of flooding - Donegal, Mountmellick and Galway City - before bringing a composite report to Government in due course.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000127#WRMMM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2963,"content":"<p>Question No. 1046 answered with Question No. 1044.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties Data","counter":2964,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000127#WRMMM03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2965,"qnumday":1047,"qnumall":"[12458\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000127#WRMMM03700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the average cost to each local authority to refurbish a vacant property in order for it to return to housing stock, by local authority, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":2966,"qnumday":1048,"qnumall":"[12459\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000127#WRMMM03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the average target time for refurbishment of vacant properties in each local authority area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":2967,"qnumday":1049,"qnumall":"[12460\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000127#WRMMM03900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount each local authority spent on the refurbishment of vacant properties in their areas in 2016 and 2017, and to date in 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":2968,"qnumday":1050,"qnumall":"[12461\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000127#WRMMM04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of vacant properties that have been refurbished and have returned to the housing stock in each Dublin local authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2969,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1047 to 1050, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Between 2014 and 2017, my Department provided funding to local authorities to return some 9,227 vacant units to productive use.  Details on the number of voids, derelicts and 2 into 1s brought back into use are set out in the table.  The purpose of the voids programme is to ensure that vacant units are actively targeted and returned to productive use, as quickly as possible.  My Department does not keep statistics on the average time for refurbishment of vacant properties.  <\/p><p>Under the voids programme, local authorities can claim up to &euro;30,000 funding per unit.  However, should they wish to do so, local authorities may also contribute funding from their own resources to complete these works.  The derelicts and 2 into 1 programmes require greater levels of remediation with associated higher costs, in excess of the limits as set out in the voids programme.  My Department does not keep data on the average cost to each local authority to refurbish a vacant property.  Based on the funding provided by my Department and the units delivered between 2014 and 2017 outlined below, the overall average cost to refurbish a vacant property is approximately &euro;13,000.

In this context, the reference to available resources includes having recourse to borrowing and it is a matter for individual authorities to decide the purpose for which it wishes to borrow and the preferred lender. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for monitoring the local government sector&rsquo;s overall compliance with fiscal rules set out as part of the management of the Stability and Growth Pact.  These include the contribution of the local government sector to the General Government Balance and controls exercised under the Expenditure Benchmark requirements. <\/p>  <p>  Arising from the Government&rsquo;s effort to meet commitments in relation to the general government deficit limit, local authorities have been directed that, similar to their revenue account activity, capital expenditure should not exceed capital income within the reporting year.  The precise manner in which capital and current accounts are managed in order to achieve the overall balance necessary is a matter for individual local authorities themselves. <\/p>  <p>  However, within these overall limits, there is capacity for the expenditure of built up capital balances and own resources, or expenditure supported by borrowing, which must be sanctioned by the\u00a0Minister with policy responsibility for the specific programme involved. \u00a0In reviewing requests for sanction, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed, that contractual commitments and on-going projects can proceed; and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The term \"off-balance sheet\" is understood to mean activity which is outside of general government and therefore does not add to general government debt or impact on the general government balance.\u00a0 As local authorities are classified within the general government sector, local authority borrowing from third parties, such as the EIB, increases general government debt.\u00a0 Regardless of the source of the funds, once spent by local authorities (when the transaction is with a non-general government counter party), such expenditure is generally counted as general government expenditure and impacts on the general government balance.<\/p>  <p>  It is possible that investments in capital and infrastructural projects may be\u00a0undertaken in an off-balance sheet manner, e.g. public private partnerships, which are subject to specific features and conditions.  The classification of such investments is\u00a0a matter for\u00a0the Central Statistics Office.<\/p>  <p>  Against the background of the affordability pressures which exist in the rental market, particularly\u00a0in cities and other\u00a0major urban areas, the Government is\u00a0determined to make cost rental a major part of the Irish housing system.  To this end, a number of pilot cost rental projects are currently being progressed in Dublin and, in parallel, discussions are ongoing with the European Investment Bank to leverage its experience and knowledge in developing and supporting cost rental and other affordable models, with a view to developing further projects in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000128#WRNNN04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3017,"content":"<p>Question No. 1067 answered with Question No. 1060.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan Data","counter":3019,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000129#WROOO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3020,"qnumday":1068,"qnumall":"[12993\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000129#WROOO00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the projects mentioned in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 that come under his Department's remit or bodies under its aegis; and the estimated completion dates for each project in tabular form.

This investment programme will be closely aligned with the Creative Ireland Programme and will include a specific scheme to invest in regional arts and culture facilities among other initiatives.  <\/p><p>- An investment of &euro;285 million will be made in our natural and built heritage.

The Review compared Irish peatland excavations with best practice internationally.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the results of the analysis, the Review proposed priorities, strategies and methods for future archaeological survey and excavation in Bord Na M&oacute;na peatlands, including the development of an overarching research framework.  Since 2013, as part of that framework, my Department has prioritised the completion of first round survey work in those areas of the Bord Na M&oacute;na peatlands not previously surveyed, including the identification of new archaeological discoveries.  With a view to preserving suitable peatland monuments in situ, the Department also commissioned survey work in 2016 and 2017 to examine how varying prospection techniques, both geophysical and manual, can best be applied to Irish peatlands. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in consultation with the National Museum of Ireland, my Department commissioned survey work in 2013 in a location\u00a0where numerous bog bodies had been found in order to examine the potential for methodical field surveys to identify human remains. My Department is currently preparing a tender to review Class 1 toghers that traverse bogs and that form prehistoric and historic routeways across the country.  The results of this work will inform proposals for future excavation and preservation\u00a0in situ\u00a0of that suite of monuments.<\/p>  <p>  The Review recommends that all archives should be standardised and synthesised and that a comprehensive database should be developed for all archaeological work in Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands.  However, my Department&rsquo;s view is that the national dataset in relation to peatland archaeology is best placed within the existing dataset of all monuments.  This will facilitate the production of a comprehensive and fully integrated Sites and Monuments Record for the purposes of the National Monuments Acts.  Those monument types regularly identified in peatland environments have been classified in a manner that will allow them to be distinguished from other classes of monuments so as to enhance the research potential offered by my Department&rsquo;s Historic Environment Viewer which enables the viewer to examine individual and national mapped monument records online. <\/p>  <p>  The Review also identified issues in relation to reporting on excavations. In response to this, Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Peatlands Post-Ex Project 2000-2013 was established.  This relates to 153 individual licensed excavations of 171 monuments, which were investigated between 2000 and 2013. I understand that all preliminary reports have been submitted and that a contract for the final reporting phase of the project has now been awarded by Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is expected that all outstanding work will be completed by June 2019.<\/p>  <p>  All final reports licensed by my Department since 2013 in relation to Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands have included a range of specialist analyses, including palaeoenvironmental sampling to retrieve as much information as possible about the local and regional landscape, environment and climatic context of the sites.  This multi-proxy approach included specialist wood analysis, plant macrofossil work on peat cores and samples, and insect remains analysis.  The work was carried out by leading experts and has been integrated into rigorously dated contextual information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000130#WRPPP04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Development Plan Data","counter":3114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000130#WRPPP04550"},{"type":"question","counter":3115,"qnumday":1102,"qnumall":"[12986\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000130#WRPPP04600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the projects mentioned in the National Development Plan 2018-2027 that come under her Department's remit or bodies under its aegis; and the estimated completion dates for each project in tabular form..

This is in addition to an investment of &euro;178 million in the Irish language and in our Gaeltacht and Island communities.   <\/p>  <p>  A cornerstone of our culture investment programme is the &euro;460 million that is being set aside for the renovation of the National Cultural Institutions, the protection of the national collections and the enhancement of visitor experiences and services.  This funding programme will build on the success of the renovation of the Miltown and Dargan wings of the National Gallery and will include significant capital investments in our institutions, most of which are based in Dublin, but including also the Crawford Gallery in Cork.<\/p>  <p>  Under a new culture and creativity programme, an investment of &euro;265 million will be made in enhancing regional cultural infrastructure to ensure that people in all parts of Ireland enjoy opportunities to engage with the arts and culture, in the expansion of the audio-visual sector as a key element of the Government&rsquo;s creative industries investment, and in the digitisation of the National Collections to ensure they are preserved and made available to a global audience.  Funding will also be made available for Galway 2020 when it takes on the title of EU Capital of Culture.  <\/p>  <p>  The National Development Plan also emphasises the amenity value of our natural and built heritage with an investment programme of &euro;285 million over the period of the plan.  Under the Plan, my Department will develop a major new investment programme for our National Parks and Nature Reserves which are invaluable natural assets, as well as being hubs for outdoor activities and tourism.  We will also invest in our built heritage and our inland waterways, while the implementation of our National Biodiversity Plan will assist in the protection our landscapes, peatlands and biodiversity for future generations.  <\/p>  <p>  A further &euro;178 million is also being provided to support and protect the Irish language, Gaeltacht communities and communities on our offshore islands.  This is a particularly welcome announcement this year given that it has been designated as Bliain na Gaeilge.  This will support a wide range of actions from investments to support job creation, supports for Island communities and language and cultural hubs to support the Irish language.  It also looks to support opportunities to expand the Irish Language community beyond the Gaeltacht including the development of a flagship language and culture hub in Dublin City.  It will also include developments at piers in the Aran Islands and at Machaire Rabhartaigh, serving Tory Island. <\/p>  <p>  The NDP has provided an annual breakdown of our investment over the next five years which affords my Department the necessary clarity to allow us to properly schedule the delivery of our projects and programmes.  2018 will be a critical year for the appraisal of, and planning and design for many of our flagship projects with a view to moving to the implementation phase in the following years.  More details on the commencement and completion dates of these projects and programmes will emerge as we go through this process of rigorously appraising and planning for these important investments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032000130#WRPPP04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
