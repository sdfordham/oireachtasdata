I know everybody is very busy on one of the last days, but I am raising an issue that I raised before about a year ago.  Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna is a school in Knocklyon where the students and teachers have been in prefabs for 18 years.  This is unprecedented and unacceptable in Ireland.<\/p> <p>Every education Minister has said that prefabs are not suitable for the education of children and that they do not expect any school to be in a prefab for longer than three years.  This school has been in a prefab for 18 years.  I had this matter on the agenda here before.  Parents and teachers are looking for a permanent building.  When I was attending a meeting in Knocklyon last Thursday night, a mouse ran across the floor.  I understand this is a daily occurrence in a space where children are being educated.  The Minister of State knows what that does from the perspectives of health, safety and cleanliness.  It disrupts the class for a time.  It is a regular occurrence.  I have campaigned on this issue for almost 20 years, since I was first elected to South Dublin County Council.  I do not usually raise local issues in the Seanad, but the question of prefabs is a national educational issue.  I know it is now the policy of the Department of Education and Skills to have all schools out of prefabs within three years.  That is a new policy.  I have heard the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, speaking about that.<\/p> <p>This case has been going on for far too long.  An urgent solution needs to be found by South Dublin County Council and the Minister for Education and Skills.  It is disappointing, to say the least, that delays have been caused by bureaucracy and the legalities of the purchase of this site, which is in no-man's land because the bureaucracy has taken so long.  I have raised this matter with the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the current Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I raised it here with the Minister of State, Deputy English, approximately a year ago.  I was told ten years ago that the site would be vested in the Department of Finance.  Then I was told that there would be a compulsory purchase order.  Now it is back to a compulsory purchase order again.  It is totally unclear.  I want a clear answer.  If the Minister of State cannot verbally give me a clear answer here on the record of the Seanad, I want it in writing.  I want to be told in simple language - A, B and C - when this is going to happen.<\/p> <p>In May 2015, the Minister of State, Deputy English, said that the commencement of the building could not take place before the formal transfer of the land.  On 22 June last, my office received a further letter from the Minister for Education and Skills which stated that the board and the Department had agreed a proposal that would possibly serve as a satisfactory solution.  Today, we are back to square one.  The compulsory purchase order has still not been taken.  I have been told by South Dublin County Council that it will be initiated.  The context is a clear commitment from the Government.  The money is there.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Minister have said that money is not the issue.  The money will be forthcoming.  The legalities need to be ironed out with the legal people in South Dublin County Council.  Perhaps more pressure needs to be put on the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>I want to see this happen in the next month.  I want to see the compulsory purchase order out of the way and dealt with.  Perhaps the Minister of State's last act in the Department of Education and Skills will be to get this school on the road for the people of Knocklyon and Dublin South-West by 2021.  The Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Skills said that the use of prefabs for more than two years would be a rare exception.  This case is a rare exception in Ireland.  It has been 18 years on the go.  I ask the Minister of State to highlight the reasons for this and say how and when it is going to be solved.  I would appreciate it if he could give me a date and the other clear details I am seeking.  It has slipped through the net.  I do not like to use the word \"negligence\" when I am talking about officials in councils or elsewhere, but it is downright irresponsible, to put it mildly, that such delays are being caused by bureaucracy, carelessness and inefficiency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200004#D00200","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454424300,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I am sorry for keeping her waiting.  I could not make it here before 2.45 p.m.  I thought I was due to respond to the third Commencement matter.  I apologise for the problems that were caused.<\/p>  <p>As the Senator is aware, officials from my Department have been working closely with officials from South Dublin County Council to secure a suitable site to facilitate the delivery of permanent school accommodation for Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna.  Agreement in principle on the acquisition by the Department of a site owned by South Dublin County Council has been reached.  That is going back quite a while now.  The site in question is the current location of the school&rsquo;s temporary accommodation and has been deemed to be technically suitable for the development of permanent accommodation.  As has been outlined to the Senator previously, certain title issues associated with the site were identified as part of the standard conveyancing process.  As the Senator will understand, it is critical for these issues to be resolved before the Minister takes ownership of the site.  The resolution of title issues can sometimes be complex.  Unfortunately, this has proven to be the case in respect of the site for Gaelscoil Chnoc Liamhna.<\/p>  <p>South Dublin County Council has worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills and the Property Registration Authority for some time in an effort to achieve a satisfactory outcome.  The complexity of the issue has meant that the site acquisition has been delayed significantly while officials work towards a resolution.  Officials from my Department have discussed with their counterparts in South Dublin County Council possible mechanisms which could provide a satisfactory resolution to the title issues and thereby facilitate the land transfer.  Officials from my Department have been informed that South Dublin County Council intends to initiate a compulsory purchase order process as soon as possible, subject to legal advice which is under discussion with a law agent.<\/p> <p>My officials have also been informed that representatives of the council have arranged to meet the school's board of management next week to update it and discuss the matter.<\/p> <p>Once the acquisition of the site is finalised, it is the intention of my Department to initiate the architectural planning process for the provision of a new school building.  Officials from the Department will continue to work closely with officials from South Dublin County Council to progress matters in the context of the pressing need to advance the project for the provision of permanent accommodation.<\/p> <p>I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the Seanad.  The matter has been ongoing for a long time.  I would have assumed that it would have moved on at this stage, but it has not.  At this stage the only way to move the issue forward involves compulsory purchase orders.  The council has tried to do all it can to avoid having to do that, but it looks as though progress will involve that.  There is a commitment for that to happen.  I can make sure the Department keeps the Senator informed of the situation over the next couple of weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200005#E00200","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454424900,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I was told about eight years ago that the county council would go down the route of compulsory purchase orders.

It has gone as far as drawing up plans for the school, which is unprecedented and for which I thank it.<\/p>  <p>The Minister of State's Department will have to contact the legal department in South Dublin County Council and make sure the work is done.

Last week, on the Order of Business, I raised the case of Carol Brill who has Usher syndrome.  She has a devastating rare genetic disease that causes the gradual deterioration of hearing and sight for which there is no cure or treatment at present.  The Leader proposed and suggested that it would be more appropriate for me to raise the matter as a Commencement matter this week.<\/p>  <p>Last year, at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, Carol spoke and pleaded passionately for help for people who have the dual-sensory loss of sight and hearing.  She spoke about the urgency of recognising deaf-blindness as a unique disability.  In 2015, Carol was formally diagnosed with Usher syndrome type 2a.  The diagnosis was only possible through the relationships that Carol had forged with many of the international researchers working in the field.  She did all of this with drive and energy, despite being handicapped with deteriorating sight and hearing.  She has to wear very high powered hearing aids but she is not entitled to get them on a medical card.  She is 45 years of age and it is very difficult for her to get a job with her unique problem.  <\/p>  <p>I wish to point out that there is no dedicated entry on the national physical and sensory disability database to record her needs and that of people like her.  Such people should have their needs recorded on the database.<\/p> <p>There is not a single case worker to look after her needs and the needs of other people with her unique disability.  I am pleading with the Minister of State in the dying days of this Government and, please God, when she goes forward again herself in the next Government, that this issue be dealt with and that there be compassion for the people who have this rare syndrome.  The horror of going deaf and blind simultaneously just does not bear thinking about - everything going dark.  Deafness and blindness, generally speaking, are unique to people as they get older but this affects young people.  Carol herself is 45 years of age.  What is keeping her spirits going is her daughter of eight, Sarah.  She conquered depression when her marriage broke up and her baby son died.  She has come through so much and is an inspiring person.  I am here today pleading her case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200007#L00300","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454425500,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator both for her patience and for raising the issue.  I did listen to the evidence given.  One could not but be touched by what we heard.  I would like to thank Senator White for raising the issue on the Commencement of the Seanad today.<\/p>  <p>In addressing the specifics of the question raised in the Commencement matter, the Minister for Health does not classify or recognise specific medical illnesses or conditions as a disability.  There are a number of definitions of disability that are used for particular purposes, for example, the Disability Act, the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act, the Equal Status Act, the Employment Equality Acts and the census.  In addition, there are definitions of disability in use for determining qualifying criteria for income supports such as domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance.  These definitions describe disability in terms of an individual&rsquo;s functional ability in his or her environment, rather than a medical diagnosis or condition.  The Government currently provides funding of approximately &euro;1.57 billion to the disability services programme as described in the HSE&rsquo;s national plan for 2016.<\/p>  <p>Persons with disabilities, including those who are blind, those who are deaf, and those who are both deaf and blind can access the broad range of acute hospital, general practitioner, primary care and community-based services, as well as specialist disability services.  I would like to outline for the Seanad the specialist disability services provided for people who are deaf or hard of hearing and for those who are blind or vision-impaired.  Services for blind and vision-impaired people are provided as part of the HSE&rsquo;s physical and sensory disability services and are delivered directly and in partnership with a number of voluntary service providers, including the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, the National Association of Housing for the Visually Impaired, ChildVision and Fighting Blindness.  The HSE community audiology services provide assessment and rehabilitation for medical card holders and, separately, for children.  The audiology services provided include audiological assessment, hearing aid fitting and management advice, and advice on the use of assistive listening devices.  In addition, the service provides onward referral to acute hospital specialist services, the cochlear implant programme, speech and language therapy or other services as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>There are a number of voluntary organisations providing specialist disability services to people who are deaf or hard of hearing including DeafHear, the Catholic Institute for Deaf People, the Irish Hard of Hearing Association and the Irish Deaf Society.  DeafHear is the largest provider of such services and receives over &euro;4 million in funding from the HSE.  The services offered by these organisations include family support services, assistive technology and assistive listening devices, communication therapy and lip-reading classes, sign language classes, and a mental health and deafness service.  These organisations receive funding from the HSE.<\/p>  <p>Along with the broad range of acute hospital services, general practitioner and community care services and the specialist services outlined above, the HSE also supports the Anne Sullivan Foundation for Deafblind.  The foundation is funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 and provides residential services for people who are deaf-blind.  The foundation receives over &euro;1.9 million from the HSE for the provision of specialist services to people who are deaf-blind.<\/p> <p>The foundation received over &euro;1.9 million from the HSE for the provision of specialist services to people who are deaf-blind.  People who are deaf-blind receive a wide range of health and professional social care services from the HSE.  They attend general practitioners and specialists in acute hospitals to provide for their clinical needs.  In addition, specialist services and supports are provided by the HSE and a range of agencies and organisations.<\/p> <p>I know Senator White will understand this, because she has heard it before.  Not a month goes by when we are not approached and asked to define a different area differently or in a specific way.  Most of us would know off the top of our heads what these areas are.  It is our intention to provide a service with a broad range.  If Niall Keane from DeafHear were sitting in the Gallery today - I am sure he will be listening in another way - I imagine he would agree.  I have always believed that deafness is different.  It is isolating and it keeps people separate from the rest of the community.  However, we must ensure that the services provided have a broad range and that people need not fit into a particular category to access a given service.  That is important and it has always been my belief that this is the best approach when it comes to disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200008#M00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454425800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I am afraid the Minister of State and I misunderstand one another.

The key is the combination of one or more of the disabilities of hearing difficulty and sight loss.  It is a question of suffering from the conditions simultaneously.  It is not a question of hearing loss or blindness, it is a matter of when a person has both.  That is the key and that is what we are discussing today.<\/p>  <p>There is no register for deaf-blind people, yet there is a register for blind people and for deaf people.  That is the issue.

I have a very important matter to raise in the Commencement debate.  It goes to the heart of the failure of the Government's primary health care strategy.  The Government has been slowly opening a number of primary health care centres throughout the country.<\/p> <p>Full and integrated primary health care is essential, not just for curing and treating people, but for solving the hospital crisis.  Too many people are going to hospitals when they could easily be treated in primary health care centres.<\/p> <p>I was pleased that pressure was applied in the Seanad by me and in the D&aacute;il and locally by my colleagues to ensure that the centre in Kells was delivered.  It has been built and is about to open, but a number of issues have arisen, one of which is that of parking charges.  The centre is situated far outside the town and there is no issue with parking in the area except at the health care centre.  The only reason one might go to the building is to attend the centre.  One cannot nip out to the shops beside it because there are none.<\/p> <p>It has been suggested locally that there will be a charge of &euro;4 to enter or exit the car park.  For someone driving from Kells town to the centre, &euro;4 is a great deal of money.  Is there a policy on this matter at national level?  It makes doctors' practices unattractive, as parking can be found at considerably cheaper rates or for no cost at all in the town centre.  The charge goes against the strategy and should not happen.  I hope that the Minister of State will tell me that it will not happen.  It is not right.  There have been too many controversies about parking charges at hospitals and the inconvenience these pose.  Generally speaking, hospitals are one-off events for most people whereas attending a primary care centre is a regular event, in particular for many people with chronic diseases.  They attend centres to get appropriate treatments at an early stage in order to stay out of hospital.  Why are parking charges being tolerated and will the Minister of State stop their imposition?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200009#N01500","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454426400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>May I clarify something first?

In certain circumstances that are dependent on a centre's location, however, it may be necessary to control car parking and charge for its use.  I am assuming that this is when a centre is in the middle of a busy and built-up area.  In these circumstances, parking fees are similar to those charged by the local authority for parking in the area.<\/p>  <p>As the Senator will be aware, local authorities throughout the country operate systems of parking restrictions and fees so as to ensure that parking does not cause obstructions for other people using the roads and footpaths or accessing local businesses or services.  In primary care centres delivered by way of operational leases, a specified number of spaces are provided to the HSE under those leases.  Any additional parking provided by the developer is under his or her control and he or she may charge fees on these additional spaces.  The parking fees charged by the developer are generally in line with the public car parking fees in the area.<\/p> <p>The modernisation of our primary care structure and practice is vital to the successful delivery of services in the future.  The development of primary care teams and primary care centres is a priority under the programme for Government and an extremely important element in the health reform process.  The provision of primary care centres and teams throughout the country will significantly increase health and social care in local communities, which will be achieved by redirecting services away from acute hospitals.  Primary care infrastructure is being delivered under three mechanisms, namely, direct build, leasing initiative and public private partnerships, PPPs, announced in 2012.  As for the slow roll-out - I hope the Senator takes note of this - the development of primary care centres is central to this Government's objective to deliver a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective health system.  To date, 90 primary care centres have been completed and a further 16 are under construction.  That is in the middle of the worst economic collapse this country has ever seen.  In addition, it is expected that the PPP contract for the provision of 14 primary care centres will be signed this month, February 2016, and construction will commence next month.

I was pleased to report that there had been a significant increase in the figures for the north west.  I mentioned specifically that my own county, which had recorded <i>nul points<\/i>up to now, had received eight visits and that County Sligo had received 15 visits.<\/p><p>While visits are welcome - they are all very well - there must be a focus on what happens afterwards.  In that context, I contacted IDA Ireland to find out exactly what it does after these visits have gone ahead.  The reply I received was somewhat ambiguous.  I was told that IDA Ireland is targeting an increase of 30% to 40% in the number of investments for each region outside Dublin.  This has to be welcomed.  We have often exchanged views on this issue.<\/p><p>Everyone, including members of the Government parties, will say that even if the statistics support the Minister's statement that IDA Ireland investment is evenly spread, the evidence on the ground does not necessarily coincide with that view.  The reply I received from IDA Ireland made it clear that as part of its strategy, the agency continues to encourage visiting itineraries to visit County Leitrim and the rest of the north west.  IDA Ireland said that when it is marketing County Leitrim and the wider region, it advises visiting itineraries of the availability of relevant skill sets, third level institutes, industry clusters and relevant property solutions, etc.  It pointed out that regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders is also important in positioning any regional location to attract foreign direct investment.  It said it is continuing to engage in such activity, while also working with existing clients in all regional locations to generate additional jobs.<\/p><p>At least it opened the veil a little on the exact criteria that are used when these visits take place.  I think that is interesting and should be put on the record, but the main point of my query was to find out what happens afterwards.  Unfortunately, IDA Ireland was not quite as forthcoming in that regard.  Instead, it chose to hide behind commercial sensitivity in a way that reminded me what people say in all the movies we watch about America when a question arises about something.  They say &quot;We cannot answer that because of national security.&quot;<\/p><p>In this instance, IDA Ireland is saying that information on active leads is confidential between IDA Ireland and its client companies because it is commercially sensitive.  It is also saying that it is continuing to pursue, engage and implement active leads as they arise throughout the country.  It also says that the final decision on where to locate an investment resides and always will reside with the client company.<\/p><p>I appreciate that there is sensitivity involved here, but surely it would be helpful if IDA Ireland could give some indication of what is happening, other than merely giving details of these visits.  That is all we hear.  We are told about the visits.  I do not think we can do anything to change that.  Although I welcome the increase in visits to my own county and the north west generally, I want to record my hope that those visits will result in something more fruitful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200012#Q00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1454427300,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I welcome today's very good news that the unemployment rate has fallen again.  There has been a remarkable month-on-month fall from 10.1% this time last year to the current rate of 8.6%.  Some 5,125 new jobs were created in January alone.  It is really impressive that, on average, more than 1,000 jobs are being created each week.  I want to note this significant achievement.  I am sure all my colleagues will join me in welcoming it.<\/p>  <p>I commend the Irish Penal Reform Trust on its release or launch this morning of an important new report based on research conducted by academics in Queen's University.  The report, Out on the Inside, documents the experiences of LGBT people in Irish prisons.  This groundbreaking research is the first of its kind because we have no data on the sexuality of prisoners.  This research, which aims to shine a light on a marginalised group of people, conveys some very disturbing findings regarding the experiences of LGBT prisoners in Ireland.  I commend it to the House and commend the Irish Penal Reform Trust for producing it today.<\/p> <p> I would like to express grave concern about the revelations of abuse in a foster home in the south east which occurred over a prolonged period of time.

There may well be evidence that points towards an offence of reckless endangerment, something about which we need to be mindful in any debates on this issue.

A number of things are going on.

I always think of the great poem by Antaine &Oacute; Raifteir&iacute;:<\/p><blockquote>Anois, teacht an Earraigh, beidh an l&aacute; ag dul chun s&iacute;neadh<br \/><br \/>'S tar &eacute;is na F&eacute;ile Br&iacute;de ard&oacute;idh m&eacute; mo sheol.<\/blockquote><p>I feel a bit like raising my own sails, in particular with an election in the offing.  That was yesterday.  Today is James Joyce's 134th birthday, something I thought was worthy of mention in the Seanad.<\/p><p>I will turn to matters less pleasant.  I would like to raise the question of workers in the construction industry, 50% of whom are described as self-employed.  They are not.  Rather, they are forced into this situation by their employers who thereby avoid paying employer's PRSI and all the rest.  It seems to me to be very cruel and wrong.  This kind of bogus self-employment has cost the Exchequer about &euro;80 million a year, a considerable amount of money.  In effect, bogus self-employment means that workers and taxpayers end up subsidising unscrupulous employers.<\/p><p>Some protesters at the gate of Leinster House gave me an advertisement from a recruitment company, which I will not mention by name.  It categorises a number of things under the heading &quot;advantages of using a recruitment service&quot;, whereby the agency engages individual workers and forces them to be self-employed.  The advantages include the fact that there is no PRSI to pay, which is 10.7% of total pay, no holiday pay, which is 8% of total pay, no pension to pay, which is 10% to 12% of total pay, no requirement to pay for bank holidays, sick leave, redundancy or the administration costs of payroll, including PAYE and PRSI, no recruitment or advertising costs, no disputes with employees, that is, unfair dismissals - there are no rights there - and the ability to hire and off-hire staff at one hour's notice throughout the country.  The expression &quot;off-hire&quot; is wonderful.  I had never heard of before.  It is a bit like the expression &quot;downsizing&quot;.  It means firing or getting rid of people.  This is a pretty atrocious advertisement because every single thing listed is a violation of workers' rights.  I know there is some kind of commission or inquiry in place, but it is not a full one and I am not satisfied it is completely independent.  Will the Leader to contact the relevant Minister and ask that there be a full-blooded inquiry?  Why should 50% of workers in the construction industry be so disadvantaged?<\/p><p>It is time we examined the issue of self-employed people.  We always talking about entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises doing so much work for the country and that they are the engine on which we will rely for the recovery.  If somebody who has created jobs and employed people becomes unemployed, he or she receives nothing.  That is an utter disgrace.  Such people should be looked after in the same manner as everybody else in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200013#R00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1454427900,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I welcome Councillor David Maxwell from County Monaghan and former councillor, Noel Maxwell, to the Gallery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200013#R00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1454427900,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The Maxwell family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200013#R00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1454427900,"counter":110,"content":"<p>A man who deserves to be honoured, praised and remembered today is the gracious veteran broadcaster Terry Wogan who, as we all know, died after a short battle with cancer.<\/p> <p>This divine Irishman from Limerick, born with a sunny disposition, stole all our hearts with his beautiful distinctive voice.

I understand the Minister may not be available today but, hopefully, she may be available tomorrow.  The issue concerns allegations of abuse within a foster home, and particularly what the HSE knew and when.  First, I want to put on record that my heart goes out to the woman at the centre of this case who has become known as Grace and to her family because she suffered horrendously.  Of course, the fault of that lies with her abuser, but it also lies with the HSE for its woeful failings and dereliction of duty in protecting her and, potentially, others also.<\/p>  <p>Like Senator Bacik, I commend the whistleblowers for giving Grace a voice that, due to the nature of her disability, she was unable to use for herself.  I have spent the past year and a half urging people to come forward to speak about their abuse in order that they can get help but also in order that they break the cycle of what happened to them.  The most disturbing fact about this case is that this woman was physically unable to do so.  The HSE had a duty to protect her and it failed her miserably.  One would think after everything we know about abuse by powerful institutions in this county and after everything that we know about the systemic and horrific abuse of children, that somewhere some lessons would have been learned.  The reality, of course, is that they appear not to have been learned.  That is appalling and disgraceful.<\/p>  <p>I also want to deal with the wrong information given to the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to an apology which has not been given to Grace.  At best there was a misunderstanding and at worst it was wilful misleading of this committee.  It stinks to me of cover-up.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is to be applauded, as are the Ministers of State who have served in that Department, and the Minister's officials, who have worked diligently to ensure An Action Plan for Jobs was driven from the top and bought into by all members of the Cabinet.

As it will probably be my last time speaking on the Order of Business, certainly in this term, and as I feel it has always been my duty here to raise issues and anomalies that concern me, I want to raise one such issue today.  I have a constituent who is 19 years of age.  He has been accepted for an access to education course in the University of Limerick.  The course runs for 13 weeks.  He was unemployed.  He chose to take up the course in order that he could get into full-time education and to a degree course next year.  He has a grant of &euro;400 for the 13 weeks.  He has lost his social welfare payment of &euro;100 per week.  His father, who is an unemployed blocklayer, is now claiming &euro;29 per week for his son on unemployment assistance.  It is costing the family &euro;180 per week in lodgings, travel and food to keep him in Limerick.  He does not qualify for a back to education payment because he is under 21.  Therefore, in the 13 weeks there is a shortfall to the family of &euro;1,563.<\/p>  <p>This course is designed to allow this young man to do one module in his chosen subject of aircraft maintenance and would also allow him to get into a full course next year if he passes the first course.  However, by far the most astonishing aspect of all this is that the course is specifically for people from disadvantaged areas, and this man is from such an area.  How can he sustain himself financially without the required financial support?  Will the Leader bring this to the attention of the relevant Minister in order that this anomaly can be closed off.  It is proof that we have done a lot of work in government in getting people back into education, but this is an example of more work that needs to be done, and I hope the Government is returned in order that we can deal with those issues into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200015#U00300","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1454428800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Mary Ann O'Brien for those very kind words, which I appreciate greatly.

I support colleagues' comments in this regard.  Senator Quinn has done the State some service, which is a quip that was made by somebody else.  If we look back at the Senator's history in this House and the legislation he has brought through, we see it is true in his case.  Only last week, he brought forward a Bill on the regulation of drones.  Senator Quinn is never one to drone on and bore people; his contributions are always very relevant and exciting.  Senator David Norris is not here at the moment but I hope he will be back.  I saw him on television the other night.  He and Senator Quinn are two of the most senior Members of the Oireachtas and that seniority has very evidently brought wisdom in both their cases.<\/p><p>In my first week in the Seanad in 2011, I spoke about the importance of education, particularly early childhood education.  A report today in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by Peter McGuire points to the difference in funding for primary, secondary and third level education.  The author notes that primary schools receive 92 cent per pupil per day while secondary schools receive twice that.  For every &euro;8 spent on primary education, &euro;11 is spent at secondary level and &euro;15 at third level.  Primary school certainly is a very important time in a child's life because it impacts strongly on  formation of character, educational attainment and so on.  However, the preschool period is more important again in this regard and every &euro;1 spent in that area is vital.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader for a debate on this.  The rates are &euro;62 per week per child, or &euro;73 if the person has a level 6 preschool qualification, but the teachers are not paid and the education system as a whole is left to the private sector.  I want a full debate.  I started here in 2011 stating there should be early childhood education for every child, not just for children of working parents but for every child because zero to three and three to six are the most important formative times in a child's life.  I recognise what the Ministers, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald and Deputy James Reilly, have done in government because we have moved a long way, but we still have a long way to go.  I want to see it first thing on the agenda for the new Government that we will have a serious debate on the funding and importance of early childhood care and education as related to this.  It is shown that it pays back.  For every euro spent, one gets &euro;10 back, so it is not investing money in nothing.  It is investing money in the future of our country.<\/p> <p>I do not have time obviously to say anything about Terry Wogan, but Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200017#W00200","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454429700,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I will not be here tomorrow to attend Senator Quinn's party.

Two things come together from today's debate that were on my mind coming in here.  One is the casualisation, to which Senator Norris adverted, and the other is the employment figures.  There is no doubt the Government must be congratulated on the number of people who have been returned to work, but we still have 321,000 people on the live register, more than 81,000 people on activation programmes and more than 41,000 single parents drawing welfare in this country.  One wonders what the situation would be had the 600,000 people who emigrated not done so.  The point I am making is not a criticism of the Government, as it must be complimented, but the job of work for the forthcoming Government will again be massive and the job is far from over.<\/p>  <p>My heart sank a few minutes ago.  Senator Wilson adverted to the fact the D&aacute;il might be dissolved tomorrow.  I can confirm it will be.  The Taoiseach announced on Midwest Radio that he will go to the park tomorrow.  This saddens me greatly.  It means I must start wearing the rubber on my car tyres to get around the country.  We will deal with that when the time comes.<\/p>  <p>The issue of zero-hour contracts will have to be dealt with by the next Government.  The issue of those who do not feature on the live register, those who would attend activation or education programmes but cannot access them because they are not on the live register, will have to be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>I support Senator Cahill.  The one question I ask is why somebody is not in jail when we speak about this lady, Grace.  We then find out a second person was involved in the same house of horrors.  There is something terribly wrong in this country if this type of thing can go on and it is left unsaid.<\/p>  <p>I wish everybody well.

I have raised this issue on numerous occasions in the House.  Since it was centralised, it has caused enormous problems for people and an enormous amount of stress for them in trying to get their full entitlement.  Two weeks ago I raised the issue here that people on the rural social scheme, under the guidelines, are entitled to retain their medical cards, as are their wives and children.  I had two cases over the past ten days where people's wives and children were refused cards because of very low income.  Since then these decisions have been reversed, but there was nothing in the guidelines allowing this to be done in the first place.  Now I see young people on the dole are being refused medical cards.  A 23 year old on &euro;100 a week, which is the maximum rate of unemployment assistance he can get, is being refused a medical card.  There is no legislative basis whatsoever for this.  I call on the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister, and have it on the agenda.<\/p> <p>The next Government must, as part of its agenda, review the way the PCRS does its business because it seems quite clear it is making it up as it goes along and taking a chance on refusing medical cards.  Some people believe its decision that they are not entitled to a medical card, with the consequence that they go away and do not get their full entitlement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200018#X00500","speaker":"1161","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454430300,"counter":137,"content":"<p>There has been much discussion and focus in the House for some time on drugs and excessive drinking.  I wish to turn my attention to the latter.  There is a need for the Government to take a much firmer hand in trying to dissuade people, particularly the young, from consuming alcohol to excess.  A hotel owner who is a friend of mine said to me some years ago that if we were fortunate enough to have had a couple of quid in our pockets when we were young and went out to drink, we might have got drunk, but nowadays the intent of young people is not just to drink but to get drunk and become blotto.  There is too close an association between sport and alcohol.  A campaign was mounted lately to try to remove the prohibition on selling alcohol on certain days.  I believe the Government should consider having more days on which there is a prohibition, especially around holiday weekends when there are sports events.  The level of hardship drinking causes individuals and families is enormous.  We need to interfere and not just surrender to the drinks trade totally.  We need to be a little more courageous than we are.<\/p>  <p>I join those Senators who expressed their concerns over the sex abuse scandals associated with fostering in the south east.  This will probably be replicated in other areas.  I concur fully with Senator Daly&rsquo;s point that there needs to be greater accountability to ensure the protection of children.  It does not exist.  Obviously in this case it did not exist.  It is interesting that this matter has come to light only through people leaking details to their politicians.  In other words, it was with luck.  I hope there will be a full investigation.  It looks as if the HSE itself was trying to cover up.  There is a lesson in that for us in that, at local level, some accountability tiers need to be built in for the HSE.  At county level, perhaps, there needs to be a forum at which those concerned can be held to account not only for the type of activity in question but also for all the services delivered locally.  This is not happening and the issues are becoming national issues.<\/p>  <p>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.  Over recent weeks, I have sought a debate on housing to deal with various issues, including homelessness, local authority and social housing provision, the problems faced by distressed mortgage holders and the difficulties young people have in obtaining a mortgage.  I propose a debate on this subject immediately following the discussion on the banking inquiry report today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200019#Y00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1454430300,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Is the amendment to seek a debate on housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200019#Y00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1454430300,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I am seeking a general debate on housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200019#Y00400","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1454430300,"counter":140,"content":"<p>As we are coming to the end of this term, it is fitting to wish all the very best to the people whom I am aware are not standing in the forthcoming election.  They have been fantastic colleagues.  I include Senators Walsh, Crown, Gilroy and Quinn.  I acknowledge Senator Quinn's 23 years of service.  He and the Cathaoirleach were elected on the same day in 1993.  I congratulate both of them.  It is ironic that the anniversary is the day the D&aacute;il is to be dissolved.  I also acknowledge Senator Norris, the father of the House.<\/p>  <p>We have done and achieved quite an amount here in our five years but, of course, there is always a lot more to be done.  In this regard, I am thinking about education.  A matter that arises quite frequently in my office concerns those who wish to go back to college and qualify for the back-to-education allowance but who miss out on it because they have not been on the jobseeker's payment or social welfare for the required period.<\/p> <p>A situation arises where somebody has to be on welfare for nine months and may be on it for eight months and two weeks.  It is a ridiculous situation where they do not qualify and are not in a position to take up the offer of a college place.  We need to instill flexibility within the system to help people who are on social welfare and who want to go back to work.  It also applies to those in general who are in employment but want to go back to education.  Maybe their employment is not remunerating them to the degree they should be remunerated and they are going back to education to better themselves.  However, because they are in employment they do not qualify.<\/p> <p>We need to instill flexibility within the guidelines and the qualifications and I also extend that to SUSI.  To be fair to SUSI, three or four years ago we were all inundated with queries, complaints, difficulties and challenges concerning the SUSI application system but it is down to single figures now.  There are always exceptional cases and when there are exceptional cases one needs exceptional flexibility and a commonsense approach.<\/p> <p>For the next term I certainly want to see at Government level a far greater emphasis on education.  There is a buoyancy out there now and I want to see any young person helped who has a desire, an ambition, intent and the ability to engage in education - be it university degrees or apprenticeships.  I acknowledge the Labour Party and T&aacute;naiste Joan Burton's speech, which I watched on Saturday night, and her commitment to creating thousands of apprenticeships if the party is re-elected to Government.  In theory and in philosophy all parties across the political divide would sign up to that.  It should be an all party agreement that we need to revolutionise and create far more apprenticeships.<\/p> <p>I will conclude on the phenomenal growth in tourism that is taking place.  There is an argument for the return of CERT.  It was a fantastic way of training chefs and people within the hospitality industry.  I cannot understand for the life of me why it was discontinued but we need to reignite CERT.  It would bring back quality to the hospitality, catering and tourism industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200019#Y00500","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454430600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>One of the important things from the last five years, which was referred to by Senator Mullins already, was the growth in the number of people at work.  It was one of the challenges faced by this Cabinet and the Government.  It is a huge achievement to now have unemployment rates down to 8.6% and a huge growth in the number of people at work.  It will not be too long before we have over 2 million people working.  When we joined the European Union we had only 1 million people working back in the 1970s.  However, we need to ensure that we continue along that path.<\/p>  <p>We have major challenges facing us no matter who is in government.  By the time the incoming Government leaves office there will be over 100,000 more people over the age of 65.  There will be more demand on pensions and on the health care sector.  When one looks at the health care sector, 51% of all people in hospital are over the age of 65.  Over the next 14 years the numbers of over 65s will increase from 600,000 currently to over 990,000.  We will have huge demands in the health care area because of this change in demographics.  In order to fund that we also have to have more people at work.  It is not just about reducing the number of people who are unemployed, it is also about continuing to grow the number of people who are employed and available for employment.<\/p>  <p>I am very saddened that we have not made progress on the issue of people to whom we provide a comprehensive education but who, once they have finished in universities, are emigrating within a short time, particularly our junior doctors.  We now have a major challenge in that area.  There are problems when hospitals employ junior doctors under agency contracts and junior doctors are no longer getting the level of pay they should get for the work they do.<\/p> <p>They are not getting the same level of support to engage in further education and training.  It is disappointing that no progress has been made in this area in the past four years.  The new Government must prioritise this issue.  As well as providing funding for education, we must also offer health service staff attractive employment conditions.  This will convince them to stay in Ireland and further their education in the health sector and ensure we do not rely on overseas doctors for hospital and general practice services.  The next Government must adopt this issue as a priority and Members of the next Seanad must continue to raise and work on it in the next five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016020200020#Z00200","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1454430900,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I second Senator Jim Walsh's amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>  <p>The issue of road safety crosses my mind often because a large number of people, particularly cyclists and pedestrians, are killed on the roads.  I raised the issue at the start of the session.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government my request that he make high visibility vests compulsory for cyclists and pedestrians.  I understand that, on average, approximately 50 of the people killed on the roads each year are not wearing high visibility vests.  I frequently drive in rural areas.  When negotiating country roads, especially at this time of year when we have a great deal of fog, rain and mist, it can be difficult when one encounters a walker or cyclist without a visibility vest.  Many rules and regulations are in place governing safety in cars.  The possibility of making visibility vests mandatory should be considered.  I am not advocating for a nanny state but if this measure could save one or two lives each year, it should be made compulsory.  Perhaps a pilot project could be introduced for children making the journey to and from school.

Ultimately, the saying that one can lead a horse to water but one cannot make him drink applies.

IDA Ireland has a difficult job and has played an excellent role in recent years in creating jobs and assisting companies to locate in Ireland.
