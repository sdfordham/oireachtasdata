I understand Deputy Calleary, in his contribution on Second Stage, indicated that the Minister should consider a simplified version of the independent accountant's report and the application papers for the appointment of an examiner to streamline the application process.  The current court process mirrors the requirements of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 in respect of the appointment of an examiner.  Section 3 of that Act requires that a petition for the appointment of an examiner be accompanied by a report prepared by an independent accountant.  Section 3(3)(b) sets out the areas the report is required to cover.<\/p><p>  The Bill does not propose to change these arrangements because the report of the independent accountant is essential to assist the court in determining whether the company has a reasonable prospect of survival.  If the court is not satisfied that the company as a whole or any part of the undertaking has a reasonable prospect of survival as a going concern, it is precluded from making an order appointing an examiner.  Thus, the independent accountant's report is a crucial piece of evidence for the court to consider.  It should explain, in a reasoned manner, why the independent accountant is of the view that the company, and the whole or part of its undertaking, has a reasonable prospect of survival.<\/p><p>  The report must have regard to a number of important matters, as detailed in section 3(3)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990.  The appointment of an examiner to a company will interfere with the rights of creditors and it is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the independent accountant's report provides evidence that will satisfy the court that the company has a reasonable prospect of survival as a going concern and whether a compromise or scheme of arrangement with creditors would offer such a prospect of survival.  Modifying the terms which underpin the report would create a significant risk that the rights of creditors and their businesses, which may also have employees, would be impacted further as the evidential threshold would be lower.  The Office of Parliamentary Counsel has also advised that allowing the Minister to alter the arrangements in question by way of a statutory instrument would not legally be permissible as it would exceed the extent to which matters can be delegated to a Minister, having regard to the Constitution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2013120500002#A00800","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1386239400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2013120500003#B00400","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1386239400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I accept that amendments Nos. 2 and 3 have been ruled out of order, but there is no sense in us introducing this new system with all its attractions if it will end up being a cash cow for professional services.

These will provide for further disclosure of actual and potential costs to clients of any proceedings for which the legal practitioner is being engaged.  That Bill is introducing a series of enhanced transparency measures on legal costs and is the appropriate vehicle for debate on the legal costs aspect of this.<\/p><p>  In broader terms, it would not seem appropriate that the responsible regulator for the professions involved would advertise the fees of individual practitioners.  This would be open to all types of misinterpretation, including, perhaps, a quasi-endorsement of the fees concerned.  Alternatively, it could lead to the fees so publicised becoming set <i>minima<\/i> which, in effect, could impede competition among the relevant service providers who would have an officially published price list to hide behind.  There is an inherent danger there.

I do not think there is room for tax cuts or expenditure increases in budget 2015.  As I noted in my statement the council believes that the current plans for &euro;2 billion in additional adjustments should be followed through.  If growth comes out as anticipated, we should be okay with an effectively neutral budget in 2016 without the need for additional measures.  In chapter four of our report we have looked forward in time to 2019 in order to gauge the room for expansionary measures that will ensure full compliance with all fiscal rules.  We ran scenarios for doing the minimum consolidation necessary in order to achieve all the fiscal rules and to see what level of both nominal and real expansion - which could be split between tax cuts and expenditure increases - would be possible.  We see limited room, post-2016.  There will be greater room for nominal adjustments and less room when taking into account that there is likely to be inflation occurring over that period as a result of the real impact of those expenditure and tax changes.<\/p><p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we really do not see scope in the next year or two but if growth projections pan out as currently anticipated, there could well be scope after 2016.  <\/p><p>  On the question about the advice given by the council, the frequent comment is that we are being ignored.  However, it should be noted that we have been broadly supportive of the Government's fiscal strategy which has succeeded in stabilising the public finances and restoring the borrowing capacity of the State.  The disagreements have come more on the fine tuning of fiscal policy which will include this decision of whether to do &euro;3.1 billion or &euro;2.5 billion.  The fine tuning involves balancing acts.  We can understand that the Government might make a different balancing of the factors than we did.  The Government takes our analysis on board when making a decision but when it comes to those fine tuning decisions, if the Government does not follow exactly our analysis, we do not consider that this means it is ignoring our advice.

We have also talked about having some margin of safety in regard to those key deficit targets because much of the improvement in the creditworthiness of the State and the return of our borrowing capacity has been achieved because we have met those key targets and there is a good deal of focus particularly on that 3% deficit target for 2015.

It is not possible to predict with any degree of confidence, no matter how great a statistician one is, when the turning point will come.

Is that not opening us up more to the risks when, if what we need is insulation against the risks, we should be trying to shore up our economy to be able to better weather a situation where the downside risks materialise?  To give an example of that, and I would be interested to hear Professor McHale's comment on this, property prices are beginning rise, perhaps somewhat surprisingly at present, and some of us are concerned that a property bubble is beginning to develop again.  I note alarmingly that we have a property-based tax incentive, called real estimate investment trusts, which is technocratic language for enabling big corporate property investors to invest in the bottomed out property in the Irish economy and essentially speculate on making money out of it.

If we were to close ourselves off, it would reduce volatility but it probably would also substantially reduce average growth rates.  The successful phases of Irish growth have been the adoption of outward orientated policies starting in 1950s and the good phase of recent Irish growth in the 1990s was again very much due to the success of the export part of the economy.

There is hardly any credit.  What appears to be happening is that those who had accumulated savings, Irish expatriates and others who lived abroad and those who had sold property at the height of the boom - one must remember that for everybody who bought a property, somebody sold it and the money went somewhere - may now be coming back into the market because a high proportion of the sales are in cash.

We need to maintain fiscal sobriety in this debate and dampen down expectations because with talk of exiting the bailout there is almost a daily commentary about when we can roll back some of the austerity measures that have been implemented.

The Deputy is correct that the construction industry is operating at a reduced level and house building is way below historic norms.  Professor Alan Barrett has a better sense of the figures.  An overly expanded construction sector did damage in the past but we are very far away from it now.  It would be welcome to see the supply response, which need not come only from the private sector and could involve public investment.

On the one hand, we absolutely recognise that more fiscal adjustment hurts the economy in the short term.  It reduces demand which is not what we need at the moment.  If there were no other constraints we would be calling for less fiscal adjustment, not more.  We also know that, not that long ago, the Irish economy lost its credit worthiness.  There were real risks of default.  The implied probability of default in mid-2011 was close to 90%.  If Ireland had defaulted, the international evidence indicates - even though it does not always speak with one voice - that the costs of defaults are very large.  It would send the crisis into another vicious phase.<\/p><p>  One way to help regain that credit worthiness and avoid default is to improve one's fiscal position faster.  Even the fear of default raises interest rates, which have knock-on effects on the banking system so in itself it can be contractionary even in the short term.  This was the balancing act that underlay our thinking about what the appropriate fiscal stance is.  Over time that trade-off is changing and the State's credit worthiness has been substantially restored.  However, it goes back to some of the risk factors we discussed before.  We do not want to undo many of those benefits by starting to miss key targets.  There is also ongoing uncertainty concerning the eurozone so the crisis could flare up again.  We are continually re-evaluating that particular trade-off.  <\/p><p>  Members of the committee may recall that we had been calling for more adjustment in the past at a time when the State was clearly not credit worthy and that trade-off was much less favourable.  We have eased back on what we have been recommending in terms of adjustment.  The key now is to hit those key targets we have agreed to.  As regards the Deputy's basic point on the importance of supporting demand in an economy that is still in recession, we are in full agreement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013120500013#M00600","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speech","time":1386257700,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.

I find that most of the sectoral Departments have been completely unreformed since 2008.  As a professional outside body, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has to draw attention to that from time to time.

We are all aware of the impact of the statement by the ECB&rsquo;s president, Mr. Draghi, in 2012 in stabilising the euro and bringing down bond yields for Ireland and other eurozone countries.

I raised the issue of real estate investments trusts last year at the budget and again this year.  Could the witnesses comment on that?  As I understand it, this is a model that has essentially been adopted from the US where there are worrying signs it could be producing a bubble.  I think this is a very dangerous development.  It also relates to a larger conundrum discussed here and the issue of growthless jobs, which we also discussed with the Department of Finance and which I raised with the Minister for Finance during the budget discussions.  What the witnesses have said in summary is that we need growth to hit our targets but we cannot get growth without investment and we are not getting much investment because of the austerity requirements.  This begs the question of who invests.  As Dr. Donovan rightly pointed out, the only people who really have the money to invest now are those who made a fortune and were left standing after the crash.  They are the only ones with money.  They probably do have access to credit.   The little guy has no access to credit but they have access to it.  What they are doing is buying up bargain basement stuff left lying around after the crisis.  The very people who caused it are now buying up everything at the bottom of the market so they can start the whole process again.  Government policy is facilitating that.  That is a very worrying development because it is a recipe for spectacular profits for them rather than investment directed towards real growth in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013120500015#O00400","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1386258900,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Is there a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013120500015#O00500","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1386258900,"counter":196,"content":"<p>Is that not a very worrying development and is it not happening?

To improve the investment climate, one thing we certainly need is credit growth but credit being channelled to people who will make these productive investments.  The Deputy makes an important and very relevant distinction between people who are just interested in investing in assets that are already there and those who wish to invest in new productive assets that will create more activity in the economy and support long-run growth.  There needs to be a focus on investment and what the obstacles to it are.  The most important thing at the moment is probably the credit system which requires that we have a well-functioning banking system which needs to be adequately capitalised.<\/p><p>  It may be a little unpopular to say this but Japan made a huge mistake when it went through a similar crisis.  In an early phase of the crisis, the state had to put capital into banks and there was a huge public backlash as one would expect and which certainly occurred here.  In the later stages of the crisis, the banks again got into a lot of trouble.  They were severely under-capitalised which was having a very adverse effect on their credit system and, ultimately, on levels of investment in the economy but because there was such a huge backlash to the earlier capital injections, it left the banking system severely under-capitalised.  The hope would be the banks do not need more capital but we must see what happens when the ECB's comprehensive assessment takes place next year.  We certainly hope that whatever capital needs there are would come from the private sector and failing that, from the ESM.  Due to the fact it is so critical to have a well-functioning banking system and because a properly and adequately capitalised banking system is so central to that functioning, it is something that will have to be looked at carefully and not left under-capitalised because of the very bad hangover from the huge amounts of capital that went in before.  The Deputy's general point about focusing on investment and what might be holding it back is very important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013120500015#O00700","nonspeaker":"Professor John McHale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386258900,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I just wanted to comment on investment because investment projections are actually quite strong.  There is obviously a very important issue around investment in the domestic economy.  One of the upsides of Ireland's openness is precisely the ability to attract capital from other places and the fact that this means that much of the productive investment in the economy is not particularly reliant on the domestic banking system but reliant on the international banking system.  The international banking system is not doing a particularly good job either but, on average, it is in better shape than the domestic system.  Coming from the outside, I find it surprising how strong some of the machinery of investment has really been, once one strips out the aircraft.  Ireland seems to be relatively successful at capturing a disproportionate share of the investment that is going on around the place.

In respect of the analysis of the forecasts, did the council factor in the patent cliff and the question of how GDP is now being measured?  Is there a possibility that the methodology used to measure GDP is flawed?  It has a huge impact because growth determines everything for us as a country, particularly when we are on the trajectory of coming out and meeting targets.  Growth is the key factor on every level in terms of how the bond markets look at us and meeting the 3% debt-to-GDP target.  I am asking a technical question in terms of how growthless jobs are being measured because historically there was always a lag behind the growth in GDP with jobs coming on stream?  We now find the opposite is true but we are finding that they are real jobs and there is growth.  I suspect this growth in jobs is not applying where an economy is in negative growth.

Of course, if that happened there might be a policy response which would be taken into account, or money might be found through the Bank of Ireland or other routes.  It is not allowing for that but it is saying that extra would be needed.  An important question in regard to growth is why it might be weak.

This will form an essential part of macro-economic management given what the sector did previously.  Bankers definitely should have been regulated to prevent the behaviour that obtained under the previous system.  We have a Bill on the Seanad Order Paper to provide those powers.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Kate O'Flaherty, who is now heading up the health and well-being programme in the Department which, as the committee will be aware, is a new unit established to drive the implementation of Healthy Ireland which was approved by Government in the early part of this year.  Kate comes to us from the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.  She is both a pharmacist and a journalist and she has responsibility for sexual health.<\/p><p>  On behalf of the Department, I welcome the opportunity to be here today, in particular, to brief the committee on the development of the national sexual health strategy, which is the context in policy terms for our consideration of the issues this morning and which is currently being finalised.<\/p><p>  The implementation of that strategy will be undertaken by the health and well-being division of the HSE, and Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe and her team from the HSE will speak to that.  They will be supported by the key stakeholders in the area.  The strategy and its implementation are underpinned by the goals and principles of the Healthy Ireland framework which I have mentioned already.<\/p><p>  This new strategy is the first time that a nationally co-ordinated approach has been developed to address sexual health and well-being and to reduce negative health outcomes, including in the specific area of HIV.  The strategy's vision is that everyone in Ireland experiences positive sexual health and well-being, and has access to high quality sexual health information, education and services throughout the life course.  The strategy takes a life course approach, which is consistent with the underpinning concept in the Healthy Ireland framework, and acknowledges the importance of developing healthy sexuality throughout childhood and adolescence and builds on that foundation for positive sexual health and well-being into adult hood and older age.<\/p><p>  Sexual health is an important part of overall health.  It means in the first place the absence of disease and infection but also covers well-being, the ability to control fertility and to have children and the ability to enjoy fulfilling relationships free from discrimination.<\/p><p>  Worldwide, sexually transmitted infections, STIs, are among the most common causes of disease and are an increasing cause of ill health.  Apart from the initial symptoms and discomfort, they may result in long-term health problems such as infertility, ectopic pregnancies and genital cancers.  In Ireland, rising STI rates have increased the level of concern in this area among health professionals, the Government and the public, and are something we are certainly concerned about.<\/p><p>  Sexual health infections prevention and treatment services include a broad range of health care at different levels, both public and private, throughout the health care system.  The main elements include: prevention of sexually transmitted infections and clinical care for those with STIs; contraception; screening for diseases such as genital chlamydia; psychosexual counselling and support; and specialised services for high-risk groups and diseases.<\/p><p>  HSE public STI screening services are almost exclusively based in hospitals and special community clinic settings around Ireland and they are free at the point of access.  In places, some GP practices and family planning services may provide STI services for a fee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386236400,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I also welcome Dr. Kate O'Flaherty.

The division provides people with knowledge, services and supports to help them live healthier and more fulfilled lives.  The division includes public health departments, health protection services, child health, health promotion and improvement services, environmental health services, emergency management and health intelligence.  National frameworks and strategies such as Future Health, and Healthy Ireland - A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025 underline the commitments at national level and service wide to increasing the proportion of people who are healthy at all stages of life, reducing health inequalities, protecting the public from threats to health and well-being, and creating an environment where individuals and all sectors of society can play their part in achieving a healthy Ireland. <\/p><p>  Improved health and well-being, importantly, is one of four pillars of reform outlined in Future Health.  This pillar of reform demarcates a shift in policy, service design and practice away from simply treating sick people to also keeping people healthy.  The new division will work with the director general and other national directors to ensure health service reforms result in a greater focus on disease prevention, early detection and intervention and self-care.<\/p><p>  One of a number of priorities in 2014 for the division is to review the co-ordination, effectiveness and impact of sexual health services and preventive work.  We plan to build on the existing capacity and expertise that we have in the area of sexual health, in health promotion and improvement and public health within the division and with our colleagues in primary care, social inclusion and acute hospitals to improve co-ordination in this area.  We also plan to identify a clinical lead to look at sexual health services and improve standardisation in this area.  This work will be aligned, as appropriate, across the service divisions of the health service.  We will continue to take a strong and strategic partnership approach to addressing sexual health issues involving key stakeholders ranging from other Departments, professional bodies, academia, NGOs, the media and all the groups represented at the meeting.<\/p><p>  The work of the health service in this area in more recent times has been guided by the NASC and three national strategies dealing with the prevention of crisis pregnancy.  As Dr. Holohan pointed out, the Department of Health established a steering committee and we worked closely with the Department and other stakeholders in developing the draft strategy.  A significant volume work is undertaken every day across the health service and by a range of partners across the statutory, non-statutory and community sectors in the area of sexual health.  This work is focused on preventing negative sexual health outcomes from unplanned pregnancy to STIs and HIV-AIDS.  This work is targeted towards at-risk and vulnerable groups and has been informed by a robust research and information agenda over the past ten years.<\/p><p>  Surveillance is an essential part of any framework to support and inform the delivery of sexual health services and supports.  Surveillance of STIs and HIV, in particular, has improved in recent years due to the work of clinicians, departments of public health and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC.  I refer to trends in HIV diagnoses.  In 2012, 341 newly-diagnosed HIV cases were reported in Ireland, which equates to a rate of 7.4 per 100,000 population and represents a 7% increase on the 2011 figure of 319.  This reversed a downward trend since 2008.  A total of 6,629 cases of HIV have been reported in Ireland since the early 1980s.  This figure does not represent the number of people living with HIV in Ireland, as it does not take into account factors such as migration or death.  Among the reported new cases in 2012, the median age is 33, with the majority male.  The probable route of HIV acquisition is men having sex with men, MSM, in 48.7% of cases.  This is the largest group and this figure has been increasing since 2004.  In addition, 38.1% of new cases were acquired heterosexually and 3.8% through intravenous drug use. <\/p><p>  The health service has a strategic objective to improve knowledge and awareness of sexual health and relationships through the delivery of targeted communication campaigns, customised information and educational programmes and other initiatives across a range of settings.  This is achieved through the ongoing management, funding and evaluation of communication campaigns and education and prevention programmes.  It is also achieved through significant partnerships with, for example, the Department of Education and Skills and the out of school sector and service providers.<\/p><p>  The health promotion and improvement service has more recently worked with the Gay Health Network , GHN, on a two-year campaign targeting MSM to destigmatise HIV, reduce homophobia, and encourage early testing and taking protective measures to reduce risks.  Public health services, through the gonorrhoea control group, are engaged in information campaigns for MSM.  A social media campaign for sexually active young heterosexual adults encouraging safer sex is planned to go live on 9 December.  In addition, the HSE crisis pregnancy programme launched a new phase of its Think Contraception campaign last month to encourage consistent use of condoms and other forms of contraception among sexually active young adults.  This phase of the campaign directly addresses both unplanned pregnancy and STIs. <\/p><p>  The health service is involved in a number of education initiatives targeted at specific audiences from parents, teachers, youth workers and young people to improve knowledge and skills around relationships and sexuality as part of its approach to improve sexual health and well-being and to reduce stigma and negative sexual health outcomes.  This has involved significant inputs in the area of relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social personal health education, SPHE, in schools and working very much in partnership with the Department of Education and skills and in out of school settings through work with National Youth Council of Ireland, Foroige and Youthreach, among others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386237000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Keeffe for her presentation.

I will examine the figures and talk about some of the trends that are emerging.  The most recent full-year data is for 2012.  As regard gay and bisexual men and MSM, in recent years we have seen a significant rise in the rates of diagnosis.  In 2005 we had 60 cases, while last year we had 161 cases.  That represents a 160% increase in diagnosis rates in that time period.  It is not a random spike, but a clear trend if one examines the graphs I have included in the document.<\/p><p>  In 2010, for the first time, MSM became the largest population group of new HIV diagnosis rates, with 48% of new cases last year.  For the first six months of this year we are roughly at 50% again, so unfortunately the trend continues building on previous years.<\/p><p>  Figures for the first six months of this year show that the trend is still continuing.  We had 72 cases of HIV in MSM diagnosed in that period, which is up to 82 this year.  <\/p><p>  A key point is that the median age at which people are being diagnosed is getting lower.  That trend has been happening consistently in recent years, to the point where for the first six months of this year the median age for young gay and bisexual men being diagnosed is 31.  There is also a time lapse between when one gets a condition and when it is diagnosed.  We can therefore take it that people are contracting the condition at a slightly lower age than 31.  <\/p><p>  The figures show that there is a significant issue for a specific group of people - gay and bisexual men.  Within that group, that can be targeted down to younger gay and bisexual men.  We know that from the statistics which are very good in Ireland.  We have a good information gathering service with the HPSC.  <\/p><p>  Building on the figures, what do we do to address the situation?  We can examine two key areas.  First, we need to raise awareness about HIV for groups that are most at risk.  Second, we need to get people to access sexual health services so that they can make the best possible decisions and get the best sexual health outcomes.  <\/p><p>  One of the key points about raising awareness is through the kind of campaigns the committee will hear about from other groups.  Those must be targeted to groups most in need.  We are no longer in the 1980s or 1990s where generations could remember blanket radio and television campaigns about HIV and AIDS.  Those resources simply do not exist nowadays.  It is now about taking what resources are there and focusing them on groups that are most at risk.<\/p><p>  The other key part of raising awareness is through education.  There is a good curriculum on sexual health, which is caused the Trust curriculum that was developed in Ireland.  One of the challenges, however, is that it is not being taught everywhere.  The question, therefore, is how can we address the barriers that prevent it from being taught.  Why do people feel uncomfortable teaching the course?  Young people in secondary school are a captive audience who can be furnished with the information they need to make the best possible decisions for themselves.  No more than in all parts of health, this is about giving people information and the capacity to deliver on their own health outcomes in so far as they can.<\/p><p>  Engaging with health services is a critical element.  We know that when people contract HIV, they are most contagious in the early stages.  It can be passed on more easily in the early stages but, unfortunately, that is the time when one is least likely to know one's status.  We need, therefore, to get people to know their status.  People must be able to engage with sexual health services and get tested.  The quicker people know their status the less likely it is that HIV will be passed on.  Most HIV is passed on by people who simply do not know they have it.  We must be able to address that problem which is about engaging with services. <\/p><p>  Just as we talk about addressing barriers to teaching the curriculum, one of the key things about getting people to engage with sexual health services is by trying to address barriers that stop people from doing so.  There are significant social barriers for all people to engage with their sexual health services, but most especially for gay and bisexual men.  Many recommendations in previous reports have been developed through NASC and the education prevention committee, discussing how best to engage with those services.  Some of them are contained in our document.<\/p><p>  The key recommendations we suggest include continuing further campaigns on HIV prevention and raising awareness.  These must be targeted to groups at risk.  In addition, we need to develop and implement national campaigns to address the stigma and discrimination facing people living with HIV, and the knock-on effect that has in getting people to engage with services. <\/p><p>  We also recommend the completion of the national sexual health strategy.  I am glad to say that I am on the steering group of that strategy and it is wonderful to know it is coming close to completion.  We also need a proper analysis of the barriers preventing teachers from feeling that they can roll out the Trust curriculum to raise awareness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tiernan Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386237600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Quinlan, manager, Gay Men's Health Services, Health Service Executive, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500006#E00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386237600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>Gay Men's Health Services, GMHS, HSE, is a community-based service and remains the only statutory body providing dedicated sexual health service for gay and bisexual men and men who have sex with men, MSM, in all of Ireland and one of the few in Europe or worldwide.  The United Nations uses the term &ldquo;men who have sex with men&rdquo;, MSM, which covers gay and bisexual men, transgender people and sex workers.<\/p><p>  On October 6 1992 the Gay Men&rsquo;s Health Project, as it was then known, opened its first STI, sexually transmitted infection, clinic.  It became so busy that it went to operating two evenings a week in January 1993.  An important part of the service was an outreach service to the community and the provision of counselling services.  The outreach workers maintained HIV prevention and sexual health awareness in the community, various groups and agencies during the years.  The number of outreach workers has been reduced from four to one who is on a career incentive break.  Counselling was provided by one full-time person but is now provided by two sessional counsellors in five client sessions per week.  The GMHS STI clinical team of doctors, nurses, counsellors, health advisers and assistants are employed on a sessional basis for the two evenings per week.  They are engaged from agencies or individually, which has proved ideal for this type of service and is cost effective.  The medical team is trained in sexual health and many work in other STI services.  GMHS works in partnership with the GUIDE Clinic and the microbiology laboratory at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, as well as a consultant in infectious diseases providing medical direction.<\/p><p>  The GMHS STI checkpoint is based in Baggot Street Hospital, operates two evenings per week and is very busy.  Over 9,800 MSM have registered since 1997.  Up to 825 of these men were first\u2010time attendees, with 39% aged 24 years and younger, a significant increase of 20% in this age group when compared to 2011.  There was a 25% increase among men from counties Dublin, Fingal, Wicklow and Kildare.  STI screens numbered 3,672, with over 4,500 nursing contacts. There were 261 cases of gonorrhoea, a 43% increase when compared to 2011; 156 cases of chlamydia; 52 cases of HIV, a 37% increase when compared to 2011; and 56 cases of syphilis, a 22% increase when compared to 2011.<\/p><p>  The clients attending come from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds and travel from across all 32 counties.  For instance, between 2009 and 2012, of the 2,949 new registrations, 37% were born in Dublin, 26% in the rest of Ireland, while 37% were born abroad, covering 95 countries.  Since 2011 we have registered ethnic backgrounds.  In 2012, of the 825 new registrations, 85% identified as white, with the remainder being black African, Asian or of mixed race.   Both findings indicate much more diverse backgrounds among MSM than in the national census of 2011.<\/p><p>  During the years GMHS has helped to establish such groups as Gay Health Network, Outhouse, the LGBT community centre, the BeLonGTo youth service and others.  GMHS is part of the National AIDS Strategy Committee, NASC, and was represented on the service\u2010working group for the national sexual health strategy.  In 2009 GMHS was involved in producing the important document, LGBT Health: Towards meeting the Health Care Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People.<\/p><p>  Gay Health Action, GHA, initiated the response to AIDS and HIV in Ireland among homosexual and bisexual men in 1985.  It produced and disseminated information on transmission and also challenged the perception of AIDS as a gay disease.  It helped found the Lesbian Health Action, Cairde and AIDS Action Alliance, later Dublin AIDS Alliance.  GHA disbanded in 1989.  It is worth noting that it could not receive funding from the Department of Health or hold meetings with the then Minister because of the legal position on homosexuality.<\/p><p>  In 1989 the then Eastern Health Board established the AIDS Resource Centre at the Baggot Street Clinic providing a needle exchange programme and outreach services for intravenous drug users and free HIV testing for the general population.  GMHS was established in 1992 and was also based at the Baggot Street Clinic.  The AIDS Resource Centre had been renamed the AIDS-Drugs Service.  GMHS was also involved in the Lesbian and Gay Health Caucus from 1990 to 1992 which was based at Dublin AIDS Alliance.  <\/p><p>  The establishment of the Government&rsquo;s National AIDS Strategy Committee in 1992 was vital and recognised that the criminalisation of homosexuality inhibited promotional work in this field.  It also called for legislation to be amended to allow for the sale of condoms from vending machines.<\/p><p>  The Gay Health Network, GHN, was established in 1994 and is an all-Ireland network of agencies, organisations, individuals and MSM living with HIV.  All have a shared ethos and commitment to achieving the purposes of the network, sharing ideas, work, resources and experiences.  The main purpose of GHN is to promote HIV prevention and sexual health awareness among MSM, with a focus on men living with HIV, and to combat the stigma associated with HIV.  GHN and its members provide a range of front-line services.  The actions of the network are evidence\u2010based, strongly linked, developed and guided by accurate knowledge of the behaviour of MSM and are based on the findings and recommendations of research and relevant reports.  The Gay Health Forum has been held since 2000 with the support of the Department of Health and HSE - social inclusion.<\/p><p>  In Ireland HIV and other STI infections, particularly syphilis and gonorrhoea, are in high numbers among MSM.  This trend, with the Government&rsquo;s 2002 national AIDS strategy report and the education and prevention plan for the period 2008 to 2012, highlighted the need for actions with and for MSM.  In the 1980s and 1990s communities, including the gay community, were greatly affected by AIDS-related sickness, death and emigration.  Since the 2000s, with new treatments, various committees and the national AIDS strategy, efforts have been made to address the issue with some success.  Nevertheless, the increase in the level of HIV infection seems relentless and proves the need for continued investment in prevention and support and partnerships with various communities and groups such as the Gay Health Network.  Another issue is AIDS-related stigma and challenging this needs to be part of prevention awareness campaigns.<\/p><p>  Research is the key to planning and strategy.  In fact, GMHS was established as a result of a survey carried out in December 1991 of the Dublin gay scene.  The report published by the then Eastern Health Board on the 470 gay and bisexual male respondents showed that, although nearly half had been tested for HIV, two thirds had never been screened for a STI and 84% had never had the hepatitis B vaccine.  Since its establishment, GMHS has led on research among MSM in Ireland.  With GHN members, it has produced many of the research reports on health needs and HIV prevention and support services.<\/p><p>  The most recent report is on the European men who have sex with men Internet survey, published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, last May.  This was the largest survey of its kind in the world, with 180,000 respondents across 38 European countries, including 2,610 respondents from the island of Ireland, the largest number ever here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500006#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mick Quinlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386238200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I will be strict on time because Mr. Quinlan has eaten into the time available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500007#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386238200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>As Mr. Quinlan mentioned, the Man2Man programme is a joint initiative taken by the GHN and the HSE that commenced in December 2011.  It was the first programme of its type of in Ireland specifically targeted at MSM and one of the actions recommended in the Department of Health's National AIDS Strategy Committee's HIV and AIDS education and prevention plan for the period 2008 to 2012.  The key messages of the programme were strongly linked with the findings of key research, particularly the EMIS study referred to.  The programme messages were on promoting HIV prevention, including the promotion of testing and condom use, providing access to free condoms and promoting services such as LGBT telephone helplines.  The programme was promoted primarily through social and online media.  There was specific targeting of the HSE Dublin North East and Dublin Mid-Leinster regions.  The results were quite promising following 12 months of promotion.  They showed an 81% increase in the number of website visitors, a 65% increase in the number of calls to LGBT helplines in the ten counties specifically targeted in the Dublin north east and Dublin mid\u2010Leinster regions, a 1,650% increase in the number of YouTube views on the Man2Man Ireland channel and a 9% increase in the number of attendees at the GMHS-HSE clinic for testing, which included a 25% increase among men living in rural Ireland.<\/p><p>  Given these promising results, the HSE and the GHN agreed on the importance of building on these achievements and the investment to promote consistent and sustained HIV and STI prevention messages among MSM in Ireland.  The recommendations include continuous development of <i>Man2Man.ie<\/i>, the only sexual health information and resource website specifically targeting MSM in Ireland; promoting social inclusion and increasing access to information for harder to reach groups living outside urban areas; establishing peer-led volunteer outreach services; and continuing to respond to emerging needs.  <\/p><p>  While we have worked to secure funding throughout 2013, we have also progressed some of these recommendations, including constantly updating the website.  Our partners in Gay Switchboard have launched a new drop-in sexual health information service and a new e-mail support service.  The new peer and volunteer outreach service has commenced in Dublin and Cork.  The GHN has been actively participating in the gonorrhoea control group co\u2010ordinated by the public health department of HSE East in responding to the increase in the number of gonorrhoea infections among MSM.  In partnership with GMHS, we also published a new research report arising from the EMIS data.   <\/p><p>  Other programmes strongly associated with the Man2Man programme are under development.  The BeLonGTo youth service is developing a personal development course for younger MSM aged 18 to 24 years, while Gay Switchboard Dublin will deliver a course for MSM aged 25 years and over.  GHN is the only network of its kind in Ireland that has a specific focus on HIV prevention for MSM.  It is a partnership of a range of organisations and individuals, including men living with HIV.  Organisations involved in the GHN are primarily those involved in front-line services, including the Gay Switchboard Dublin, the BeLonGTo youth service, Dublin AIDS Alliance, GMHS, Rainbow Support Services at the Red Ribbon Project, Open Heart House, Outhouse LGBT Community Centre and Positive Now.  These are just some of the partners involved.  We all know partnership is a very cost-effective approach.  This is very true for the GHN as there are no salary costs involved.

As policy makers and citizens, we should all be concerned about the increase in the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases.  As a teenager during the 1980s, I become concerned when people speak about advertising campaigns.  While the advertising campaign of the 1980s was effective in terms of the shock and horror impact, it was not very informative and it stigmatised a large number of people in the gay community both in Ireland and internationally.  It is my personal view that it set us back several years in the promotion of equality.  By stigmatising people with HIV, it discouraged people from coming forward to seek assistance.  As health awareness campaigns can work both ways, our ideas for an active campaign should be carefully thought out.<\/p><p>  We all know that there are simple forms of prevention that can be effective, but, in terms of testing, how do we encourage people to be more proactive in being tested on a frequent basis?  What methods can be used to encourage high risk groups to be tested more frequently and what barriers are in place to prevent them from doing so?  There is still a stigma attached to sexually transmitted disease and for personal reasons, people may not want their local GP to know they are sexually active.  Is this a stumbling block in the relationship between individuals and their GPs and can it be addressed by making testing services more readily available?  Screening conjures up images of checking people against their will.  It is critical that they are not discouraged from coming forward.  The process should be user friendly and informative.<\/p><p>  We never discuss the topic of cancer in the context of sexually transmitted diseases.  Why are they not mentioned when we are, for example, discussing oral or cervical cancer?  I presume we should be conscious of these issues when speaking about sexually transmitted diseases.  We must be more proactive in education, but any education or advertising campaign should pay heed to the potential downside in stigmatising certain groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500008#G00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1386238800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their contributions.

Another consequence of being old is that I can remember the story of HIV as a disease right from the beginning.  I recall reading the first reports that came out of New York and Los Angeles about unusual infections among gay men and the occurrence of a very rare cancer called Kaposi sarcoma.  I am also old enough to have, I believe, seen and diagnosed the first two cases of HIV-related illness in Ireland when I was a young doctor working as a non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, in the 1980s.  I subsequently went to New York at a time when the city and the medical community was deeply in the grip of the consequences of HIV infection.  This awful tragedy being visited on people was an illness which was mysterious in its origins and universally fatal in its outcome, and the prospects seemed so incredibly awful.<\/p><p>  People need to reflect for a second.  This is the greatest triumph of modern scientific medicine.  What happened with HIV was unprecedented.  In 1985 or 1987, when we knew we were dealing with a virus, and realising how miserably difficult viruses were to deal with because we cannot treat them with antibiotics, no living person - no rational doctor - would have imagined that within five or six years the life expectancy for this illness would be so dramatically transformed.  It is important that we record this, the greatest modern scientific achievement.<\/p><p>  My questions are for Dr. Holohan.  How many genitourinary medical consultants per head of population do we have in the Republic of Ireland?  What are the figures for the UK?  What is the average figure for most European countries?

It is a first for me to hear people with such great passion and expertise here.  There was much information and many figures, and it takes a while for me to get them into my head.  All the figures are disturbing.  I still find it very difficult to hear that men and women, young and old, straight and gay, do not understand the huge health risk there is around their sexual life.  My immediate worry is about young people in school and college.  We live in a society in which drink has topped every other drug for young people.  There are huge complications with people drinking at even younger ages.<\/p><p>  When my children went to school they went through all the educational steps mentioned earlier about being safe and seen.  The problem lies in school.  I frequently speak to young people in transition year in local schools about their drinking activities.  The proper solution is not to ask the teacher who teaches other subjects in a class to talk to young people about drink, drugs and sex.  Young people do not want to talk to a teacher they might have in an hour's time for maths.  It needs a separate approach, particularly regarding sexually transmitted diseases, of which there has been a major increase.<\/p><p>  I live in an area with the highest population in Ireland of young lone parents and people having sex at a younger age.  This is all scientifically measured.  Unless we come to grips with this in the classroom, whatever chance we have of getting these people into their 30s without having one of these sexually transmitted diseases is diminishing.  I would like to see something done in the classroom, not with the teacher but with somebody who comes in on a regular basis to deal with young people and allow them to ask the questions they might not want to ask Mrs. Brown who teaches them home economics in an hour's time.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked why people have to wait so long to be diagnosed with infections.  It is a crucial time for them and they should not be left waiting.  Are there plans for a national screening programme in this country, as in England?  Dr. Holohan said there were services including STI screening, diagnosing and treatment.  Where are they?  Can we have a list of where they are?  I would like them to be more frequent, particularly for people in schools.  Are there plans through the Department or the HSE for a national campaign, similar to the road traffic campaign, on television or radio to identify with young people?  There are plenty of radio stations out there and young people listen to them every minute of the day.

Why has there been such a spike?  How widely is the trust curriculum being taught and what are the obstacles to facilitating it?

With regard to campaigns, over the past ten years significant resources have been directed towards developing targeted, integrated campaigns directed towards at-risk groups.  In response to Deputy Kelleher's comment that he hoped campaigns had changed, there is considerable science and literature behind how they are conducted nowadays, with resources put into evaluating them right across sexual health campaigns such as Think Contraception and the Man to Man campaign.  We are going back to the target groups to make sure the message is being communicated, is effective and is not wearing down with people becoming tired of it.  It is also ensured that campaigns are linked with a broader integrated strategy in order that where a person is listening to the message, he or she is also hearing the same message at school, at home, in the workplace or wherever, and we are also looking at new means of communication.  Some of the more recent campaigns, including the gonorrhoea campaign that will be launched next week, are based on social media initiatives.  There has been huge improvement and experience within the country, in government, among health services and among partners in how to do this work.  Sexual health is one of the areas in which one can say good work is happening.  The literature is clear about what works and what does not in terms of using fear tactics.  Sometimes they work - with road safety or smoking, for example - but not necessarily with sexual health.  The messaging around those campaigns is about empowering and informing, destigmatising and normalising certain behaviours.<\/p><p>  Our teenage birth rate has decreased from 20 per 1,000 to 12 per 1,000.  We have seen significant successes in terms of consistent condom use among at-risk groups.  My colleagues, who have more experience than I, will discuss testing behaviours, working with GPs and so on.  Over that period, we have seen more campaigns, partnerships, research and services.  When one thinks about where we have come from in this country in the area of sexual health, we would all acknowledge that we are in a different space now compared to ten years ago, not to mind 20 years ago.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about partnerships.  I have worked in the sexual health area for a number of years and partnership is the significant element of how we do this work.  Partnerships can be difficult.  They involve a level of trust.  One must work hard at them but one can see that in the sexual health area, it is a critical piece of the broad integrated approach to addressing these issues and ensuring the messages are consistent.  We are trying to bang the same drum with one message collectively.  There has been much better practice in this area over the past ten years compared to the previous period.<\/p><p>  Investment in research in sexual health has been impressive.  We have much better data and information and we are able to answer the questions posed about, for example, sex education in schools.  It is provided in 86% of schools, according to young people who report, and 90% of them say they have had it in schools.  We have a much better environment to have robust and informative dialogue with the Department of Education and Skills and the out-of-school sector in ensuring the curricula we have developed are implemented in a more sustained way.  I do not suggest that this is without challenges, because there always are challenges.  There is always a new generation of young people coming through at different stages of their lives and it is important for us to have a sustained, strategic approach regarding how we address that.<\/p><p>  Dr. Lyons will take the questions on testing and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500010#J00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1386240000,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Keeffe for staying and for replying to those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500010#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386240000,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I will do my best to go back over the questions and if I inadvertently leave some out, members can let me know.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kelleher's first question was about cancer prevention capacity in regard to STIs.  That was a substantial part of the rationale for the introduction of the HPV campaign and the immunisation provided to girls in their young teenage years.  The uptake in Ireland is at least at or ahead of the rate in most other countries and it will be an important part of the prevention of the cancers the Deputy mentioned.  That will be acknowledged as part of the strategic importance of STIs in the context of the new strategy I referred to earlier.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked questions about prevention and testing, which Dr. Lyons will address.  The questions of HIV testing and screening and targeting of high-risk groups are considered as part of the new strategy.<\/p><p>  Local barriers to GPs and access to knowledge are a continuing issue in access to services, particularly for young people and particularly for sensitive areas around sexual and reproductive health, whether it is access to contraception, STI services or, particularly in rural areas, people's fear of or unwillingness to attend a local GP.  This is a consistent barrier and services then have to try to provide alternatives for people to be able to get around that.  We acknowledge that this is a problem in the delivery of services that can be accessible in local communities.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question about the strategy, it is our intention that we will finalise and present it for the Minister to bring to Government for approval and to publish before the end of the first quarter of 2014.  He asked about Northern Ireland.  As he mentioned, the strategy is chaired by the Department and it involves all the major stakeholders.  We heard from some individuals who are participating in that during statements earlier.  For example, Tiernan Brady is a member of the steering group.  It is supported by the Institute of Public Health, which provides the secretariat and the expertise behind much of it.  It is a North-South body and it has through that mechanism provided a great deal of access for the group to expertise.  When one gets into public awareness of a range of issues that are not confined to sexual health, there is probably significant cross-Border value in working together, if for no other reason than to recognise the fact that we share many media, and if we work collaboratively we can share the cost burden and the expertise available to both.

It is great that we are discussing this matter at this Oireachtas committee meeting.  There were many questions on breaking down the barriers to promote testing.  The past 20 years have taught us that from an individual perspective and a population perspective, the benefits of knowing one's HIV status are beyond all doubt.  Improving availability of and access to testing will take several strands, but normalisation is key.  It must become normal to have a HIV test.  As I have learned in the past 20 years of medical practice, this virus does not discriminate.  It does not care whom it infects.  Unfortunately certain people in our community are more likely to be affected, but it does not care whom it infects.<\/p><p>  We have demonstrated that we can do this.  The antenatal screening programme introduced in 1999 has been a resounding success in reducing the number of vertically infected children.  It has happened and the percentage uptake rates have been in the high 90s.  It was introduced in 1999 following anonymous unlinked testing.  We decided that if it went beyond a certain threshold, there was a benefit at a population level to introduce screening and that we would stop doing anonymous testing when the uptake exceeded 95%.  In every year since its introduction the percentage uptake has been in the high 90s.  We can do this in this country.  So it is about normalisation, and the developing and fostering of partnerships.<\/p><p>  With respect to why we need to do this, some very important data have been published in the press over the weekend about the number of people who were diagnosed having presented at the Mater Hospital emergency department.  It is not just about targeting high-risk groups; given the prevalence in our population, certainly in the greater Dublin area, we may need to consider that everybody, regardless of whether they are in an at-risk group, is at a point where they would benefit from knowing their HIV status.  Some 14 cases were picked up in the Mater where they did not come for a HIV test but had a HIV test, with 11 of them being brand new cases.  That represents a very significant benefit for those individuals as well as at a population level.<\/p><p>  I would like to speak about what the 2012 HIV figures show us.  Everyone has acknowledged we have come a long way but we still have some problems.  Based on the 2012 data, the proportion of people who are presenting late is still too high.  Some 48% of people who presented with HIV at the time of their diagnosis had evidence of significant damage to their immune system at that time.  There is a clear need to get people to access testing.  That needs to be addressed from a service-user perspective and from a service-provider perspective.

There is another set of barriers lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people face, as they want to access services.  The HSE commissioned research carried out by us in GLEN and BeLonG To, called Understanding LGBT Lives.  From that document we have worked with the National Association of General Practitioners and the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland to build those guidelines to try to build capacity at a health-care professional level to understand what those barriers are.

Much research has taken place since then to show such campaigns do not work.<\/p> <p>It is important to point out that during the development of the Gay Health Network campaign the key messages were developed by a younger peer group of men who have sex with men and facilitated by BeLonGTo youth services.  It is also important that people living with HIV be included in developmental programmes.  We recommended that this be done in the national sexual health strategy.<\/p><p> Regarding access to tests, there are many free STI testing public clinics across Ireland, but it is necessary to provide access in isolated and rural areas.  Information is key, as people may not know the risks.  As Mr. Goulding mentioned, stigma is a major barrier, while people fear HIV test results.  This needs to be combated.<\/p><p> It is correct to say the younger generation had not been exposed to information on HIV until we launched the Man2Man campaign in December 2011, the first national campaign in many years.  A sustained HIV prevention message for younger men is required.<\/p><p> On funding for national campaigns, I can speak on behalf of the GHN which has received funding to run a consistent message and build on the successes of the Man2Man programme throughout 2014.  That funding has come from the health promotion and social inclusion units of HSE North East.<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Byrne referred to young people not wanting to speak to teachers about their sexual health.  It can be difficult.  From research, we know that sometimes teachers also find it embarrassing.  There are many ways to break down these barriers, one of which is through training.  It is important that people are trained to deal with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, issues.  Mr. Brady raised this point in the context of training for general practitioners.<\/p><p> The issue of sustainability is important.  BeLonGTo youth services have developed a national support network for young LGBT people across a range of counties.  One can supply funding for one year, but if one does not know what is happening next year, it becomes an issue.  As young people grow up and are replaced by others, long-term sustainability, as opposed to a year-to-year budget, becomes a requirement.<\/p><p> Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about our partnership with the HSE.  It is good.  As Dr. O'Keeffe pointed out, partnerships require a great deal of work.  It is definitely a work in progress.  It is not new to the GHN to partner the HSE.  Gay Men's Health Services of the HSE has been a successful partner for many years.  We are learning from each other and hope our partnership can continue.<\/p><p> Deputy Sandra McLellan asked whether the economic crisis had contributed to HIV and STI transmission rates.  From our work in Dublin AIDS Alliance, it is anecdotally a contributory factor.  We have a programme through which we supply free condoms.  More than 300 people attend every week looking for free condoms because they cannot afford to buy them.  It is important to point out that migrant communities are an at-risk population group for HIV.  Those seeking asylum only receive &euro;19 per week.  That is a major issue, as they have no money for condoms.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about the increase in the number of calls to the Gay Switchboard Dublin helpline.  Gay Switchboard Dublin is a partner of the GHN.  The switchboard is run voluntarily and the service will be 40 years old in 2014.  It has 36 volunteers and receives no statutory funding.  It would welcome such funding in order that it might increase its services to meet rising demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500013#M00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Donlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386241800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to those volunteers for the considerable amount of work they do.

As with trying to get people to engage with health services in general, in encouraging people to be tested we face significant barriers.  The last 20 years have been phenomenal for lesbian and gay people in Ireland.  There has been great change, given the fact that there was decriminalisation only 20 years ago.  Despite the phenomenal change in legislation and society, however, for many people the individual experience is still not one of change.  They face rejection and isolation which they fear.  All of this creates pressure and prevents people from engaging with the services that we need to provide.<\/p><p>  Another key barrier is that no one wants to have a sexual health test.  No one skips to the doctor to have the test done.  It is a question of how to use existing technologies, for example, rapid testing, to make the process convenient, swift, inclusive and non-judgmental.  In London lunch-time clinics allow people to pop in during working hours in order that they do not need to tell anyone that they are taking the day or three hours off to be tested.  In Copenhagen the testing centre is located inside a shop on the main shopping street and one need only pop in.  We must move our testing centres to where people are in order that they can access them in a way that is convenient for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500014#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tiernan Brady"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386241800,"counter":293,"content":"<p>The saying is \"Prevention is better than cure\".

I am pleased to be here today to contribute to these hearings on the general scheme of the public health (standardised packaging of tobacco) Bill 2013.  The Minister has already provided the background to the heads of the Bill.  I will set out some detail regarding the evidence base for the measure and will also go through the general scheme head by head.<\/p><p>  In order to put today's subject matter in context, it is important to state that smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland.  Approximately 5,200 Irish people die every year from diseases caused by smoking - cancers, circulatory diseases, respiratory and digestive diseases.  In all, smoking-related disease causes 19% of all deaths nationally and they are all preventable and avoidable deaths.<\/p><p>  Apart from the cost in terms of disease and years of potential life lost, it is important to consider the economic cost of deaths and illness attributable to smoking.  A European study conducted in 2009 estimated it to be in the region of &euro;664 million for Ireland.  However, it is clear that the measures we have introduced are working.  There has been a decrease in the number of people smoking.  The most recent figures we have from the rolling surveys conducted by the national Office of Tobacco Control indicate that 22% of Irish adults smoke.  That represents a decline of 7% since 2007, when the last large-scale study on smoking in Ireland was done.  In addition, recent data on school-aged children - the HBSC survey, which uses an international methodology - indicates a clear downward trend, with 80% of 15 to 17 year olds not smoking and nearly 90% of 12 to 17 year olds not smoking.<\/p><p>  As the Minister has stated, standardised packaging is the next step in tackling the promotion and advertising of tobacco and smoking.  International research conclusively shows that standardised packaging will increase the noticeability, recall and impact of health warning messages, reduce the ability of packaging to mislead consumers into believing that some products may be less harmful than others, and reduce the attractiveness of the tobacco product for both adults and children.<\/p><p>  What is standardised packaging?  It means that all forms of branding, such as trademarks, logos, colours and graphics, would be removed from tobacco packs.  The brand name would be presented in a uniform typeface for all brands and the pack would be in one plain neutral colour.  The resulting pack will be less attractive to consumers, as the Minister has demonstrated, and will make the picture health warnings stand out more clearly.  It will also prevent packaging from misleading consumers about the harmful effects of tobacco.  For example, evidence shows that lighter-coloured packs give the impression that the cigarettes are less harmful.<\/p><p>  Why do we need to introduce the measure?  Cumulative restrictions in Ireland and internationally on advertising, promotion and sponsorship have resulted in the industry turning increasingly to packaging as a key marketing tool.  It is the last place they can legally advertise their product to interest smokers and potential smokers.  The tobacco industry has argued that standard plain packs would be easier to forge and that smuggling would increase as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500018#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1386243600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I must advise that there is a vote in the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500018#S00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386243600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>The Department is in close contact with the Revenue Commissioners about standardised packaging.

I do not wish to pre-empt the discussion but I am mindful that there may be some issues to be dealt with.  Furthermore, some of the participants in these hearings might identify additional technical issues that may need examination and I look forward to suggestions from the Chairman or committee members which will lead to an improvement in the operation of the legislation.<\/p><p>  Head 1 sets out definitions and interpretations used throughout the Bill.  It defines for us the meanings of some of the terms used for the purposes of the Bill, including \"cigarette pack\", \"combined health warning\", \"retail packaging\", \"tobacco product\" and \"variant name\".  Head 2 deal with regulations.  It makes standard provisions giving the Minister powers to make regulations for the purposes of the Act.  Head 3 sets out the overall purpose of the Bill.  The objective is to reduce the appeal of tobacco products, increase the effectiveness of health warnings and reduce the ability of branded tobacco packaging to mislead consumers about the harmful effects of smoking.  Head 4 sets out the legal jurisdiction and scope of the legislation, in that the provisions in the Act relate to products for retail sale in Ireland only and do not apply to products and packaging for export.<\/p><p>  Head 5 sets out the requirements for the physical features of cigarette packs and cartons.  It provides that cigarette packs and cartons must have a rectangular shape and cigarette packs must have flip-top openings.  The lining of cigarette packs, if any, must only be plain silver-coloured foil with a white paper backing.  Cigarette packs must be a regulated dull drab colour with a matte finish and have plain white inner surfaces.  No trademarks or other marks can appear on tobacco packaging and packs must not be visually enhanced in any way.  Special provision is made for the appearance of the tax stamp and health warnings to be included on packs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500018#S00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386244200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Helath, Dr. Holohan who has been with us all morning and Ms Luddy.  I also welcome the briefing note from the tobacco and alcohol control unit in the Department of Health.  I had sought an elaboration on the evidence for the potential success of the measure.  The jury is still out on this measure, but there is adequate reassurance that this is worth doing, not so much that we will be seen to be doing something but as an end in itself.  I welcome the publication of the heads of the planned legislation.  It does not happen often enough and is a useful and informative initiative.<\/p><p>  With regard to supporting evidence for the effectiveness of the introduction of plain packaging, we are meeting on the first anniversary of the introduction of a similar measure in Australia.  It took place in December last year and I ask the Minister and Dr. Holohan if they have information on any intended report from the Australian Government or the health Hepartment in Australia on what happened in the first 12 months since its introduction and any results to which they can point.  Among other countries considering the measure two are European, Britain and France.  Can the Minister and Dr. Holohan provide us with an update on the point of consideration these two countries are at in this regard?  Are they anywhere near where we are in dealing with proposed legislation?<\/p><p>  Denormalisation, leading I hope to the goal of a significant reduction in tobacco use, if not its elimination, is a shared goal of the members of the committee.  Some can be louder and others, calmer, but I am confident there is a shared rationale across all political views that this is a shared goal.  It is not unique, but it is one on which we can all sign off.  The Minister can take comfort in this.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the recent designation of hospital campuses as smoke-free - it happened in my constituency and was a welcome development - I ask the Chief Medical Officer whether it has been completely ruled out at this time.  Are there hospital sites that have not pursued this development?  Are there health facilities to which it does not apply?  In the experience of those hospital sites that have only recently introduced the measure and where there was a pattern of smoking outside the door as against outside the gates, have there been problems presenting?  Can we get an insight into what the Chief Medical Officer knows at this point about the success of this initiative following its introduction?<\/p><p>  In regard to seized illegal tobacco products, by which I mean those on which tax had not been paid, from time to time we hear about, read and see such reports on television on seizures.  How are the cigarettes seized disposed of?  Perhaps the Chief Medical Officer does not know and perhaps it is the Revenue Commissioners that make the determination.  I wonder whether the disposal of seized tobacco products, not knowing how it is done, could be used as another tool to demonstrate to the public their unacceptable nature.  I hesitate to say incineration is the way to go as it may be in conflict with the very thought of creating a smoke-free environment.  Perhaps the Chief Medical Officer might shed some light on this, but it could be a further aid in demonstrating to young people, in particular, how unacceptable smoking is for them and us, collectively, as a society.<\/p><p>  I welcome the publication of the heads of the Bill and look forward to participating in the engagement with those who will present before us, who are equally committed and of a shared disposition in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500019#T00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1386244200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I express my support for the Minister and welcome the publication of the heads of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500019#T00300","speaker":"1011","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386244800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his colleagues for their strong presentations.

Perhaps there is a really obvious explanation, but if I buy a packet of contraband cigarettes which somebody has seen fit to bring in on Henry Street when this legislation is enacted, it will not be an offence.  Why is the Minister excluding the individual who can continue to go to markets, Moore Street or wherever else?  Why are we not including this as an offence?<\/p><p>  Others spoke about the successes, results and analysis from Australia.  Has any research been conducted on what reformed smokers spend the money they used to spend on tobacco products?  In its campaign the tobacco industry is raising concerns about the disastrous effect this measure will have on the profits of the retail trade and its overall turnover.  I dispute this because I have a very good memory of being the benefactor when my mother gave up smoking when I was a child.  She put the money in a pot and we got to spend it at the end of every month.  I thought I was loaded because she spent most of it on clothes for me.  Has specific research been conducted which we could use to dispel the growing campaign that the money will not be disseminated in the retail industry, as is being stated by the tobacco industry?  Fears are being fuelled by this as a result.<\/p><p>  Again, it is being propagated by the tobacco industry, but there is a slight danger that this will only be seen as a small thing and that the view will be taken that we should be stopping the main suppliers of contraband in this and other countries.

There were rumours of threats from people who were not officially representing the tobacco industry but who appeared to be on the side of those whom we generally thought of as the good guys.

I think the average American citizen who is very anti-smoking would like to know what the agencies acting, allegedly, in his or her name are doing.<\/p><p>  I am very upset that our legislation on smoking in cars in which there are children is still stuck in bureaucracy nearly a year and a half after it was passed on Second Stage.

Any measure that will dissuade people from smoking must be welcomed.  I compliment the Minister for bringing forward the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill.  Earlier in the year on foot of the EU tobacco directive, the Department sought submissions, and I understand in the region of 6,000 submissions were made and the issue of plain packaging was covered.  Would it be beneficial to the consideration of the Bill to have a report on those submissions?<\/p><p>  The Minister alluded to the Australian model and the fact that Australia has introduced plain packaging for cigarettes.  In the region of 82% of the package is covered with warnings, including picture images on health, however, this will only be 65% in Ireland.  Is there a reason we cannot follow through on the Australian example? <\/p><p>  While it may not be totally relevant to the Bill, we are aware of the illegal sale of tobacco.  I have tabled parliamentary questions to the Department of Health that have been referred to the Department of Finance because of the revenue implications.  The sale of tobacco is subject to controls, and the product cannot be sold to minors.  For people who have the habit, we are not losing revenue to the Exchequer.  It does not make sense to impose restrictions on the legal trade, whereas at the same time the illegal trade seems to get away scot free.

What shocked me in the report was the fact that the incidence of cancer related to smoking has overtaken the incidence of breast cancer.  That popped off the page.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the Tobacco Free Ireland report, smoking during pregnancy is not mentioned in this report.  I have raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, in the D&aacute;il in the past couple of weeks, particularly around how we assist women to give up smoking, because of the effect on the unborn child.  I made a suggestion that women should be given nicotine patches under the supervision of their GP to help them give up smoking.  I have spoken to a number of GPs in England and Ireland on giving patches under medical supervision to pregnant women.  I appreciate that the patches are free in England, but I think we should look at this because anything that can help a woman to give up smoking while pregnant is of great value.  Will the Minister elaborate on that point? <\/p><p>  I wish to raise the NRT, nicotine replacement therapy, for medical cardholders.

I think he mentions that the jury is still out on this issue but I would dispute that with him.  There is a whole host of reports from the past two years, in the order of 37 different studies and reports.  An analysis done by Moodie <i>et al<\/i> in 2012 suggests that standardised packaging can reduce the appeal of tobacco products, increase the effectiveness of health warnings and reduce the ability of branded tobacco packaging to mislead customers about the harmful effects of smoking.  That is very much the case in terms of having a plain package, as the one I have described here, that does not confuse.  There is one message, namely, &quot;This is not good for you&quot;.  That is the truth.  The more messaging one has on a tobacco package, the less likely one is to get the core message across.<\/p><p>  It is more effective to have plain colouring and one simple message, delivered both in writing and with a graphic picture and the 37 studies support this.  The 2012 review conducted by Moodie across these studies states that it is worth emphasising the remarkable consistency in study findings regarding the potential impact of plain packaging.  Across studies using different designs conducted in a range of countries and with smokers and non-smokers, the key findings are similar.  This consistency of evidence can provide confidence about the observed potential effects of plain packaging.  If and when introduced, existing evidence suggests that plain packaging represents an additional tobacco control measure that has the potential to contribute to reductions in the harm caused by tobacco smoking now and into the future.  That is why I said in my opening remarks that this is about protecting children and future generations from ever taking this product.  I will be astonished if the tobacco industry does not fight us tooth and nail on this because they know, as they do more research than anybody, that it will work as well.  They have billions of euro at their disposal.  They are terrified of it.  They will leave no stone unturned or no group unsolicited for support to try to block this.<\/p><p>  I will go through the contributions seriatim as I might miss something that somebody has said.  There is a report out today from KPMG sponsored by the tobacco industry showing there has been no reduction.  I would like to get the details of how that was carried out.  This is the industry that knew in 1959 it was selling a carcinogen but never told anyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500022#Y00400","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386246300,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I must inform Senator Colm Burke that there is a vote in the Seanad.

I will come back to the other questions in due course if that is okay.<\/p><p>  The argument about damage to Ireland's intellectual property reputation is another spurious one.  This country has very strong property laws.  They are attacking us on intellectual property rights because they know this country has a Constitution that provides very strong protections to property rights.  We have taken our legal advice.  I would be aware that the tobacco industry has retained a large number of senior counsel.  They might not use them, but the fact that the tobacco industry has retained them means we cannot use them.  We saw that coming.  We took action before that became the case.  We have a good team to defend any challenge to this legislation.  Part of that team is in this room.

This is a very serious public health measure on which we will not be deterred by anybody.  Irish people have a right to self-determination and the role of Members is to represent them.  The vast bulk of Irish people support our position on this matter.  This affords me an opportunity to consult my iPad to cite the findings of a survey conducted by Ipsos MRBI on behalf of the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation, the Irish Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Children, Barnardos, the Children's Rights Alliance, the Asthma Society of Ireland, the Irish Heart Foundation, the Irish Cancer Society,  ASH Ireland and the Irish Thoracic Society.  A news release on the survey findings states:<blockquote><br \/>The new law is being introduced to protect children&rsquo;s health by inserting large graphic warnings of the fatal consequences of smoking on cigarette packs and making it illegal for tobacco companies to use colour, text and packet size to market cigarettes.  The study shows that whilst the plain packs have the backing of 74% of non-smokers, a majority of smokers are also in favour, with 58% supporting the Government legislation which is due to come into force next year. <\/blockquote>The Chairman will be pleased to note that the highest regional support for the plan was in Munster and Leinster, outside Dublin, where support stood at 74%.  Men, at 73%, were also more supportive of the legislation than women, at 69%.  People are with us on this issue because they are wise and know the harm done by cigarettes.  They have experienced scenes similar to those I described from experience, not only throughout my professional life but also in my personal life.  They know the harm this product causes and want their children to be protected.  I fully accept that the legislation may not cause everyone who is so addicted to cigarette smoking to give up cigarettes.  However, a survey conducted in Canada after graphic warnings were introduced found a fourfold increase in the number of smokers expressing a desire to quit.  <br \/><font color=\"#0000FF\">  <\/font>Senator Crown referred to the Bill on smoking in cars.  While I and my Department fully support the legislation, we are trying to get through a significant number of Bills.  I must give priority to this legislation because it is of critical importance.  As licensing is part of the budgetary consideration, it must be implemented.  There is no slouching on this matter and nobody is holding back on the Bill on smoking in cars.  The Attorney General is working through a number of technical difficulties in the legislation.  I may seek additional support for the tobacco unit in terms of drafting capability because we have a great deal of work on our plate. <\/p><p>  Deputy Troy referred to 6,000 submissions received by the Department.  The chief medical officer will address this issue.  As far as I am aware, it was the European Union, rather than my Department, which sought submissions.  It is appropriate that the Deputy raises the issue because it is another ploy used by the tobacco industry as it seeks to have as many people as possible make as many submissions as possible in order to deluge the Department and slow down the process.  Every year produces countless billions of euro in profit for the industry and another 700,000 deaths in Europe from tobacco related illness.  The tobacco industry knows that if Ireland succeeds, which we will, England, Scotland, France and the rest of the Europe will not be far behind.  This is what scares it and the United States is not ignoring what we are doing either.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Troy also noted that the 82% of the surface area of cigarette packs is covered in Australia compared to 65% here.  I have already discussed in detail our view that this Bill must stand and should not be allowed to fall on technicalities.  For this reason, we are keeping the surface area to be covered within the range agreed in the European directive.  As such, we cannot be challenged on that front.  Australia is an independent island and law unto itself, although Australians would probably prefer to have their country described as a large continent.  In any event, it is a large continent surrounded by water.  The bottom line is that it has sole jurisdiction in this matter and does not have to be joined in EU law. <\/p><p>  I have addressed the issue of the illegal trade in tobacco which the Deputy also raised.  This is a matter for the Revenue and Department of Justice and Equality to pursue.  However, if cigarette packets are uniform and one colour, it will be easy to spot packets that are different from the norm and people will be asked how they got them.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne referred to the cost of providing nicotine replacement therapy for pregnant women.  As a doctor, I would like it to be made available to pregnant women.  We have an excellent antenatal care scheme which brings women into regular contact with health professionals during the course of a pregnancy.  It would be a great way to start a campaign of getting off and staying off cigarettes.  If women can stop smoking during their pregnancy, the chances that they will stay off them after the baby is born are very high.  Pregnancy is a time when many women stop smoking.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500024#AA00500","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1386246900,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.  While I cannot provide costings for measures, I am sure the Department could do so and I am certain the cost of providing nicotine replacement therapy to pregnant women who smoke would be far outweighed by the subsequent costs of providing medical treatment for babies and mothers.  Are figures available for the number of people who avail of nicotine replacement therapy under the medical card scheme?<\/p><p>  On the issue of contraband being brought in through airports and ports, I hear a great deal about tobacco being brought in from the North.  There are many minor roads in the Border region.  Is anything being done to prevent illegal trafficking of tobacco from the North?  It is easy to smuggle tobacco that has been brought into Northern Ireland into the Republic.  I know from people who work in Dublin Airport that there is a crackdown on the smuggling of cigarettes at the airport and its security system has become much more advanced recently.  I do not believe there is correlation between higher tobacco prices and the number of contraband cigarettes.  The higher the price, the larger the number of smokers who quit.<\/p><p>  The Minister is correct about people who give up smoking putting savings aside in a jar.  I know people who have been able to take two holidays in one year paid for from the savings they made from giving up smoking.  They were blown away by this because they did not realise they smoked so much or spent so much on the habit. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013120500024#AA00600","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386246900,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I have a couple of additional comments to make.

We want to connect with these people who still have a strong connection with Mayo but we need to invite them to come home.  The Gathering, obviously, played a large part in that.  Accordingly, Mayo County Council established <i>mayo.ie<\/i> two years ago as a channel to communicate to our people around the globe.  This website is an online comprehensive forum that covers news, events, information, business and tourism in Mayo and its 25 parishes.  It is focused on what is happening in the county, so we can tell our people around the world what is happening in their local parishes.  It also allows us to connect with our worldwide Mayo audience.  We focus on business stories in the county so that people know it is a growing economy in the west.  We also promote Mayo as a destination.  The website also contains blogs, galleries, information on arts and crafts producers, as well as local artisanal food producers.<\/p><p>  Over the past several months, we have developed a key strategic relationship with the National Geographic Society and its international genographic project which traces people&rsquo;s DNA to extend it to the Mayo diaspora.  I was one of the guinea pigs in this project and my DNA was traced back 70,000 years.  I am about 2.3% Neanderthal which is slightly higher than the average.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500005#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Joanne Grehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1386247200,"counter":400,"content":"<p>A good bit less than the average politician though.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500005#F00300","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386247200,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Less than the average county manager too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500005#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hynes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386247200,"counter":402,"content":"<p>The majority of the website&rsquo;s traffic is from North America, Canada, UK and Ireland.

He successfully established the IDA in 1949 on a road less travelled as it was not the usual thing to do at the time.  In February 1951 he sent a memorandum to Government on the tourist industry which recommended a Department of tourism focused on policy, with the notion - heretical to the Department of Finance - of multi-annual funding; a single national tourism organisation; and independent local tourism bodies with responsibility for local tourism development and promotion.  The mother and child scheme caused the Government to fall and Se&aacute;n Lemass was the incoming Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He did not agree with Daniel Morrissey and appointed an old civil war friend of his to F&oacute;gra F&aacute;ilte, so we then had two tourism promotion and development bodies.  Later in the 1960s, Bord F&aacute;ilte established regional bodies as opposed to local bodies.  These were established as subsidiaries and were gradually amalgamated into the centre, the last being Dublin Tourism approximately three years ago.<\/p><p>  Ireland has two tourism promotion and development agencies, which is unique and against best practice in developed countries.  Ireland has no structure of independent local tourism organisations, which is also against best international practice.  By following Morrissey's vision and taking a road less travelled at the time, Ireland now enjoys one of the best industrial promotion agencies in the world.  By not following Morrissey's advice we are faced with one of the worst performing tourism promotion agencies in the world.  The documentation distributed to committee members has most of the headlines.  Tourism peaked in 2007 and fell by 30%.  In pure tourism numbers this was a decrease from 4 million in 2007 to 2.8 million, with a recovery this year with The Gathering to approximately 3 million.  The numbers are still down approximately one quarter.  Meanwhile international tourism has risen by approximately 20% so our market share has continued to fall heavily.<\/p><p>  Promotion by Tourism Ireland is costly and, in my opinion, ineffective.  A large World Tourism Organization study took place in 2009 which examined tourism spend by Government per arriving tourist.  Ireland was the highest in Europe with 16 times the spend of Italy, eight times that of France and more than four times that of Britain.  We recommend Tourism Ireland's budget for advertising promotion should be cut by up to &euro;15 million and its promotional expenditure should be concentrated on social media, about which the previous speaker spoke so eloquently.<\/p><p>  One reason Ireland's tourism promotion is expensive is whatever about the efficacy of tourism promotion spending, we do not get return tourists at the same rate.  Our return tourism rate of 35% of visitors is one of the lowest in Europe.  I have heard some people in the tourism industry state return figures are high in sunny countries such as Italy or France at 82%, but it is 83% in the Lake District where people go for rain and walking.  There is no reason it should be as low as 35% here.  It is 66% in Scotland.  If we had the same level we would have twice as many tourists for the same amount of expenditure.  We must examine this.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's 2011 annual report states 99% of overseas holidaymakers' expectations were met or exceeded in 2011.  To make the claim 99% of anything is reached is too much, but it certainly is not the case in terms of people returning to Ireland that they are satisfied with their tourism experience.  There is something gravely wrong.<\/p><p>  In Ireland attractions and local tourism offices are staffed by full-time employees but in Scotland 43% of staff at attractions are volunteers and a further 33% are part time.  Less than one quarter are full-time employees.  This means a very low cost base for opening tourist attractions in rural counties in Scotland which are similar to Mayo here.  When it was examined three years ago, Scotland had 298 attractions with 10,000 or more visitors, whereas Ireland had half that number at 148.  There is an absolute necessity to involve local action in promoting tourism to improve the tourist experience and reduce the costs of providing it.<\/p><p>  We also examined other benchmark tourist areas such as Amsterdam, which has 7 million tourists a year.  The average employee cost in Amsterdam tourism in 2009 was &euro;35,000.  In F&aacute;ilte Ireland it was &euro;65,000, which is twice the industrial wage.  The 2011 annual report stated the salary of the CEO of F&aacute;ilte Ireland was &euro;168,379 but an equal amount was paid in pension to the CEO to allow him retire at the age of 55.  I am not sure how this increased tourism numbers or tourism revenue.<\/p><p>  Our recommendations for tourism are based partly on Morrissey's vision but mainly on best practice elsewhere.  We call for a single national tourism organisation for tourism promotion and development.  Tourism Ireland's advertising budget should be cut by up to &euro;15 million and F&aacute;ilte Ireland should be abolished as unfit for purpose.  Local tourism organisations should be encouraged and part funded to establish local tourism promotion and development.  Perhaps we can discuss this later.  When we examined Dublin two and a half years ago, sovereign poverty meant the only way we could introduce new products was to take public buildings in use, such as Dublin Castle, and turn them to tourist use.  The problem with this is Dublin Castle is occupied by the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which are big beasts that have been there since the 12th century and will not willingly move because a Minister wants them to do so.  We have a special request to the committee to examine and perhaps recommend our proposal in this regard to co-ordinate the implementation of tourism policy.  We suggest a tourism development group to help this implementation process which would be chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.  This would be similar to the Clearing House Group for the IFSC which was established successfully eight or nine years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500007#H00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerome Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1386248400,"counter":407,"content":"<p>We have heard three very provocative and articulate presentations and I thank all the witnesses.

Westport, the Great Western Greenway and The Gathering are three successful examples from which we could learn, and these have been about collaboration, not competition.  Westport started that with collaboration between competing hotels in one town.  I know that the same happens in Kinsale and in other places as well, but collaboration is not the norm and we believe it is very important.<\/p><p>  Another important element is ownership of the projects by people at a very local level.  One of the successes of the Greenway is that it is owned by the landowners and the communities along the route, and is no longer a local authority project.  That has its own challenges and problems, but it works a lot better than if we were going in trying to do something with it.  I think the same is true of The Gathering, and I think this will energise things like the wild Atlantic way, because it provides a framework and that is something that the national authorities and local authorities can do.  However, it is down to local service providers and communities to latch on to that framework, and if we give them the opportunity, they most definitely will do so.<\/p><p>  A study group has just finished its work on the airport.  The future of the airport is mainly going to be about growing numbers to 1.2 million or 1.3 million over the next ten years, in order to bring visitors directly into the region.  With those numbers, the airport would be self sustaining and pay its own way.  We think that is definitely achievable with more regional buy-in and collaboration from the trade and from the local authorities in the region.<\/p><p>  We took an initiative with <i>mayo.ie<\/i> not just to market or advertise Mayo, but to develop real community connections.  We have identified champions in all our communities around the globe and they are the people who drive it, in the same way as the people who live on the Greenway drive that.  Ms Grehan has the figures on it, but it has been very successful.  Finally, the face to face and the handshake are always important and I do not think we do enough of those.  One of the things on which we need to fight back is the media campaign against people travelling for St. Patrick's Day and other occasions to meet with the diaspora.  If any other country in the globe had the kind of access and power that we have on one day of the year, they would have the whole country decanted and out doing business and networking.  While it will not be popular in certain sections of the media, it is hugely important that we start to reverse the view on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500008#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hynes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386249000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>There were 303 gatherings in Mayo this year.  We are in a very powerful position now with our communities to continue that momentum and build traction out of it.  We had a business gathering with Cleveland and Cuyahoga County in Ohio.  That town has 1.2 million people, of whom over 250,000 are from Mayo and specifically from Achill Island.  That is the power of the connection of those people and their place and our place, which is Achill Island.  On the back of that very successful tourism business gathering, a number of enterprise related pipeline leads have been generated.  This is very similar to the Greenway, which provided a platform for local people to establish and grow a business and develop their own brand.  If we continue these relationships and develop a mix of the online and the personal, we have an opportunity to drive that forward and see greater numbers and opportunities and benefits coming through.<\/p><p>  Our unit in <i>mayo.ie<\/i> is just a year young at the moment, but we need to showcase our product wealth.  We gave the committee a little flavour of that, but we need to push it out there.  It is not just about the product; it is also about the experience.  We are trying to think of innovative ways that we can do that.  The cost of the website for the last two years was a benefit-in-kind cost from the local authority staff, whose IT staff designed it inhouse.  We put about &euro;5,000 into developing the brand and we would like to see that upgraded now that it has developed traction.  This year, for the first time, we will see directly into that website and the social media and time challenges, which our Leitrim speaker raised, come to about &euro;50,000.  If we do not invest now when we have the numbers engaged, we are going to lose that traction.<\/p><p>  The airport plays a central role because it connects us to so many people.  The airport has relationships with airlines and operators that the communities on the ground do not.  The western regional tourism marketing programme was a collaboration between five local authorities - Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Mayo - the Western Development Commission, and I co-ordinated it at the time, and Ireland West Airport in Knock.  The counties put in &euro;30,000 each and the WDC put in &euro;50,000.  The airport matched that total of &euro;200,000 and F&aacute;ilte Ireland matched it on a 3:2 ratio with &euro;600,000, which led to a total of &euro;1 million.  Tourism Ireland then leveraged its connections with airlines and tour operators internationally in designated locations that would come into the country, which cost &euro;1.4 million.  The power of all that netted the value.  If we were planning that again, we would plan it much further in advance and start it much earlier, so that more people would come directly into our area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Joanne Grehan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386249600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>We run Pure Life Pure Irish, a Facebook page on which we post photographs, Irish poems, jokes and culture, covering Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal, Fermanagh and parts of Mayo.

The answer is no.  What happens when one has a high cost base, as we have in tourism, is that all one can do is market-skimming.  One cannot put on the market low-cost products, as one could do if the cost base were lower, by using volunteers.  Let me give an example.  Last year the Dublin tourism authority decided it would have to close the Joyce Tower in Sandycove.  The funds from entry charges were not sufficient to pay the salary of the curator and the iconic tower was closed.  I wrote to the then manager of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Mr. Eoin Keegan, suggesting that if the tower was in Scotland, one would have an army of Joyce readers who would be helping out on a voluntary basis.  He took this on board and organised a meeting.  At present the Joyce Tower is being curated by an army of volunteers.  The opening hours are longer and it is more convenient for people.  There is still a professional input from the tourism body, but it is not a direct cost input from the tourism body.  Coming back to my earlier point, there are twice as many small tourist attractions in Scotland as we have in Ireland.  That is exactly what happens there.<\/p><p>  More generally, I acknowledge that The Gathering was very successful.  Unless it remains like a pop-up restaurant, we must put in place some funding and establish local tourist organisations that can respond to local need and opportunity.  Normally, the way that is done in other countries is through local tourism organisations.  In most cases, they probably cover the same area as the local county, although in areas with low numbers of tourists a couple of counties might come together.  It would be a company limited by guarantee - that is the normal legal structure - so although there would be organisations such as Mr. O'Hara's and members would be paying a  professional membership fee of &euro;100 a year or a figure of that order, that would be the limit of their liability if anything went wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500009#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerome Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1386249600,"counter":417,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Casey referring to targeted funding specific to areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500009#K00700","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386249600,"counter":418,"content":"<p>Yes, absolutely.

We must get a stronger footing under the kinds of initiative we have heard about in County Mayo so that there can be continuity.  Fifteen years ago Scotland wanted to join the arc of prosperity consisting of Norway, Iceland and Ireland.  They thought the Celtic tiger was great, although it suddenly crashed, but they took the Bord F&aacute;ilte idea - that of a strong and aggressive central development organisation - and introduced it to Scotland.  It worked very badly.  They unravelled it and returned to the 400 local development and tourism organisations, and that is working very well.  In some places, such as the Hebrides, they depend entirely on visitors, but at least the facility is open because there is community commitment.

The enterprise and investment unit is not that common and we think it is unique as currently constituted.  To my knowledge, other local authorities are doing similar things in slightly different ways.  The common denominator among the local authorities, which forms part of Government policy and is strongly supported by us, is the notion that a whole lot more Government services should be co-ordinated through the democratically constituted local government agency and rolled out by it  rather than delivered directly from the centre.  That is a shared theme and is where the thinking on the enterprise and investment unit came from.<\/p><p>  The unit comprises a number of pillars.  There is the tourism and diaspora element, which we have talked to the committee about; marine and renewable energy, which is why the point about the marine resource was included in what was ostensibly a tourism presentation; inward investment, which my colleague Ms Grehan will speak about; and microenterprise support, which is also part of Ms Grehan's brief in her official day job as CEO of the Mayo County Enterprise Board.  We will move into that space as LEOs are rolled out nationwide.  Ms Grehan will also deal with the question of key performance indicators.<\/p><p>  With regard to the question on stand-alone companies, we had one called Mayo Naturally in the 1990s.  Among its successes was the Mayo 5000 celebration concert in 1993, which led directly to the performance of Riverdance as the interval act at the Millstreet Eurovision Song Contest, because that was the first time its dancers and musicians came together.  Sometimes there are unforeseen consequences.  At present we are examining the future of the limited guarantee company.  We will either stand it down and put the work back into the enterprise and investment unit or use it as a vehicle for the present enterprise and investment unit.  The jury is out as we speak.  <\/p><p>  The most difficult question was on pylons, wind turbines and fracking.  The council has tried to get a little ahead of the posse by developing a renewable energy strategy.  It categorises areas of the county where turbines are welcome or not welcome and identifies difficult areas, and a consensus has been reached.  I accept that the consensus will last until it is tested, when applications are received.  The first two applications are going through the works as we speak and the consensus seems to be holding.  Some areas have made it very clear that they do not want turbines.  Pylons are a little more difficult because they provide power, which must be provided.  The advice we have at present is that the project cannot be undergrounded.  We understand that information to be correct.  As a consequence we must choose either industry and jobs or preservation of the environment and emigration.  The answer to the question requires a very large democratic decision which is way above my pay grade.  It is a contentious and sensitive issue.<\/p><p>  The county council is no expert on fracking but we know that fracking when properly managed, which is the consensus of the UK study, it will not and should not cause environmental damage.  Unless a concerted opposition campaign to fracking takes place then fracking should not detract from the tourism product in perception terms.  There is a danger that a backlash and opposition, regardless of the environmental impact, will damage and tarnish the image of the country.  I am worried about the issue as we move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500010#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hynes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386250200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I will start by referring to Matt Molloy's pub also.  Depending on when members were in the bar, I was one of the dancers at the back shuffling away.<\/p><p>  The enterprise and investment unit has a broad and interesting brief.  The county manager has assigned an ambitious and enthusiastic team to the unit.  We have been very fortunate and a lot of hard work has been done over the year.  The only measurement that we have been asked for is jobs, by which I mean the retention of jobs, support for jobs and jobs growth.  To that end, we have networked ourselves in many different places and as far and near as we can.  We have set up think tanks in different locations to challenge us to think better.  The think tanks comprise members of the diaspora who have done extremely well in their chosen careers, and we have one in Dublin.  <\/p><p>  This year we have sustained jobs and the county enterprise board has done a lot of work.  Our greatest success this year has been last week's announcement by Northgate Information Solutions from the UK that it intends to create 150 jobs in Mayo over the next three years, including 50 jobs in the new year and 100 to be rolled out as soon as we can deliver them and in partnership with the group thereafter.  That was a great coup for the county, its people, the unit and the people who supported us.  We are very excited about the news.  The group will return to us next week to choose a location in the county.<\/p><p>   Jobs are a key performance indicator.  The delivery of new initiatives is rated against job creation in the short, medium and long term.  That is why we see tourism as being so critical and central to what we do.  We view tourism as enabling us to create jobs in the short term.<\/p><p>  I shall outline the extent to which we are out and about in communities.  We are a team of 12 people, including two interns supplied through the JobBridge programme.  Therefore, we cannot be everywhere all the time.  As the county manager has said, there are a number of pillars.  Like everybody else, we would like lots of resources.<\/p><p>  Communication is very high on our agenda.  We communicate with all of our networks and communities and with the media.  We have tried to ensure they hear us when we talk about the good things that happen in the county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500010#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Joanne Grehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386250800,"counter":429,"content":"<p>As we are under time pressures, I ask delegates to keep their responses brief, as I want to allow members in also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500011#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386250800,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I have two points to make.  It is great to see leadership being given in County Mayo.  Funding is a big problem in County Leitrim.  In fairness to Leitrim Development Board, Leitrim County Council and Leitrim Tourism, they are doing their best and it is great to be able to talk to them, but they have no money available.  That is a major problem.  That County Leitrim has one of the highest emigration rates is unreal.  In two villages in north Leitrim almost 300 young people have left, a few of whom were very interested in the tourism business.  One guy had developed a stand-up paddle, SUP, board.  He started two years ago and was doing very well.  However, he could not obtain funding.  The project could have grown much faster but was held back because of the lack of funding.<\/p><p>   On funding for marketing, there are many mature people who have developed their own ideas but who need funding to get to the market.  Such funding is not in place for 2014.  Irrespective of what is made available in 2015, no funding will be available in 2014. <\/p><p>  We will not have a bigger showcase than Milan Expo 2015.  In the past couple of weeks Dubai has won the right to host Expo 2020.  My idea was to relaunch The Gathering in 2020 and showcase the event in Dubai, which is one of our largest markets.  The Middle East market is massive.  We need to have someone on the ground there probably more than in any other place to develop that market.<\/p><p>  Fracking is a major issue in County Louth.  I cannot agree with Mayo County Council on this issue because fracking has to be stopped.  From living in and talking to people in the United States, there are areas in Pennsylvania that have been desecrated.  If we are to bring American tourists here and they drive past large fracking sites, they will say they can see this back home as well as the mess created.  Fracking is a massive issue for tourism.  There may be a spin-off initially, but afterwards when plants are up and running, there will be very little benefit.  Many plants have closed in Pennsylvania because the price of gas has never been as low in the markets.  It is a major issue which should be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500011#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John James O'Hara"},{"type":"speech","time":1386250800,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Casey to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500011#M00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386250800,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I will convey Deputy Michael Colreavy's kind regards to Mr. Felim O'Rourke who is Bahrain and will not be back until next summer.<\/p><p>  On the question of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, local tourism initiatives are undertaken independently.  That is the way it is done in every other country we have studied.  It does not mean, however, that Mayo County Council will take a major decision to invest &euro;10 million in the Wild Atlantic Way or a section of it.  I worked in Cement Roadstone, each subsidiary company of which had a limit for its managing director.  The managing director of Cement Roadstone had a limit of &euro;100,000 for excavating shovels.  He submitted a purchase order for a shovel at a cost of &euro;100,000.  A young girl in the office who was new to the job said there must have been a mistake and refused the request.  He was hot-headed and asked where his \"blink blink\" shovel was?  It was a Ruston Bucyrus shovel which cost &euro;100,000.  Somebody else had a limit of &euro;50,000.<\/p><p>  As one cannot make decisions on small but worthy investment projects in County Leitrim - &euro;3,000 for one or &euro;4,000 for another - because it is totally counterproductive to gather the amount of information needed to be sent to Dublin, it has to be done locally.  If it is done locally, it will help to extend the tourism product, not market skim, as happens in the case of decision-making in Dublin.   Having said that, limits will be set for individual investment decisions and a budget allocated based on population and the level of dependence on tourism and so on.  It is not rocket science; as it is done elsewhere, let us try it.  The centralised autocratic system in place is not delivering the goods.<\/p><p>  How much comes back from a &euro;1 million tourism investment?  There are some large figures put forward for the numbers dependent on tourism - a figure of 180,000 has been put forward.  That is the figure for tourism and all other amenities such as eating, drinking and sleeping.  As the tourism input is fairly small, the number dependent on tourism is not 180,000.  Unfortunately, some of the tourism representatives, as well as the Minister in a radio interview ten days ago, drop all of the qualifications and just the use word \"tourism\".  A figure of more than 190,000 was mentioned, but it is nothing like it, rather the figure is between 40,000 and 50,000.  It is half the number of full-time farmers and almost double the number employed in the IFSC, but it is still not 180,000 or 190,000.<\/p><p>  Can the provision of pylons and wind turbines and fracking damage tourism?  I cannot say anything about fracking as I do not know anything about it.  Mr. O'Hara has made a contribution on the matter.  I cannot comment on turbines because I own a small 6 kW wind turbine.  If we had time, I would tell the committee about the cost of being at the cutting edge of technology and there supposedly being a Swedish bearing.  Instead there was a knock-off copy.<\/p> <p>The guy involved went bust.<\/p><p> I remember looking at the proposed pylon route from Northern Ireland.  If the cables are not put overground, it will add 3% to electricity prices nationally.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Mayo county manager; there is no choice in this matter.  It is unfortunate that we do not have more people living in villages instead of being dispersed in one-off housing in country areas that may have to accommodate structures such as pylons in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500011#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerome Casey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386251400,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I welcome our visitors and appreciate their contributions.<\/p><p>  Let me begin with the delegation from County Mayo.  I visited the county in August with my family and had the pleasure of travelling on the Greenway from Westport to Achill.  It was a fantastic experience, so much so that I found myself writing a blog for my website in the bar of the hotel at the bridge to Achill.  It is still available to read if anyone present wants to read it.  I commend Mayo County Council for being ahead of the posse in developing the Greenway.<\/p><p>  Our old and abandoned railway lines are national assets and comprise resources that we need to try to develop.  In County Kerry, where I am from, we are trying to consider uses for the old mountain stage railway line from Farranfore to Valentia Island, focusing initially on the part running from Glenbeigh to Cahersiveen.  We are also examining the Tralee-Fenit line and the Kilmorna-Listowel line so as to join up with the Great Southern Trail.<\/p><p>  The country has potential to have a fully integrated greenway system.  Perhaps this might take from the Mayo line because it led the way.  My family travelled specifically to Westport to travel on the Mayo Greenway.  Would it not be fantastic, however, if one could come to Ireland and spend one's entire holiday cycling on greenways?  We do not necessarily need to use old, abandoned railway lines as there may be space beside some of the newer roads, provided the cycling trails could be separated from them.  We have a vast network of rarely used smaller backroads that could be used for safe cycling.  This could be achieved with a little work and planning.  There are other resources available such as old, abandoned roads that could be used.  Stretches of the old road between Tralee and Killarney are idle.  Why not use them?  I am sure there are such roads all over the country.  This is something to consider for the future.  However, we need to embrace the concept and planning now.  Cycling tourism and slow tourism have a big future in this country.<\/p><p>  The same applies to walking.  I am from a rural, agricultural area and believe we really need to grasp the nettle and come to terms with the land access issue to make it easier for everyone to gain access to the countryside.  At the same time, there should be a buy-in among the people who own the land.  In the case of the proposed south Kerry greenway, ownership of the lands in question was assumed by the adjoining landowners when the line closed in the early 1960s.  This is similar to what occurred in the 1930s when the Great Western Railway closed.  A problem is that while a farmer might recognise the great benefits to his or her area of a greenway passing through his or her land, he or she will lose out on his or her single farm payment in respect of the corridor of land he or she allows to be used for it.  That is not right.  Someone should not lose out financially in facilitating an important asset in his or her area.  There needs to be a multidepartmental approach to ensure everyone can be treated fairly.  I commend Mayo County Council for its initiative and vision with regard to the Greenway.<\/p><p>  Leitrim is a beautiful county that I have had the pleasure to visit.  Do the delegates from there believe there is a regional problem in that so many visitors come to Dublin and not to the west?  Last Thursday night I met in Dublin two American tourists who did not plan to travel beyond Dublin, although their dream had always been to see the fields and rustic areas.  Their problem was that, for them, it was a bit too much hassle to try to get out of Dublin.  That may be the perception and perhaps we need to work harder on marketing to demonstrate it is not very difficult to get from Dublin to the west or south west.  The rail network has improved immensely in recent years.  The motorway network is far better than it was even five years ago.  Perhaps visitors to the country are not fully aware of this.  There may be a perception based on the substandard roads of the past.  In some places, they still are substandard.  Perhaps the delegates might share their views on this issue.<\/p><p>  I have put much thought during the years into winter tourism.  Scotland serves as a good example when comparing our tourism product and marketing efforts with those of other countries.  Scotland has been working on its winter tourism potential.  How could we push this more?  Ireland is as spectacular in the winter as it is in the summer.  It has much to offer, including smaller attractions such as the quieter pubs with their turf fires at night time.  How could we promote this further?<\/p><p>  The retention of the 9% VAT rate has been welcomed universally in the tourism sector, as has the scrapping of the travel tax.  Will Mr. Casey state how we fare internationally in terms of value for money?  We have been doing our best in coming up with and retaining initiatives.  However, have we further to go?  My understanding is that we have improved immensely in recent years in terms of our international rank.  Is there something more we could be doing?<\/p><p>  The cruise sector has potential.  Ireland is an island nation and we could easily have seven-day cruises around the country, albeit with some logistical planning and infrastructural development.  Do the delegates recognise potential in this area?<\/p><p>  The Gathering was a great success, as seems to be accepted.  Last week I noted that there were 5.5 million trips abroad by Irish people in the first ten months of the year.  Do the delegates recognise the merit in promoting a year that might be called &ldquo;The Staying&rdquo;, whereby a massive effort would be made to keep Irish people in the country for one year?  Obviously, not all of the 5.5 million trips abroad in the first ten months of the year were for recreation but since many were, would it be worthwhile promoting an initiative aimed at getting people to stay at home to a greater extent than has been promoted in recent years?  I am sure the marketing people could come up with a term much better than &ldquo;The Staying&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  The return rate of one in three is quite poor.  What is the reason for it?  Will Mr. Casey state whether there is dissatisfaction that we do not recognise?  Is it a logistical issue?  Is Ireland just seen as a once-in-a-lifetime destination?  How could this issue be tackled?  There is great potential in this area.  How do we arrive at figures such as those for Scotland and the Lake District?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500012#N00200","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1386251400,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates who have certainly been very informative.

They made interesting presentations which were different in many ways, even though from the same region.<\/p><p>  They might comment on an opinion I hold that we all think we are the centre of our own universe and every region, town and small area believes that it can double its tourism product merely by announcing it.  Tourists will sort out their access and then they will sort out their accommodation.  From wherever one comes, particularly for overseas visitors, one is limited by the access and accommodation infrastructure.  Many of the issues we must deal with are exactly that there are ceilings on what we can deal with.  I refer to overseas visitors because that is really what we are talking about here in terms of a national tourism product.  From that point of view, is access infrastructure, whether air or ferry, an issue for both of the groups because they are in a peripheral area, like mine in west Cork, where it is an issue?<\/p><p>  I might ask Mr. Hynes and Ms Grehan this as well.  I served on Cork County Council for a number of years and one of the debates that was constantly being thrown at us was the clash between one's core functions as a local authority and the funds one spends to attract tourists to one's county.  For example, if the local authority funds something, it might throw &euro;30,000 to a worthy initiative to fund a tourism project, all of a sudden one would get a group asking should the local authority look more at its roads than at funding tourism and are there not tourism organisations to do that.<\/p><p>  I agree with Mr. Casey's point about keep the local tourism organisations' effort as near to the community or region as possible.  We had one in west Cork, West Cork Tourism, which, unfortunately, exhausted itself.  We identified that one of our major problems was ferry access into Cork to serve west Cork and south Kerry, West Cork Tourism put a Herculean effort into acquiring a vessel for the Cork-Swansea route and, in the end, it failed for one or two reasons.  It could have succeeded but the effort it took sucked the life from the West Cork Tourism project and it is finding it difficult to get that kick-started.<\/p><p>  In talking about having a local tourism organisation, is there any merit in saying that Ireland is a small country and tourists come here for different reasons, for example, on golf holidays?  If one were a golf enthusiast in the United States and looked online, he or she would say there are golf holidays in Cork and in Mayo, and could get a myriad of results.  One could get 20 different organisations offering golf holidays.  At the end of it, he or she will decide to go to Spain instead because Spain provides one golf holiday product and will direct him or her to it.  Would there be any merit in identifying sectoral tourism products nationally so that, whether it is genealogy, activities, sports or city breaks, there is one port?  One could be engaging and ask whether there is both a city and a genealogical interest, for example, Dublin and, maybe, Mayo, where one could tie-in both, but that it is a sectoral rather than a geographical issue.  One would be defining one's product, focusing on it and providing somebody who is focused with what he or she wants.<\/p><p>  I looked at the Pure Life Pure Irish website.  Mr. O'Hara's message is strong on anti-fracking.  It is only an observation - I do not want to go into the anti-fracking debate - but one point he made is it collapsed in some parts of the United States because the price of gas collapsed.

Those in County Mayo are definitely doing something right.  I visited the county last year and I am aware that it is extremely vibrant and busy.  Like my colleague, I also paid a visit to Matt Molloy's pub in Westport and had a fantastic night there.  The town itself was buzzing.  The first matter I am interested in is the historic towns initiative.  I live in Youghal which, like Westport, benefited from this initiative.  Will our guests from Mayo comment on the impact of the initiative on Westport?<\/p><p>  Mr. O'Hara's presentation was excellent, as is the product itself.  He made some great points with regard to winter tourism, college students and horses.  He even promoted Irish weather, which is unreal.  Mr. O'Hara referred to America and the fact that it is necessary to engage in marketing in respect of it on a 24-7 basis.  I do not know whether he was trying to say that Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland should be on duty 24-7 but perhaps they could operate on a shift basis.  I am disappointed that Pure Irish Life Tours is not getting funding, particularly as it has an excellent product.<\/p><p>  Mr. Casey made many interesting points, particularly in the context of the independent tourism organisations and international best practice.  He indicated that the entire island of Ireland should be marketed and promoted by one body, Tourism Ireland.  I hope that this would also involve co-operation via the North-South Ministerial Council.  Mr. Casey also referred to repeat visitors and the fact that we fare very poorly in the context of encourage people to return here.  Will he perhaps comment with regard to what we need to do to address this matter?  Does the fact that people do not return here relate to not having enough tourist attractions?  As Mr. Casey stated, Ireland has only half the number of tourist attractions as Scotland.  Is there a need to engage in further development or marketing?  We are trying to develop the Moore Street project and I am of the view that this would be a major asset to Dublin going forward.  A previous speaker referred to price and value for money.  Is the fact that there may not be great value for money one of the reasons for our not attracting repeat business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500014#P00100","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386252600,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I will be as brief as possible in replying.

Such compliments are very much appreciated.  When we started our journey to try to revive towns and encourage improvements to them, one of the places to which we would have looked would have been west Cork.  In particular, we would have looked to Kinsale - where Billy Houlihan was involved - and everything that happened there.  When it comes to marketing and product development, Kerry is streets ahead of the remainder of the country and not just in the context of football.  I am not engaging in pl&aacute;m&aacute;s.  We still seek to emulate what those in Kerry have been doing for a long time.<\/p><p>  I am an architect by profession and I worked as town manager in Westport for ten years.  I am old enough, therefore, to remember the heritage towns initiative being launched <i>circa<\/i> 1991.  That initiative kicked off a focus on historic cores as being an asset rather than a liability.  While the money allocated in respect of the historic towns initiative was not that great, the initiative itself has been very valuable to Westport as a branding and promotional exercise.  I do not have figures to illustrate its impact.  However, it was more valuable in terms of perception than in the context of the level of investment.<\/p><p>  The first issue to which I wish to refer in the context of Deputy Harrington's comments is gas.  Those who live in County Mayo happen to know a bit more about gas than their counterparts in most counties.  We have come through 12 very difficult years in respect of the relevant project.  No more than in war, truth was the first casualty during those 12 years.  One would have had to have lived through it in order to appreciate the amount of misinformation and damaging material put out by people who, for their own reasons, opposed the project.  There is a danger that the same thing will happen in the debate on fracking and this is something we need to avoid at all costs.  The UK report - which is the definitive one at present - states that it if is done properly, there is no environmental damage.  That is the point from which we should start.<\/p><p>  In the context of community enterprise and employment, there is always tension with regard to where we spend our money.  There is always a need to cut hedges, fill potholes or whatever.  We are involved in discussing budgets at present and, on balance, the members of the council greatly appreciate the fact that our job is to cater for communities, generate employment and support enterprise.  Tourism is a very fast win for everyone, including all of our elected members.  That is why we have their support.  The budget for this year is going to be trebled but we will have to wait and see how this is dealt with in the budget debate.  As a result of the involvement of the NRA, we are less involved with roads than use to be the case and we are also withdrawing from water services, although not precipitously.  This means that our role in the area of community enterprise and employment is going to be much bigger and stronger and more important than heretofore.  It is Government policy to get us involved in this regard.  Access is a major issue and I will ask Ms Grehan to discuss the airport and matters relating to it.<\/p><p>  Deputy Tom Fleming referred to the personal touch.  There are two aspects to this which we consider important and which should not be underestimated.  The first of these is the power of the county jersey.  There are times when we are stronger as regions or as a country, such as on St. Patrick's Day.  However, there are other times when the county jersey paves the way into places one wishes to go.  It is a question of using the jersey at the appropriate time.  The power of elected representatives must also be taken into consideration.  People should never underestimate the important role played by  those who represent the people of a county, particularly at functions, events, etc.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that 5% of the 70 million people across the globe who claim to be part of the Irish diaspora have roots in County Mayo.  This is actually a guesstimate and the figure could be much higher.<\/p><p>  I thank Deputy Griffin for writing his blog.  Anyone who comes to County Mayo and writes a blog about it is most welcome.  If he comes back, we will see if we can show our appreciation in some way.  We might even get him into Matt Molloy's pub.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500014#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hynes"},{"type":"speech","time":1386252600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I was there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500014#P00500","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386252600,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy also visit Nevin's in Tiernaur?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500014#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hynes"},{"type":"speech","time":1386252600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Possibly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500014#P00700","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386252600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>We will certainly see to it that he goes there on his return.<\/p><p>  We would welcome the establishment of further greenways.  I have a good friend who is managing director of Foxford Woolen Mills and he informed me that he would always prefer to see a mill opening as opposed to being closed.  If a mill is opening, then the market is rising.  Thereafter, it is only a question of being competitive and obtaining one's slice of the action.  We will attract many multiples of the current number of visitors to Ireland if we have sufficiently long networks.  We are working with our counterparts in County Galway, who are seeking to have the Oughterard to Clifden line converted to a greenway.  Our aim would be to try to connect this to Leenane.  The route will not be entirely off-road but we will try to ensure that as much of it as possible will be in order to create the network.  This would lead to the development of a greenway that would encompass a large chunk of the west coast.<\/p><p>  If there is one specific thing we might do at these proceedings, it would be to appeal to the Department with responsibility for the single farm payment scheme to review the way in which it operates.  Removing or reducing single farm payments has the potential to be an extremely precipitous move in respect of farmers who - for no return - have donated a small portion of their land for the common good.  It is really important that this matter is tackled.  Again, this goes to Government policy on the alignment of Departments and services at local level.  The latter cannot be progressed quickly enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500014#P00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Hynes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386252600,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I will be extremely brief.

Packages are a major issue in this area.  This year, we met a 92 year old man at Dublin Airport and brought him west.  I could not believe his age but he was on the Wild West Ireland tour with which we are involved.  Every two weeks, we have a dinner and banquet in the house with music and so forth.  Finding the man in question sitting back in a chair, relaxing with a glass of the good stuff, I asked him if he was enjoying his holiday, to which he replied, \"Where else could I be at 92 years of age?\"  He owns a major company in the United States and has written a great deal about Ireland since returning home.<\/p><p>  Blogging is great because it is important in social media to keep pushing different areas.  I hope Deputy Griffin will write about Country Leitrim the next time he visits.

Last week, we had two hotel owners, one from Russia and one from Bulgaria, staying in the house.  Chatting about the different markets I learned that bed and breakfast is available for &euro;6 per night in the Bulgarian's 20 bedroom hotel on the coast.  We heard great things on the night about different cultures, including the different things Russians like.  We will meet again in February and a friend, who owns a place in France, will join us in Bulgaria.  The purpose of the visit is to learn new things about different cultures and how we can help them and they can help us.  To help and have are great things. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500015#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John James O'Hara"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1386253200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>Deputy Griffin asked what Ireland can offer compared to Scotland.  To give an example, Dublin Castle lies on the main tourist route from the Book of Kells in Trinity College to the Guinness Storehouse.  The site generates revenue from tourism of &euro;500,000 per annum, whereas Edinburgh Castle generates annual revenue of &euro;20 million.  Edinburgh's attractions are not as stunning as some the attractions in Dublin would be if they were developed.  For instance, one cannot visit the Record Tower in Dublin Castle where Red Hugh O'Donnell was imprisoned because the Garda Museum, which nobody visits, blocks access to the stairs.  We are discussing this issue but given the rate of progress the Office of Public Works has achieved in recent years in turning Dublin Castle into a tourist attraction, it probably will be 20 years before revenue from the site reaches &euro;20 million.  The Secretary General to the Taoiseach must put his shoulder to the wheel in that regard.<\/p><p>  The Deputies referred to value for money for tourists in Ireland by international comparison.  This has improved in recent years.  The first issues that arises is access.  While there are access problems in some country areas, the two main access points have improved in recent years.  The decision in the budget to abolish the air travel tax and the creation of new routes at Shannon and Dublin airports have had an immediate impact.  Successful efforts to increase the number of tourists this year were due in part to supply side improvements, in other words, better access from the United States. <\/p><p>  Ireland has probably some of the cheapest grade 3 and 4 accommodation in Europe.  I will not make comparisons with Bulgaria as I am referring to mainstream accommodation.  The reason for the low prices is the recession and the number of hotels in receivership.  Accommodation costs have not been a tourist impediment in recent years. <\/p><p>  We compared Dublin, Edinburgh and Amsterdam for eating out and found that Dublin was cheaper for single Michelin star restaurants, whereas Amsterdam had many more bib gourmand restaurants where one can have three courses for &euro;29.  While I have no evidence on which to base my view, I suggest that the adjustment in the menu prices of restaurants since the recession has been much quicker in Dublin than in rural areas.<\/p><p>  On repeat visitors and ways to improve the tourist experience, we need the main tourist attractions to be organised locally.  As one of my colleagues says, it takes a village to rear a child and a locality to give a good tourist experience.  We also need more tourist attractions and to achieve this we need people to staff them cheaply.  We have only two or three major regional museums, yet the national collections are stored primarily in warehouses in County Kerry.  We need local authorities to investigate what could be provided to them on loan if they were to establish a local museum with 70% volunteer staffing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013120500015#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerome Casey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1386253800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Would it be possible to get a copy of the submission by Mayo County Council?
