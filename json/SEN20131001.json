I would like to call for a debate on this matter in advance of the budget .  All of us know that thousands of discretionary medical cards that had been given to people with long-term illnesses, including children - I am dealing with a number of such cases - and the elderly, have been withdrawn and are being reviewed.  It is taking months for any decision to be taken.  I remind the Leader that when this Government was formed, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, promised to extend medical cards to those with certain prescribed long-term illnesses.  As I noted earlier this year, he has since rowed back on that.  He has said that legal issues arise in this regard, apparently, so he does not intend to extend medical card eligibility.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister and Government to intervene in this area.  This is a growing crisis.  I am sure all of us have cases with which we are endeavouring to deal.  When one is dealing with a family whose child is completely non-responsive and mentally and physically disabled and who cannot walk and talk and needs full 24-hour care but who has had 80% of his or her respite care cut and, on top of that, has had his or her medical card withdrawn, nobody in their right mind could stand over that type of decision.  We need a proper debate on this to tease out what is really happening because it is getting worse and I do not think people will stand for it.  If the Minister came in here, it would give him an opportunity to hear specific testimony from people all over the country with whom we are dealing.  Senator Kelly has raised this issue on numerous occasions and I and other colleagues respect him for doing so but we are not getting anywhere with it.  It is getting worse and needs to be addressed.

Like many, I was in attendance at the weekend when the extension of votes to Irish citizens resident outside the State, for example, in Northern Ireland, was debated.  It was an interesting debate that saw moving presentations from representatives of the diaspora in countries as far away as Australia, the US and European countries.  They argued passionately for the extension of voting rights in presidential elections at least.  The Government must respond to the recommendations of the convention within four months.  That period is due to run out shortly on the report recommending a change to the Constitution to allow for marriage equality.  Similarly, we should debate the strong recommendation of the convention in respect of the extension of voting rights.  That 78% of members were in favour of an extension is a ringing endorsement of the principle.

Nevertheless, teachers have been subject to a significant diminution of their resources.

It would therefore be worthwhile if the Government and ASTI leaders met to discuss how the new junior cycle could be implemented without the problems involved in it.

This figure has more than doubled since 2008.  The average time taken to address these issues has also doubled from two years in 2008 to almost five years in 2012.  These are issues that must be examined in more detail given that during the five years concerned the Government has had to cut back substantially in the resources available to hospitals and clinicians throughout the country.  It is clear there is some level of correlation between this and the lack of available care in terms of numbers of doctors, hours being worked and so on.  This must be addressed, particularly in the context of the inordinate hours which junior doctors will be forced to work from next week.  This is a serious issue.<\/p><p>I join with colleagues in condemning the terrible events in Athlone in recent days.  It was reported recently that the HSE had failed to provide timely support and services over several years to a child who had made multiple allegations.  It also failed to allocate a social worker or to make arrangements for face-to-face meetings.  This indicates our system is failing from beginning to end.

It is a pity the Government felt it had to resort to misleading the public in order to prevail and win the day.  It is a pity also it did not put as much effort into ensuring a good turn-out on Friday.  The expectation is that the public is not exercised by or engaged in this matter because the Government has failed to prove its case and that turn-out will be less than 30%, which means that 15% of the electorate will decide the outcome.  As a democrat, I will accept and respect the decision of the public and electorate regardless of the result.  Nevertheless, it is dangerous that such a serious and important matter will be decided by a low number of people.  I suggest, therefore, that if the Government is, as it claims, bent on and serious about reform, one such reform should be that for any referendum result to be valid and credible in law and to have any authority turn-out must be at least 50%.  Such provision prevails in many other European countries.  I urge the Government to at least consider that matter.<\/p><p>Yesterday in Portlaoise and throughout the country there were lengthy queues outside motor tax offices of people trying to comply with the law.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who rightly introduced legislation to close off a loophole which allowed for tax evasion in regard to motor vehicles and resulted in a loss to the Exchequer of &euro;50 million, to ensure people trying to comply with that law, many of whom are elderly, are not penalised in respect of late registration.  As it is not possible to register off-road vehicles, many of them vintage tractors and so on, online, there were lengthy queues at 3.30 p.m. yesterday outside motor tax offices throughout the country.  These people wish to comply with the law and should be given an opportunity to do so.

This is a case of massive administrative insensitivity, not to speak of incompetence.  Only last week, an owner of a Massey Ferguson 35, whom I met me at the ploughing championships, informed me that the brown tax book for his tractor had been lost.  Number plates used to be painted on many of these older tractors and now that the tax book is long lost, the owner must incur significant expense if he is to meet the requirement to re-register his tractor.  This is a classic example of a failure to foresee the types of problems that could arise when a measure is introduced.<\/p><p>As Senator Whelan noted, queues have formed outside motor tax offices.  Why was an online system of registration not made available?  How will those who have emigrated tax vehicles that are off the road?  Why was better notice not given of the new measure?  Will the deadline be extended?  The Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government must explain the position to the House.  People should be given until the end of the year to register vehicles that are off the road and an online system should be introduced to in order that people are no longer required to queue for hours.  One must bear in mind that many motor tax offices are understaffed.  Farmers must leave their land and others must leave their offices to join the queue.  This is not an acceptable approach to administration.<\/p><p>In the case of older tractors, the registration fee, which has increased significantly in recent years, should be reduced to the previous rate of &euro;50.

I listened with great interest to a woman who was protesting about the crime outside a local Garda station.  She stated we should forget the Seanad referendum and protect our children.  In this regard, to respond to those who argue the Seanad has not done anything, this Seanad produced the most effective protection of children in the guardian <i>ad litem<\/i> legislation.  Last year, a judge of the High Court described the Act as the most important protection for children that had been produced by the Legislature.  We have done our job and we should continue to make that point in response to statements from people such as a functionary of the Labour Court who found it difficult to tell the truth this morning when he debated with our colleague, Senator Feargal Quinn.  For example, he stated that in the referendum in 1979, the university Senators opposed the proposal to extend the vote and further democratise the Seanad.  That was an absolute lie.  I have been a Senator for 27 years or most of the period since the 1979 referendum and on every single occasion we have stated we want democratisation.  People should stop lying, irrespective of which side they are on.  The same individual stated there were only 28 Senators present for the debate on the social welfare Bill.  That is rubbish.  The reason there were 20 from the Government side and 15 from the other side present was that there was a guillotine on the Bill.  The individual in question wants empty political gestures rather than hard, serious work.<\/p><p>  People should read the article published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> a couple of weeks ago by a professor from New South Wales in which he analysed the position in New Zealand, which is cited in this argument.  New Zealand is doing everything possible to reverse its decision to abolish its upper house.  It is introducing legislation to this end and has tried various other Bills.  The country &quot;stumbled into&quot; abolition - that was the phrase used - and found that it resulted in an increased concentration of power.  Once a parliamentary chamber has been abolished, it is damned difficult to restore it. <\/p><p>  With regard to the posters, they are pure lies, as has been pointed out.  There is no question that the sum referred to would be saved and no reputable authority has ever stated that amount of money could be saved.<\/p> <p>The result from the Referendum Commission is very disappointing.  It has no role in respect of regulation of campaign materials.  The Standards in Public Office Commission said that it had no statutory function in respect of information on posters erected by political parties.  This is shocking.  In other words, the two bodies charged with the conduct of elections cannot stop a Government or another party deliberately lying.  That should be looked at.  It is not their fault they were given the wrong mandate.<\/p><p>My final thing is a direct appeal to the Cathaoirleach because of the respect in which he is held.  I call on our true, brave and courageous Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, to ask the Cathaoirleach that he might consider, tomorrow, the example of Thomas Westropp Bennett, who was Cathaoirleach of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1936 when it was abolished.  He said that the matter was so serious that he could not address it from the Chair.  He left the Chair and joined the body of the assembly of the Seanad and spoke passionately in its favour.  That is the precedent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100008#G00500","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380636900,"counter":42,"content":"<p>It is a great idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100009#H00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1380636900,"counter":43,"content":"<p>We have already extinguished two parliaments in Ireland to our disadvantage, Grattan's Parliament and Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1936.

Many of them I spoke to were unable to acquire the necessary documentation to do that.  In fairness to the Minister, I do not think he realised that there would be so much compliance coming forward over this period.  It is unfair to say that everyone left this to the last minute and as a result we have these queues.  That is untrue.  I rang the motor tax office four weeks ago and I asked about my daughter's driving licence application.  The people working there said it would be suspended and that they were not going to deal with any driving licences applications until after 30 April because, even at that time, they were snowed under with the workload involved in this project.

In upholding a complaint by a family, she found that the HSE's actions had negatively affected the child involved.  She was critical of the HSE's failure to allocate a social worker, its failure to arrange an early face-to-face meeting with the child and its failure to provide psychological or therapeutic services to the child.  She was also critical of the significant problems in communication between the HSE and the child's mother which resulted in a breakdown of the relationship between the mother and the HSE.<\/p><p>I do not hold the Government responsible for all complaints made by individuals to the HSE.  I take the view that the Government cannot micromanage everything that happens in the health services generally.  However, we seem to have a systemic problem in the State in how we deal with complaints relating to children, allegations of child abuse and how the HSE and its policies protect children when complaints are made.  This is a serious case.  A serious complaint was made and upheld by the Ombudsman for Children.  We must have regard to that.  Despite all the debates we have had in the House, and there have been many passionate debates by people on all sides, on how we can improve the relationship between the State and children, how we can improve services that the State provides and how we can improve protections for children, we still have failures in the system.<\/p> <p>This is just one example of many of which Members are aware.

In the week on which the people are being asked to vote on the future of this House, this is bad and it is regrettable the business again is so light.  While I do not necessarily blame the Leader for this, in all the calls made by Senators on all sides for a range of issues to be debated in this House, for only one legislative item and not more to be on the Order of Business is a mistake.

It is important that the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Department of Health engage to try to do everything possible to avoid this strike going ahead.  The entire health service as it exists is facing major challenges and any kind of strike action will only cause further difficulties for those who work each day in the hospitals.  It will affect patients and it is important that efforts are made to resolve this issue as soon as possible.  However, it also is important that this issue regarding junior doctors be faced up to.  While it has been kicked around the place for the past 15 or 20 years, no fundamental change yet has been made as to how the junior doctors are employed.

Such a change is long overdue as the diaspora often is taken for granted, even while its members' importance for the welfare of Ireland, because of the status they have acquired in the countries of their adoption, is forgotten.  They play a central role, as well as having played a central role in helping decision-makers in other countries to focus on Ireland when we needed such help.  I certainly had hoped that a time would come when representatives of the diaspora also would sit in this Chamber.  I would have thought this would have formed part of greater reform.  Senator Barrett has put his finger on it regarding the referendum on the Seanad: we treat very lightly our people in Northern Ireland and our people in the Irish diaspora.

It is amazing that we are into the budgetary arithmetic yet there is no conversation about the budget in two weeks time.  I do not know if people saw the figures but the levy placed upon a bottle of wine in the last budget brought in &euro;45 million in eight months.  If there are to be tax increases, those are the type of areas we should be targeting.  Specifically, I would like to see a similar levy placed upon carry-out beer from the off-licence market.  Supermarkets in particular are doing enormous damage with their below cost selling.  They do not get any profit on their cheap beer but once they get the customers in they skin them on other products.  We could finally impact upon them by placing a similar levy or tax in that area.  If it worked on a bottle of wine I am sure it can work on a carry-out bottle of beer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100014#N01700","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1380638700,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I join with the Members who spoke earlier.

When I played football I always played the ball rather than the man.  The fact that the press release which, I think, came from Fine Gael head office, questioned the voting record of two named Members in addition to Fianna F&aacute;il Senators is despicable and unacceptable.  Many Fine Gael Members in this House certainly do not stand over it.  I apologise to the two Members - even though I had nothing whatsoever to do with the matter - on behalf of the Members in this House.  They are two of the most distinguished Members of the House.  I hope that they will accept our apologies.<\/p><p> Senator Bacik called for a debate on the reports of the Constitutional Convention.  We will try to arrange that as soon as we can.  Her call for a debate on climate change and global warming is even more important given the report that came out last week.  <\/p><p> Senator Barrett reminded us of <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>poll and the importance of the Seanad to people in Northern Ireland .  He also mentioned some of the messages that he had received in that regard.<\/p><p> Senator Barrett also raised an important and serious issue that other Members alluded to as well, which is the fact that a Member of the other House is reported to have said that he was offered a bribe in the Senate in 2009.  We had a similar situation in this House not so long ago.  I told that Member at the time - which is what I say to the Member of the other House - that if they were offered a bribe that is a most serious matter that should be reported to the Garda.  I would hope that the Member in question has already reported the matter, given that the incident was perceived to have happened in 2009.  I note Senator's Wilson's comments on the matter.  He was the Government Whip at the time, so I understand how he feels when such allegations are made.  I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon will bring the matter to the attention to the Garda, which is what I asked Senator Landy to do when he previously made similar comments in newspapers.<\/p><p> Senator D'Arcy mentioned the ASTI's rejection of the Haddington Road agreement.  I respect his considered observations on the matter.  Senators MacSharry and Burke referred to the clinical indemnity scheme and junior doctors.  I hope that the issue with junior doctors can be resolved before next Tuesday when it is understood that the junior doctors will be taking industrial action.  Such action is certainly not in the interests of any patients or people seeking medical assistance.  I hope that the Labour Relations Commission or some such body will use its good offices in that regard. <\/p> <p>However, the Labour Relations Commission appears to be busy dealing with many other matters.<\/p><p>Senators Whelan, Mullen and Kelly referred to turnouts for referenda and the loophole in respect of motor taxation.

We will be dealing with the 15 amendments tabled in respect of Committee Stage of a Bill.  I can only ask Ministers to come before the House, I cannot command them to do so.  I have asked several Ministers to come before us in order that they might deal with a number of items but I have not received very positive results, particularly in the past couple of weeks.  I will certainly continue to try to bring Ministers before the House to make statements on various issues which Members raise.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the Constitutional Convention and the possibility of members of the diaspora being allowed to vote.  He also referred to issues relating to the referendum campaign on the Seanad.  This matter was addressed by many Members, including Senators O'Sullivan and Mullins, particularly in the context of the cost involved.<\/p><p>Senator Brennan commented on the introduction of electronic tagging in respect of convicted criminals.  I will try to establish what is the position of the Minister for Justice and Equality on that matter and report back to the Senator.<\/p><p>Senator Wilson requested that the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Cannon, come before the House and use his right to privilege in order to name the person involved in a particular matter.  We tried to contact the Minister of State's offices and I understand he is attending a meeting of OECD Education Ministers in Istanbul at present.

I also wonder about the position of elected representatives or officeholders who may be blacklisted because they blow the whistle.<\/p> <p>Again, they are not in the same type of employer-employee relationship and the difficulties in that regard which is addressed in the legislation, but they can, if they speak out of both sides of their mouths, be subjected to blacklisting.  For example, even though this legislation follows on from the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, it would be of no practical benefit to the county councillor who gave evidence of bribery at that tribunal, except in so far as it introduces a broader culture of whistleblowing.  One of the amendments I have tabled for Report Stage proposes the inclusion in this legislation of officeholders of State under the Constitution and Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  While these are not people who would be seeking compensation in terms of an infringement of the Employment Acts they are people who might well be looking for protection within a party or council structure.  Councillors who blow the whistle in respect of wrongdoing could be blacklisted by officials and suffer appalling consequences for doing so.  While their relationship is not an employer-employee relationship it is very similar.  While I may, perhaps, be broadening this out too much, the only hope such people would have is that this legislation will change the culture and thereby help them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100019#U01100","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380640500,"counter":120,"content":"<p>On Second Stage we discussed at length the main aim of the suite of reform legislation to change the culture.  One cannot craft legislation to suit every individual case.  This legislation is, by and large, to protect the whistleblower in the workplace.  It defines the workplace, the redress available to whistleblowers and protections against penalisation being visited upon them.  There is a separate array of occasions outside of the workplace when proper whistleblowing should occur.  As the Deputy said, this could relate to information one receives as a public representative, of which I have some experience.  I know personally how much on the hazard one can be in terms the High Court and Supreme Court challenges taken against me for trying to out allegations of corruption in Donegal and the &euro;0.5 million in legal fees in that regard, which I did not have the wherewithal to pay.  I understand that.  However, that is outside this process.  It is not possible to formulate a whistleblowing regime to protect against a person being on the hazard for doing the right thing.  I believe most people, certainly those in public life, be that at council or Oireachtas level, will take that risk.<\/p><p>Where it would impact is in the case of a person in the planning or other office in the council who became aware of wrongdoing and outed it, which would live him or her very vulnerable.

The Minister will be aware that section 5(3)(<i>f) <\/i>refers to wrongdoing as including the unlawful or improper use of funds or resources of a public body.  However, subsection (3) does not include in the definition of wrongdoing undue influence by a public official, particularly in relation to the administration of justice and the proper functioning of State organs.  To highlight that the legislation is being introduced to improve accountability and transparency for all public officials, such a provision should be included.  In this case, a public official should include Members of the Oireachtas and all civil and public servants.  The amendment also suggests that the current restriction to misuse of public funds is too limiting and should be expanded.  This is important in terms of sending out a message about accountability and transparency.  Furthermore it is proposed in the OECD toolkit on whistleblower protection that protected disclosures should be defined to include an abuse of authority.<\/p> <p>The addition to the definition of \"undue influence\" would be in keeping with the idea of combating corruption, as outlined in the White Paper produced by the Department of Justice and Equality on white collar crime, for which the Department used Transparency International's definition.  The latter organisation was very helpful in the development of the legislation and the Minister was very receptive to its input, as were his officials.  According to Transparency International's definition, corruption is the misuse of public entrusted power for private gain.  In that regard, this Bill could be linked to relevant Department of Justice and Equality legislation.  I have proposed the amendment for this reason. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100020#V00600","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380640800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and her colleagues for proposing the amendment, which would insert a new relevant wrongdoing that could be reported upon for the purposes of making protected disclosure.

We could all come up with half a dozen types of wrongdoing that could be specified in the Bill.  However, the more one specifies, the more one weakens.  We need an overarching concept that will ensure that when these matters are tested in the courts, the overarching definitions are sufficiently robust to capture them.  The advice I have been given is that the more one specifies, the more it is open to argue in the courts that a particular category must be excluded on the basis that it is not specifically mentioned in the Bill.  The general approach, therefore, is to have broad definitions to capture as much wrongdoing as possible.

Matters that do not reach the level of criminality are not necessarily covered by the definition in section 5(3) and criminality may be absent in the case of undue influence being exercised by a public official.  What is the position regarding breaches of competition law or Articles 101 and 102 of the EU treaty?  While there is specific provision on this matter in the Competition Act, a good faith defence is available in that disclosure under the Act must be done in good faith.  Such disclosures do not always reach the standard of criminal activity and could well be civil breaches.  The same applies with regard to the Companies Act.  Certain serious breaches of the Act are not offences under section 5(3)(a).  They may constitute lack of compliance with a legal obligation but fall into the category of civil offences or breaches.  I refer specifically to the Competition Act and Articles 101 and 102 of the EU treaties, the analogous provisions in Europe.  If, for example, two major multinational companies were found to have entered into a price fixing arrangement, Ireland would not have a role in the matter, as such matters are dealt with at European level where whistleblowing protection is in place.  Under the definition in section 5(3), protection will not be afforded to a person in Ireland who blows the whistle on major price fixing but does not do so in good faith.<\/p> <p>It is not an offence, it is arguable whether there is an issue of failure of legal obligations, it is not a miscarriage of justice, it is not a health and safety matter or a matter of the environment, it is not the misuse of funds of a public body or an act of omission of a public body and it is not the destruction of information.  I believe there is a category of wrongdoing not covered by the legislation and Senator Zappone's amendment touches on that.<\/p><p>My Report Stage amendments cover the Competition Acts and Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which relate to price-fixing, reputed dominance at European level and breaches of the Companies Act which do not reach the level of criminality.

A person could be disbarred from being a director for serious wrongdoing but that person may not be guilty of an offence and I wonder whether that has been considered.

This was not the fault of the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  He inherited them that way and they have subsequently improved.  Anyway, at the time it struck me that a rather concentrated level of intimidation was brought to bear on me when I blew these whistles in public arenas, having tried to go through the normal channels first.  An inquiry was made about whether my employment in St. Vincent's Hospital could be terminated.<\/p> <p>Thankfully for me, I had passed that one year probation stage in the old contract beyond which one really could only be terminated pretty much for moral turpitude.  Prior to that stage, one was there pretty much at the discretion of the employing authority.

Under the Planning and Development Act 2000 interim orders may be made, pending the case being heard.  This proposal is based on the principle that, pending the complaint of unfair dismissal being finally determined by the Employment Appeals Tribunal at the Labour Court, a form of injunctive interim relief either preventing the dismissal or reinstating the employee, after the act of dismissal, would be available from the Circuit Court.  That court already has extensive experience hearing appeals of unfair dismissal cases.  Therefore, there would be no-brainer inclination towards curial deference when determining where an arguable case lies.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the granting of injunctive relief is not alien to industrial relations law.  For example, section 19 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 deals with circumstances under which the court may, or may not, grant an injunction to the employer, which is in line with the Campus Oil guidelines, as the unfair dismissal will have a serious and detrimental consequence for the employee contrary to the public interest purpose of the legislation. <\/p><p>Awards and damages are not a sufficient remedy for an unfairly dismissed employee, especially as unfair dismissal cases take an average of two years to be heard currently.  A two-year period without pay will affect employees.  It will affect their ability to pay a mortgage, for example, or meet any other borrowing requirements.  This, combined with the ongoing negative impact on career and the damage to their name and reputation caused by the whiff of sulphur surrounding a dismissal.  They all combine in such a way that the existing system of redress, in the sole form of compensation for financial loss, is unsuitable and does not provide adequate protection.  The core principle of justice delayed is justice denied applies in this instance.  The balance of convenience should be to preserve the employee in his or her job and to protect him or her from unfair dismissal when reporting a wrongdoing.  I know that the Minister said that he would examine the matter on Second Stage and I am interested in hearing his comments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100023#Y01700","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380642300,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Do I have a seconder for the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100024#Z00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1380642300,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100024#Z00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1380642300,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and her colleagues for tabling this important amendment.  I referenced the matter on Second Stage.  I note that the amendment is long and detailed and it is obvious that a lot of thought has gone into its drafting.  In order to be helpful to the House I shall set out the provenance of interim relief in the whole area of whistleblowing legislation.<\/p><p>  The potential for granting interim relief is an important protection available to whistleblowers who claim that they have been dismissed for whistleblowing under section 9 of the groundbreaking UK whistleblowing protection legislation, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1988.  In the UK if an employment tribunal concludes that an employee is likely to win his or her case at a full hearing it, that is the Employment Tribunal of the UK, can make an order <i>pro tem<\/i> that employees be re-employed or that the employment is deemed to continue so the employee will continue to receive salary.<\/p><p>  The experience in the UK is that the granting of this protection in a whistleblowing case is relatively rare.  The employment tribunal must be satisfied that there is more than a reasonable expectation that the case will succeed at a full hearing of the tribunal.  Moreover, the tribunal's assessment must be made in circumstances that the tribunal does not seek to prejudge the outcome of issues which are not properly set out before it at that stage, before the full hearing adduces all of the evidence and all of the matters are fully tested and heard.<\/p><p>  Claims for interim relief would be expected to arise only in a very small minority of cases.  Granting of interim relief is likely to be the exception rather than the rule.  Notwithstanding, I think there might be cases where it is justified. <\/p> <p>As I said on Second Stage, Ireland is not like the UK inasmuch as the judicial capacity of our labour relations bodies is circumscribed by the Constitution.  The issue must therefore be assessed in the context of the legal and constitutional structures for employment rights that are operated in this State.<\/p><p>My Department has been in detailed consultation with the Attorney General on this issue.  I am well disposed to examining if we can find some way in which interim relief could be provided, but there are a number of constitutional hurdles.  One is that to prejudge a case before all evidence is adduced is very difficult in our jurisdiction, because under the Constitution the issue of bias arises in the same tribunal coming to a conclusion subsequently.  There are other issues in terms of costs that might arise that would be determined not by a court but by a tribunal set up under law.  On the basis of the consultations my Department has had, and is continuing to have, with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which has overall responsibility for employment rights and employment legislation, the legal feasibility of doing what I would like to do is being fully examined.  With the permission of the Senator and the House, I seek the opportunity to continue that examination to see if I can find a solution before the Bill progresses further in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100024#Z00400","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380642600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>In view of what the Minister said about the legal feasibility being examined, I will not press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100025#AA00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380642600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\nSECTION 11<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380642600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 3 is out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100025#AA00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1380642600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Can I ask a question about that?

I will outline the reason the section is in the Bill.  Again, it relates to the experience in the United Kingdom and I mentioned it in my speech on Second Stage.  It is about the good faith test.  There was a good faith test in the original UK legislation.  It was expected that somebody who was whistleblowing would act in good faith.  However, I have taken that out of this Bill because there could be instances where wrongdoing is outed not for the best of reasons.  That does not make the wrongdoing any less real, or outing it any less important or valuable.  Section 11(<i>e<\/i>) mirrors the compromise that was arrived at within the British system, whereby in dealing with cases where the good faith test was not met, it was determined that if the motivation was less than wholesome, the compensation available should be less.  Bluntly, I am uncomfortable with that.  Had the amendment been in order, I would have indicated that I will reflect upon it further.<\/p> <p> There is much argument internationally about this.  We are all guided by our experience but I know that in the Donegal case, with which I am very familiar, one of the breakthroughs was motivated by less than wholesome motivation.  It was a marriage break-up issue.  As a result of the marriage break-up, one of the spouses determined to blow the whistle on the other spouse.  The fact that spouse was doing things which were not only wrong but criminal was exposed as a result.  Did that make the wrongdoing, or the exposing of it, any less important?  There are purists who would say \"Yes\" and that there should be a higher threshold of protection to one if one's motivation is more wholesome.  <\/p><p>The Senator is right in that section 5(7) states: &quot;The motivation for making a disclosure is irrelevant to whether or not it is a protected disclosure.&quot;  That is true, therefore it categorises a protected disclosure regardless of motivation but whether the degree of compensation should always be the same, irrespective of motivation, is a matter for debate.  On balance, I am minded to agree with Senator Zappone on that and will reflect further between now and Report Stage.  I hope I have not been too convoluted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100025#AA01200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380642900,"counter":172,"content":"<p>No.  I will take it that the Minister will reflect further.

The disclosure of the identity is actionable but we think this could still benefit from a stronger level of protection to one of sanction.  In addition, the current level of protection could be quite weak in practice because it requires all reasonable steps to be taken to protect identity which, in itself, is not particularly strong as a standard.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 4, therefore, seeks to strengthen the standard of protection.  <\/p><p> Furthermore, in this section there is no breach of identity protection if the person to whom the protective disclosure is made or referred reasonably believes that the person by whom the protected disclosure was made does not object to the disclosure of any such information.  That seems to be an odd and loosely drawn exception and certainly does not attach to the section a sense of importance of protecting the whistleblower's identity.  Identification of the whistleblower could have serious consequences for their future employment, among other things, and should be strongly protected in the legislation.<\/p><p> That leads me to amendment No. 5 in which we suggest the deletion of subsection (2)(<i>a<\/i>).  We do not see the rationale for it.  Apologies if I dealt with two amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100026#BB01300","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380643200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>The Senator's first amendment, No. 4, proposes to replace &quot;all reasonable steps&quot; in section 16(1) with the new phrase &quot;reasonable and available measures&quot;.  Replacing &quot;all reasonable steps&quot;, which is what I want, with &quot;reasonable and available steps&quot; actually weakens it because we will have to determine the steps that were available to the person.  I believe that is a weakening of the provision in simple English and that the phrase I have included is stronger.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 5 proposes the deletion of subsection (2)(<i>a<\/i>) in section 16, which permits the identification of a disclosure in the case that a recipient of a protected disclosure reasonably believes that the person by whom the disclosure was made could not object to being identified.  There will be many cases where the whistleblower does not have any difficulty with being identified and if that is self-evident and manifest, it might help the advancement of the case.  If the person is content to say: &quot;I work for this company and we are pumping out toxic waste into the river, which I think is a disgrace, and I am willing to say that because I was the one who did it&quot;, that would help in the investigation.  There is no pressure on the person but where somebody is willing, and it often is the case that somebody is willing to do that, I do not see that that should not be permitted.<\/p><p>  If we look at section 16(2), there are cases where disclosure may be justified for the effective investigation of the relevant wrongdoing, the prevention of serious risk to the security of the State, public health, public safety or the environment, or the prevention of crime or the prosecution of a criminal offence.  I have personal experience in that these matters were tested in our highest courts where innocence at stake is an issue.  It is important, to protect somebody from serious harm, that the identity might be disclosed.  It is crafted in the best way to protect workers in the round but also in cases where serious harm either to the environment, the security of the State or the carrying out of natural justice, or any justice matter, it is important to ensure the legislation in section 16 is crafted in a fair and reasonable way.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 6 proposes to criminalise the intentional disclosure of information identifying a person who has made a protected disclosure.  That is a step up.  The issue of criminalisation was dealt with in some detail in the regulatory impact assessment I published with the Bill; I am sure the Senator has had a chance to read that.  In the regulatory impact assessment the case was made that the potential for a worker to be criminalised in the legislation presents a very significant impediment against reporting.  Since one of the primary underlining objectives of the legislation is to encourage workers to come forward and disclose concerns of wrongdoing, any potential, however remote, that an action of such whistleblowing would result in criminal prosecution is undesirable.  In addition, I am advised by the Attorney General that any potential criminalisation of a worker, in the absence of equivalent criminalisation of an employer, is unlikely to be perceived as securing balance in the treatment of employer and employee under the legislation.<\/p> <p>In view of the objective to encourage disclosures of wrongdoing and taking into account the uneven treatment in the matter of criminalisation both within and across the span of sectoral statutes, the proposed legislation does not therefore include any provision for the criminalisation of workers or employers.  We should not go down that route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100027#CC00200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380643500,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Will the Minister comment on what is meant by \"actionable\" in section 16?

In the context of its research on whistleblower protection, the OECD has indicated that, as a priority for legislation, awareness raising should be regularly undertaken in order to encourage the reporting of wrongdoing and corruption and that existing information on the protection of whistleblowers should be disseminated.  The OECD also states that it is important that whistleblower protection should be supported through effective awareness-raising, communication and training efforts and that communicating to public or private sector employees their rights and obligations when exposing wrongdoing is essential.  It is for these reasons we have tabled amendment No. 7.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100028#DD00900","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380643800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The amendment proposes the insertion of additional subsections into section 21.  The latter requires that every public body shall establish and maintain procedures for dealing with protected disclosures.  There are two elements to the proposed new subjection (3) put forward by the Senators.  The first would require the adoption by public bodies of guidelines pursuant to the operation of the Act and the second is a requirement that all workers in public bodies should be made aware of the protected disclosures legislation.  As it stands, in section 21(2) the Bill provides that public bodies will be required to provide their workers with written information regarding the procedures they are required to establish and maintain under the section 21(1).  In the context of the dissemination of such rules and procedures in common practice within the Irish public service - I do not envisage any difficulty with the requirements being fully discharged in the latter - it is also anticipated that steps taken by public bodies to provide workers with information of the nature envisaged under section 21(2) will, of necessity, refer to the protected disclosures legislation.  It should also be noted that the requirement to inform the employees of public bodies of those written procedures also extends to former employees.<\/p><p>In terms of advising workers generally of the existence of the legislation and as I have already indicated, my Department is currently giving detailed consideration to the most appropriate and effective means of disseminating that information broadly across all workplaces once the legislation has been enacted.  It is expected that the code of practice being developed by the Labour Relations Commission, in conjunction with employer and employee representatives, would provide a significant vehicle for the dissemination of such information.<\/p><p>The second part of the amendment would involve the insertion of a new subsection (4) into section 21.  The proposal put forward envisages a role for the Standards in Public Office Commission in the preparation of guidelines relating to the operation of legislation.  As previously indicated, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has requested that the Labour Relations Commission prepare a code of practice in respect of the practical day-to-day operation of the legislation.  I have had dealings with all sorts of public bodies.  The Labour Relations Commission is the organisation best equipped  - and obviously the most rational choice - to perform this task.  With due respect to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, the Clerk of the Seanad, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ceann Comhairle and the Ombudsman, the Standards in Public Office Commission does not possess as well-defined a skill-set as the Labour Relations Commission in the context of doing this job.

In light of the Minister's comments last week, we do not see this as an attempt to provide a monitor of those monitoring rather it is an effort to include in legislation a way to monitor complaints across the board so that any systemic issues within or across public services are identified and to ensure that whistleblowers are not being victimised.  Furthermore, we believe this could significantly assist with the review of the legislation following the five year period, on which the Minister had a discussion earlier with Senator Thomas Byrne.  I agree that in some ways the time period is important.  However, also important is how the review will be conducted.  If there were measures in place as proposed in the context of amendment No. 8 this would facilitate the collection of information over the five years on which the review could be based, as distinct from looking back over four or five years and trying to collect that information.  <\/p><p>  In reference to the OECD, international best practice outlines that steps should be taken to evaluate the effectiveness of whistleblower protection laws and policies.  The legislation as drafted provides, by and large, for a five year review.  The amendment suggests that systematically collecting data and information over a period of time is a means of evaluating the effectiveness of the whistleblowing mechanism and that an independent public body could ensure systematic data collection regarding the number of cases, etc..  We believe the amendment proposed is in keeping with that particular approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100030#FF00200","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1380644100,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Again, I do not agree with giving such an oversight role to the Standards in Public Office Commission.

The new elements included in the amendment correspond closely to what is acknowledged as the fundamental objectives which I have set out for this legislation, namely, the promotion of openness, accountability and transparency and the prevention of corruption.  These themes also strongly reflect my motivation in bringing forth this legislation.  Explicitly referencing transparency and accountability in the Long Title may, I am advised, have the unintended affect of limiting the scope of the legislation.  A broad range of wrongdoings are encompassed by the Bill.  Public disclosure of certain wrongdoings would contribute to increased transparency and accountability.  However, the primary purpose of the Bill is to promote disclosure for the purposes of having any wrongdoing investigated.  The stepped disclosure regime put in place through this Bill facilitates external disclosure or disclosure to a regulator or Minister over and above the external disclosures into the public domain.  It is not accurate to imply in the Long Title that the Bill is mainly aimed at prevention of corruption.  That is just one of its aims, as there are many other forms of wrongdoing covered by the legislation.<\/p><p>I will try to put it in simpler terms.  The Long Title of the Bill is understood in the legal profession and by the courts as setting the objectives of the Bill.  There is only an amendment to the Long Title if there is an additionality proposed that is not an essential part of the Bill.  As such, the Long Title has to be expanded to encompass that.

I understand the report of the national steering committee was to be published in 2013.

I met one of the young women and her parents on Saturday morning.  She has pacemakers implanted in her stomach and bowel and is fed intravenously because of the rare disorder from which she suffers.  Her case highlighted to me the importance of making progress on this issue.  The problem in the case of Ireland is that the numbers suffering from specific rare conditions are so small that a co-operation with other jurisdictions is required to address the matter.  We need a detailed plan for dealing with these diseases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100031#GG00900","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1380644700,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Colm Burke for raising this important issue and providing me with an opportunity to update the House on progress in the development of the national plan for rare diseases.  Rare diseases are life-threatening or chronic debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people.  Between 5,000 and 8,000 rare diseases have been described, affecting between 6% and 8% of the population in the course of their lives.  Approximately 80% of rare diseases have a genetic origin and the life expectancy of patients with such diseases is significantly reduced.  Many of the relevant conditions are complex, severe and debilitating.<\/p><p>With regard to the plan for rare diseases, about which the Senator asked, Ireland has been supportive of European Union proposals on rare disease, which concluded with a Council recommendation in June 2009.  The end point is that countries are recommended to develop plans or strategies, preferably by the end of 2013.  Ireland is well advanced in this work.<\/p><p>In January 2011, EUROPLAN, the European Project for Rare Diseases National Plans Development, organised a national conference bringing together patients, patient organisations and health care professionals to discuss what could feed into the development of a national strategy for rare diseases.  In April 2011, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, established a national steering group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and the requirement to be patient centred.  The policy will operate over a five year period, take account of the Council recommendation on rare diseases of 2009 and define priority actions subject to resource availability.<\/p><p>The national steering group is working on many areas relevant to the issue of rare diseases including the following.  The identification of appropriate centres of expertise for rare diseases is a key priority.  The EUROPLAN report which examined services across Europe commented that in most countries there are no designated centres of expertise and, even where they exist, there is significant variation in their organisation and how they operate.  A second area being worked on is access to appropriate medication and technology in the context of transparent processes to ensure equitable access to orphan drugs as well as the issue of orphan drug development.  <\/p><p>Research is an integral part of overall care for rare diseases, including access to clinical trials where appropriate.  The national steering group is considering the most appropriate registries and databases which can be used to plan and manage services in Ireland.  A fourth area being considered is the empowerment of patient organisations.  The EUROPLAN report contains a great deal of practical guidance on measures that can be taken to empower patients and their families in a meaningful way.<\/p><p>A national consultation day for stakeholders was held in Farmleigh in June 2012.  This was followed by an online consultation.  The Institute of Public Health is playing an important support role in the consultation and development of the national plan, which will be published by the end of this year and will cover the period from 2013 until 2018.  It is intended to publish the report on the consultation alongside the publication of the plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100031#GG01000","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1380644700,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed response.

This is a voluntary group that operates in Gort and which carries out undoubtedly invaluable work for cancer sufferers in that area.  The service supplies drivers to bring cancer sufferers to and from hospital on a daily basis if needs be and whenever they need treatment.  I understand that up to 60 people in any one month could avail of the service.  I was very impressed in my engagement with those on the committee and the work they have been doing.  They raised several issues with me, including this issue, which I believe merits some national attention.<\/p><p>Cancer patients who have been diagnosed with cancer endure undue financial hardship as a consequence of their illness.  We are all in agreement with that.  I know several people who have been afflicted with this illness who were self-employed with children and without private health insurance yet were not eligible for a medical card.  There is no doubt this situation has left them in a completely vulnerable position financially.  Only for the involvement of their own family members who helped them to manage basic expenses such as heating and travel to and from hospital for treatment, they would have been left in a precarious financial situation.  This is a degrading situation for anyone to find themselves in.  It is bad enough to be diagnosed with this illness and having to concentrate on recovering from it, but worrying about the requisite health cover too is unfair on these people.  Without the type of support from groups in my area such as Athenry Cancer Care, Gort Cancer Support, Galway Hospice Foundation and Cancer Care West, which have been known to assist sufferers with financials in the aftermath of their hospitalisation, these people would be at a loss.  I believe the Irish Cancer Society financial aid scheme provides more than &euro;1 million per year to cancer patients who need financial help in the aftermath of hospitalisation and this figure has grown in 2013.<\/p><p>Groups like these are overextended at present given the reduction in the number of people who are voluntarily donating to their causes as a result of the recession.  People who are suffering from cancer worry a good deal about the cost of having the illness and it is a sad reflection of this situation that they must endure it.  They need to focus on recuperating, that is the first priority.  I realise several cancer sufferers have medical cards granted by the Government and they do not need the same level of attention.  However, there are others who have fallen through the net.<\/p><p>When one of my constituents became aware that I was bringing up this issue today on the Adjournment, she spoke to me in respect of her husband who has Huntington's disease.  I am unsure if the Minister of State is familiar with the situation with this disease but there is no cure for it and those who have it are terminally ill.  She mentioned to me that several people she knows who are afflicted with the illness have been refused medical cards in the recent past.<\/p><p>While we need better health for everyone in every community I am compelled to ask the Minister of State to deliver on some improvements in this area to help with the medical and financial experiences of the many thousands of individuals who are availing of cancer health services every day as well as those suffering from Huntington's disease.  I acknowledge the Minister of State is in a very difficult financial position as a result of the mess that we inherited from the last Government but I call on him and his Department to consider it, even if it is not something that can be granted immediately, that it would be something that would register on the radar and that may be provided within the term of this Government across the board to all cancer sufferers and people suffering from Huntington's disease.

The Minister of State will be aware that when a person is diagnosed, the word \"cancer\" drives terror into the hearts of people and often they are fearful that they will be unable to be provided with the medication necessary to help them to overcome this terrible illness.  It is a great concern for people.<\/p><p>The guidelines for medical cards are so low that people on an average industrial wage or low-income families do not qualify unless they have a mortgage to offset it.

In the Minister of State's reply to me at the time he stated that there were many other illnesses that would have to be considered as well if we considered cancer.  However, many of the very bad illnesses are considered long term and those suffering have a long-term illness card whereas cancer sufferers do not.

People with specific illnesses such as cancer are not automatically entitled to medical cards.  This has been the legal position since 1970.  It is not possible for the Minister for Health or any Minister to issue a directive to change that position.  There would have to be new legislation passed by the Oireachtas because this is the law passed by the Oireachtas in 1970.  The basis for obtaining a medical card is on foot of an assessment of a person's means.  That is what the law provides.  I understand the point Senator Moloney made but it is not something that is amenable to being changed by ministerial directive.  It could not be done by ministerial directive because the Act of 1970 would have to be amended.<\/p><p>Having said that, the HSE has discretion to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines.  The discretion must be exercised by the HSE but the fundamental provision in the 1970 Act is that a person is assessed on the basis of his means.  The question asked is whether the person can provide for his own health care and treatment without undue hardship.  The opportunity for the exercise of discretion is in place to deal with the types of cases raised by Senators Moloney and Higgins, that is, people who are above the income limits but who still face genuine hardship in terms of providing for themselves.  It still cannot be done on the basis of someone having an illness.<\/p><p>I am always mindful of how harsh it sounds for a Minister to say that we do not give medical cards to people simply on the basis of an illness.  It is a hard and crude way of answering the question.  However, I am simply setting out for the benefit of the House what the law provides.  There is no basis for extending a medical card to a citizen on the basis of his having a particular illness.  That is not the current state of the law and if we were to change it, it would have to be done by legislation.<\/p><p>The Government has a commitment set out in the programme for Government for universal access to a free general practitioner service.  I accept this is not the full General Medical Services, GMS, scheme but it is a free GP service for the entire population.  This is for the entire population; whether they are well or ill we want everyone to have access to a free GP service.  The aim is to develop primary care and do all the things in primary care that we need to do in this country in terms of identifying the area of health care which is closest to where a person lives and where they are.  They should be treated there and should have available to them treatment in the community.  We should have available all the preventative strategies that we need to have in the health service that have not been sufficiently well-developed.  The idea is to involve and assist people and encourage people across the board not only when they are ill, although obviously that is the most sensitive and difficult time.<\/p><p>I do not take from anything that the Senators have said and what Senator Moloney said may be true in terms of the guidelines being so low.  However, fully 43% of the population satisfy the guidelines.  Medical cards have been extended to 43% of the entire population.  That is a statement of how incomes have been affected generally as a result of the recession because so many among the population can satisfy what Senator Moloney has described as low figures.  It reflects the situation in which the country finds itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100032#HH00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1380645300,"counter":237,"content":"<p>It is nothing to be proud of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100032#HH00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1380645300,"counter":238,"content":"<p>No, absolutely not, on the contrary.  In respect of medical cards extended on a discretionary basis, social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  This applies even where the person is above the income guidelines and the person can apply to be dealt with under the discretion which is available to be exercised.  That discretion is applied automatically during the processing of the application where additional information has been provided which can be considered by staff or a medical officer, where appropriate.<\/p><p>At the request of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, the HSE has set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for a discretionary medical card where a person exceeds income guidelines but where there are difficult personal circumstances such as an illness.<\/p> <p>The community medical officer reviews and interprets medical information provided by the applicant on a confidential basis.  He or she then liaises with general practitioners, hospital consultants and other health professionals, as appropriate, to determine the health needs of the applicant and his or her family and dependants.  The community medical officer then applies discretion within the guidelines to determine if the applicant is suffering from medical hardship.  It is important to stress the medical card system is founded on the undue hardship test.  The Health Act 1970 provides for medical cards on the basis of means.  As I have indicated, this is what the law states and no Minister can go outside the legal parameters that are set out.  One could best describe the discretionary system as being an exception to the general rule that one must satisfy the income limits.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive, HSE, also has a system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details.  With the exception of terminally ill patients in palliative care, all emergency cards are issued for six months on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  Where a patient is terminally ill in palliative care, the nature of the terminal illness is not a deciding factor in the issue of an emergency medical card in these circumstances and no means test applies.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure the person gets the card as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100032#HH00500","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380645900,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed response and welcome everything he is doing in respect of the provision of discretionary medical cards to those who are in need.

Members will recall the programme for Government included a plan to extend general practitioner visiting cards to the population that was to start with people with long-term illnesses and was then to move on to those who needed high technology drugs.  I should note that when considering this plan earlier this year, the Government ran into huge legal obstacles regarding the definition of illnesses.  I acknowledge that sounds strange and one might ask how it could be difficult to define an illness, but I assure Members it is not as straightforward as it sounds to draft primary legislation defining a particular illness, even a long-term illness, and then the statutory regulations to be drawn up by a Minister providing diagnostic guidance as to when a person is to be deemed to have a particular illness or otherwise.  While I do not try to put unnecessary obstacles in the way of the Senator's proposals, the matter is not so straightforward.  While there may be a case for doing this, it would change completely the scheme of the basic legislation, which is to help people on the basis of a problem with their means rather than a particular illness.

I note the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, has organised similar meetings throughout the State.  A strong sense of solidarity was evident at the meeting, at which parents showed solidarity with teachers, and there was solidarity between small and large schools as well as between urban and rural schools.  All were united in their anger towards the cuts experienced in education, not just over the past two years but over the past six years and six budgets.  The figures presented to the meeting revealed one of the lowest levels of investment in education in terms of the ratio between education expenditure and gross domestic product, GDP, as well as that the State has the second highest class sizes in the European Union.  Moreover, the fact that 121,353 children in the State are in class sizes of more than 30, including one in four children in schools in Waterford city and county, came as no surprise to the parents in the audience who came to voice their anger and frustration at Government policies.<\/p><p>It also was interesting that only one of the four Deputies representing Waterford turned up to the public meeting, namely, Deputy Ciara Conway of the Labour Party.  I commended her on her courage in attending the meeting to face teachers and to listen to the pupils.  However, she said a number of interesting things.  She asked the teachers and the parents to lobby the Government for the introduction of a wealth tax and for the introduction of higher rates of tax on high income earners who earn more than &euro;100,000.  This is the same argument Sinn F&eacute;in will make to the Government when presenting its alternative budget.  There was a strong sense in the room last night among teachers and parents that while there is no easy way to solve the economic crisis we face, there is a fairer way and asking children to pay the price through cutbacks in education is not the way to do this at a time when there are options, such as those outlined by Deputy Conway to the meeting yesterday, that could be considered by the Government and which would be supported by my party were they to be introduced.<\/p><p>It is appalling that in 21st century Ireland, a country that promised to cherish all the children of the nation equally, so many children are in so-called &quot;super-classes&quot;.  All the research and data show that educational outcomes are affected by class size.  I spoke to many of the teachers afterwards and they spoke of the diverse range of pupils now in the classrooms, from new immigrants to people with special needs or intellectual disabilities.  The teachers must manage such diversity in their classrooms in very difficult circumstances in which the school population is growing at a time when an embargo prevents the employment of new teachers.  This means bigger class sizes, which is having an impact on the educational outcomes of children.  The meeting heard from the parents of children with special needs, including one parent whose child has an intellectual disability and has been obliged to leave mainstream education because of the cutbacks in the school.  The meeting heard simple demands from the INTO, which has proposed marrying general allocation hours with resource hours to make it easier for schools to manage.  This is a simple demand made of the Government that is not being met.  While it is not all about money, obviously the cutbacks are having an impact and the most frustrating points to emerge from the meeting yesterday were the lack of engagement from those Oireachtas Members who were not present and the lack of belief that the Government is listening.  It is disappointing that the Minister himself is not responding to this Adjournment matter today.<\/p><p>All I can do is to take to the Minister of State the strong concerns and high level of anger that were articulated by both parents and teachers at last night's meeting in Waterford.  I appeal to her that education would not be cut again in the forthcoming budget and that the alternative options for increased taxation that were supported by her colleague from Waterford, Deputy Conway, at last night's meeting would be considered.  I appeal to the Government to put in place the fairer choices and options that are open to it and to not cut funding to education, including primary and secondary school education for children, in the forthcoming budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100033#JJ00700","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1380645900,"counter":246,"content":"<p>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, who unfortunately cannot be present, I thank Senator Cullinane for giving me the opportunity to outline to this House the position regarding staffing in primary schools.  The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools are published annually on the Department's website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the national staffing schedule for the relevant school year and the specific pupil enrolment in the school in question on 30 September of the previous year.  The staffing schedule sets out in a fair and transparent manner the pupil thresholds for the allocation of mainstream classroom posts for all schools and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location.<\/p> <p>It currently operates on the basis of a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS band 1 schools.  These arrangements include the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment based on that for 30 September of the coming school year.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, circular 0013\/2013.  This Government protected front-line services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the 2013 budget and consequently there was no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools for the 2013-14 school year.  The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of that budget.<\/p><p>The budget for education, including the number of teaching posts we can afford to fund in schools, is a matter the Minister for Education and Skills will have to consider with colleagues in Cabinet in the context of the forthcoming budget.  The context for any discussion about class sizes is that the Department Education and Skills , like all Departments, is operating within a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis.  The decisions in regard to such matters will be announced at budget time.  The Minister's focus is on ensuring we have school places and teachers for the thousands of additional pupils entering our schools each year.  There is no scope to give any consideration to the provision of additional teachers in order to reduce class sizes - anybody who suggests otherwise is not operating in the real world.  While difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across the Department's budget, the Government will endeavour to protect front-line education services as best as possible.  However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure into line with what we can afford as a country.  The challenge will be to ensure that the resources which can be provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcome for pupils.<\/p><p>Government decisions on reductions in resources in any area are not taken lightly nor are they taken in isolation from the likely impact.  The key challenge is to do this while also improving outcomes.  We all have to achieve more with less.  Within the schools sector we know from international research that although class size is a factor, the quality of teaching is a far more significant factor in determining outcomes.  We therefore have to focus on the drivers of good performance.  We need to have the right people becoming teachers.  We need the right training for them in college and we need to support them with the right professional development throughout their career.  To this end we are making significant changes to both the structure and format of initial teacher education so that our colleges and teachers are comparable with the best in the world.<\/p><p>At school level we need to foster and develop a culture of self-evaluation.  In addition to supporting school self-evaluation, our school inspection system will continue to provide robust external evaluation of schools and promote improvement in quality and standards in teaching and learning.  This, along with targeted initiatives such as those for improving literacy and numeracy, will help to restore and improve our education system and improve the way it compares with our international competitors.<\/p><p>To reiterate, the Department of Education and Skills treats schools fairly and objectively in allocating resources to them.  This is done in a transparent manner using published criteria.  Teaching resources are allocated to schools on a school year basis.  Unlike most other areas of the public service, teaching vacancies are being filled in accordance with published Department criteria.  Within the constraints of the employment control framework schools are permitted to fill teaching vacancies that arise within their approved staffing allocations.  The day-to-day management of how teaching resources are used in schools is done at local school level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100033#JJ00800","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380646500,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for taking the Adjournment matter but I strongly object to the comment that those who suggest consideration be given to providing additional teachers in order to reduce class sizes do not live in the real world.

To say that parents and teachers who simply want acceptable class sizes in this State do not live in the real is appalling.  For them, the real world seems to be where no end of money is available to put into banks to pay back the sins of developers, bankers and speculators, but putting money into education cannot happen.

The development of wind farms is causing widespread public concern in rural areas, scaring communities and causing large divisions in many areas for which major proposals are being prepared.  The 2006 guidelines now in place on wind farm developments are totally out of date given that the height of wind turbines at the time was 50m to 60m.  The current proposals for turbines suggest heights of up to 180m or more.<\/p><p>  The adequacy of set-back distances from residential homes to safeguard against noise and shadow flicker is of particular concern to rural communities.  Shortly after wind turbines began to be erected close to housing, complaints emerged of adverse effects on health.  Sleep disturbance was the principal complaint.  These reports were commonly dismissed as subjective and anecdotal but there is now a growing body of medical and other evidence detailing these concerns.  In March 2012, for example,  the <i>British Medical Journal<\/i> published a peer-reviewed editorial on wind turbine noise.  The editorial is very clear about the health risks involved and calls for an independent review of existing evidence and guidance on acceptable noise levels.  It also calls on governments to ensure that the public will not suffer harm from the additional ambient noise that results from the inappropriate siting of turbines.  This information clearly confirms there now is a large body of evidence which suggests that wind turbines disturb sleep and impair health.  The Governments of Canada, the UK and Denmark have undertaken, or are undertaking, major policy changes to take effect of the health implications of wind turbines.<\/p><p>  The health impacts are not the only concern as the loss of landscape character and general amenity which form the cornerstone of the tourism industry in rural Ireland, most especially in areas like my county, Donegal, is a very sensitive issue in respect of wind turbine development.  The visual impact of such major developments in sensitive areas and environments can seriously undermine the local tourism product.  As we all know, growth in tourism has given substantial increase in employment in the past 18 months or so and the sector is showing signs of improvement. <\/p><p>  During the summer the Government began the process of carrying out a strategic environmental assessment nationally to identify areas suitable for the development of wind projects intended for the exporting of electricity.<\/p> <p>These are substantial international projects.  I am sure there has been collaboration between the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the issue.  Can the Minister provide information in respect of the criteria to be used for that assessment, who will conduct the surveys, the level of public consultation to be undertaken and if communities will be involved in the process?<\/p><p>Rural communities have had to acquire their own independent experts to interpret and evaluate applications made by multinational  millionaire developers and developments in the planning system.  As a result of their efforts, many of the developments approved by local authorities, through the planning process, have fallen short when scrutinised by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A prime example of this can be found in my constituency where the local community volunteers came together, at great cost to themselves, and objected to a planning application approved by Donegal County Council.  Eventually they won, as did openness and transparency but at great financial cost to the individuals concerned.  I pay tribute to those individuals.<\/p><p>The level of competency and assessment in these applications is seriously in question particularly in terms of how noise impact is assessed and EU directives on the environment have not been adhered to.  The European Court of Justice has made a number of rulings against Ireland relating to the country's failure to implement environmental directives and the environmental impact assessment directive which governs these applications.  Rural communities are entitled to expect that the Government will make provision in planning guidelines for wind farms for their protective well-being and consideration of the societal impact in terms of socio-economic factors, tourism, cohesiveness of communities and the attractiveness of the areas in which they live.<\/p><p>Development such as wind farms have the potential to seriously undermine the substantive basis of which these rural communities survive and prosper.  There remains a fundamental absence of transparency governing these developments.  There is an absence of consultation with local residents and local communities and above all, there is an absence of a legislative framework to deal with the step-change in technology and scale of developments currently being processed and developed throughout the country by multinational and multimillionaire developers.<\/p><p>The Government must provide for proper public consultation for communities to have their voice heard and concerns addressed on the changes being proposed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources through the SEA assessment.  This is also a planning issue which is governed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Given that widespread concern has been expressed throughout the country by communities in Donegal, the midlands and other parts I call on the Minister to initiate a process in the Department of the Environment where a moratorium would be introduced immediately banning each local authority from granting planning permission to any wind farm development until such time as new and up-to-date guidelines are in place, taking cognisance of the British Medical Journal report.  The governments of Canada, the UK and Denmark have undertaken to update their legislative frameworks given the health implications for local communities.  We must protect the interests of local communities over multibillionaire developers.  It is time we stood up for the communities represented in the House and not international interests who come here only to reap the financial gains which they can make from such development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100034#KK00400","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380647100,"counter":253,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.<\/p><p>The development of renewables, including wind energy, is at the heart of this Government's energy policy.  The availability of indigenous, sustainable power is a valuable national asset and is vital for achieving energy security, emissions reductions and economic renewal through job creation.  The construction of wind farms is subject to the planning code in the same manner as other developments.  Local authority development plans are required to achieve a balance in harnessing the wind energy resources of the planning authority's area in a manner that is consistent with proper planning and sustainable development.  Planning authorities must have regard to my Department's wind energy development guidelines, which were published in June 2006.  They provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy through the development plan and development management processes.  The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.<\/p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and other stakeholders, is now undertaking a targeted review of the wind energy guidelines 2006 focusing on noise, proximity and shadow flicker.  As part of this process, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has commissioned a study to examine the significance of noise related to onshore wind farms.<\/p><p>I wish to clarify that it is not the Government's intention to develop a new legislative framework to govern wind farm developments.  The existing wind energy guidelines have served us well and what is intended is a targeted review of aforementioned issues in order to update the guidelines.  In this context and given the existing guidelines, it is not necessary nor is it proposed to suspend the granting of planning permissions for wind farm developments.  The indicative timetable for the publication of the draft guidelines is quarter 4 of 2013.  The draft guidelines will, like all other new or revised guidelines, go out for extensive public consultation for a period of six weeks to two months, to allow for publication of the final guidelines in 2014.  Once the consultation period is closed, the submissions received on the draft guidelines will be considered and taken into account in the final form of the guidelines.<\/p><p>Given that many people are raising the issue of large companies exporting wind energy, etc., I wish to clarify that there are two types of wind projects currently being progressed - those for contribution to our domestic targets and those for export to the United Kingdom.

The framework will be prepared over the coming year and will provide an opportunity for all stakeholders including local authorities, potential project developers and local communities to be consulted and have an input into the national policy for wind export.<\/p><p>It is clear from what I have said that there is a long process involved in the export projects and three hooks have to be jumped before getting into the process.

There is also a need for a national debate.<\/p><p>While I am a proponent and supporter of wind energy we must have a debate on the effectiveness and efficiency of wind energy.  As international reports suggest that only 25% of the power capacity of a wind turbine is developed, so what happens with the other 75%?  We have to look at the grant aid available for the industry.  From where does the money come and the EU grants which are being pumped into these developments by European and Irish taxpayers?  Those questions need to be addressed as part of the public consultation process.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that is part of the overall package and not to rule out the possibility of a legislative framework instead of just guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013100100035#LL00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1380647100,"counter":255,"content":"<p>One of the reasons we consider legislation is not appropriate is that the technology and scientific knowledge is changing so quickly.  The reason the guidelines need to be reviewed is because technology has changed.  Masts are higher and a lot of elements of the technology have changed.
