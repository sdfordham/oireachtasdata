I want to ensure that existing GP services are retained and that general practice remains an attractive career option for newly-qualified GPs. <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the important role that GPs play in our health service and I recognise the commitment of GPs to ensuring a responsive, accessible and high-quality service to patients. The number of GPs on the specialist register continues to increase &ndash; up from 2,270 in 2010 to 3,668 as of 18 May 2018 and there are now 2,491 GPs contracted by the HSE under the GMS scheme compared to 2,098 in 2008. It should be noted that as of 1st March there were only 23 GMS panels that do not have a permanent GP in place &ndash; a vacancy rate of less than 1%.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past 6 years, an average of 143 GPs per year entered the GMS scheme compared with an average of 111 GPs per year exiting the scheme for the same period. During 2016 and 2017, an average of 158 GPs per year entered the GMS Scheme compared with an average of 132 GPs per year exiting the scheme for the same period. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the manpower issues facing general practice and has taken steps to increase the number of GP training places. In 2009, there were 120 General Practice training places available and this year it is expected that over 190 training places will be filled, an increase of around 60% over a nine year period. We will continue to work to improve the recruitment and retention in general practice in the coming years. Our objective is to achieve further increases in the number of GP training places in future years, and to ensure that all the available places are filled, in order to meet the future manpower needs of general practice. <\/p>  <p>  Other efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practicing GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday. An enhanced supports package for rural practices has also been introduced which includes improved qualifying criteria for rural support and an increase in the financial allowance from &euro;16,216 to &euro;20,000 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to engaging with GP representatives on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the current GMS contract which will benefit patients and also prove attractive to GPs.\u00a0The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.\u00a0There is potential for Government expenditure on general practice to increase significantly in coming years if the consultations are successful. Officials from my Department and the HSE met with the Irish Medical Organisation earlier this month in order to progress this agenda.\u00a0Consultations with the National Association of General Practitioners are also planned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900065#WRA04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Screening Programmes","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900065#WRA04200"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[23451\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900065#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of calls that have been made to the CervicalCheck helpline; the number that have been returned; the number that are awaiting a return call; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>As at 24 May 21,228 calls had been received by the CervicalCheck helpline, 11,341 women had requested callbacks and 10.382 women had received callbacks.\u00a0The rate of call back has been steadily improving and as of 24 May stood at 92 per cent.

However, over 20,000 patients did not attend their appointments last year. <\/p>  <p>  Tallaght University Hospital has advised that\u00a0it has\u00a0undertaken a number of actions to address the issue of long outpatient appointment waiting times. This includes the a 'see and treat' initiative  for same-day minor procedures and\u00a0the recruitment of additional consultants in ENT, orthopaedics and neurology. The hospital further advises\u00a0it is\u00a0working closely with the Acute Hospital Division of the HSE and with the NTPF to identify additional resources required to assist\u00a0a reduction in\u00a0waiting lists, including a joint initiative with local GPs on new patient pathways. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE\u00a0is working with the NTPF and my Department to finalise a joint plan focused on improving overall use of resources to tackle long patient waiting times and ensuring timely access to treatment and care for our patients.

In this regard, they have committed to developing a strategic five year framework to support multi-annual planning for residential care services and community supports to include day, respite, personal assistant, home support services as well as therapeutic interventions taking account of national database projections and the need to develop sustainable models of service which achieve HIQA compliance within approved timeframes.\u00a0 <\/p><p>To meet the challenges arising from the increase in the number of people living with disability, the increase in age and life expectancy both of the person with the disability and their carer and the changing needs of people with a disability, collaborative working is required across the wider health and social care setting with the aim of improving access to services for all people with disability.  It is important to recognise that the needs of people with a disability extend well beyond health service provision, and the health service will participate fully with other governmental departments and services in the development of cross-sectoral strategies to maximise access to services and supports for people with disabilities.\u00a0 <\/p><p>My Department also provides funding through the Health Research Board, for the intellectual Disability Supplement to The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing.<\/p><p>IDS-TILDA is a longitudinal study researching ageing in Ireland among people with an intellectual disability aged 40 and over.  This study is the first of its kind in Europe, and the only study able to directly compare the ageing of people with intellectual disability with the general ageing population.<\/p><p>The underpinning values of IDS-TILDA are inclusion, choice, empowerment, person centred, the promotion of people with intellectual disability, the promotion of best practice and to make a contribution to the lives of people with intellectual disability.<\/p><p>The recently published Wave 3 IDS-TILDA report marked the 10-year anniversary of IDS-TILDA and captured how much has changed in Ireland, \u00a0over those 10 years in the lives of people ageing with an intellectual disability.  Thanks to IDS-TILDA, more is known today about the lives of people with an intellectual disability as they age.<\/p><p>Further details are available from IDS-TILDA at <i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[23507\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the implementation of the recommendations of the external independent clinical review of maternity services at Portiuncula Hospital.","asker":"1231","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>I would like to convey my sympathies to the families involved and welcome the completion of this review process for them.<\/p><p>The HSE has advised me that Portiuncula University Hospital and Saolta University Health Care Group have reviewed the findings and recommendations in the report.\u00a0 An Implementation Team is already in place to progress the recommendations.\u00a0I particularly welcome the fact that the team includes input from some of the families affected. <\/p><p>I am also assured that a significant number of actions are already underway which will advance the implementation of the recommendations.<\/p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Assessments Waiting Times","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[23446\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE's waiting times for assessment of need for children with disabilities will be addressed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.\u00a0 If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with their HSE Local Health Office, who will investigate the complaint.<\/p>  <p>  If the local office determines that the charge was inappropriate, it will inform the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service who will arrange to refund the cost of the blood test to patient and recoup this amount from the GP.  The local office will inform the GP of the decision to deduct the payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":232,"content":"<p>Question No. 123 answered with Question No. 60.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[23560\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the timeframe for bringing the child and adolescent mental health services in CHO1 to the level envisaged in A Vision for Change.","asker":"1289","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":235,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services Provision","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[23455\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the HSE's policy in relation to the provision of out of hours emergency scan services for pregnant women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD05000"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[23459\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the new 50 bed mental health unit will open at GUH; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Dementia Strategy Implementation","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD05300"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[23510\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>The National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014, and seeks to increase awareness and understanding of dementia, ensure earlier diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community based supports and services.  It was created to meet the challenges faced by the 55,000 people living with dementia in Ireland and to provide a network of services that will meet growing demand in future years.  The number of people with dementia is expected to almost treble by 2046.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy identified 35 priority and additional actions to be implemented over its lifetime.  Of these 35 actions, one has been fully implemented.\u00a0Substantial work has been completed on 16 others, while preliminary work has been conducted on a\u00a0further 17.  One action has suffered from significant delays because there\u00a0is a number of pending legislative streams which are impacting on the progression of this action.<\/p>  <p>  Work is underway on the vast majority of actions.  Due to the lack of reliable national data on dementia care services in Ireland, much of this work has focused on collecting baseline information on current dementia service structures, to generate an evidence base for the development of services.  This work is necessary in order to ensure that the development of national dementia services meets the identified needs of people with dementia, their families and carers, while also integrating with existing structures and services.<\/p>  <p>  Priority actions, which received funding from the HSE and grants from the Atlantic Philanthropies, have included the establishment of a National Dementia Office within the HSE, which is responsible for\u00a0overseeing the implementation of the Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The PREPARED programme\u00a0offers GPs and Primary Care Teams upskilling and training to diagnose and manage dementia. It will also map local services and supports.<\/p>  <p>  The Dementia: Understand Together has been working with individuals, businesses, organisations and communities to take steps in creating inclusive and supportive environments for people with dementia.  Radio and television advertisements have featured prominently, and\u00a0continue to play a role in combatting the stigma and social isolation that a diagnosis of dementia often\u00a0causes.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising that many people with dementia wish to continue living in their own homes and communities, and that flexible, person-centred services are an integral component of supporting people to remain at home, dementia specific intensive home care packages have been introduced to assist people with dementia who have complex needs.  Funding which had been granted by Atlantic for the first three years has been replaced by resources from the HSE.  At the end of April, 316 people had benefitted from a package, with 147 active at that point.  The HSE has committed to continue funding the delivery of intensive home care packages to people with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  A number of additional actions within the National Dementia Strategy are being addressed.  Funding for these actions has been secured through the Dormant Accounts Fund, with the Department securing &euro;2.28 million through the 2016 and 2017 Action Plans. These projects include a dementia diagnostic programme,\u00a0a post-diagnostic support pathway, the development of a network of memory technology resource rooms, the mapping of dementia specific community based services, and the creation of a dementia registry.<\/p>  <p>  On Wednesday 23rd May, a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy was launched, fulfilling a commitment made by the Department.  This Review provides an overview of work completed to date and work ongoing for each action identified in the Strategy.  Also contained is an action plan for the work of the National Dementia Office over the next 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  A large scale external evaluation of the Strategy is currently being conducted, with the aim of detailing the level of success in improving the dementia care system and the extent to which programmes and activities have impacted on people with dementia and their families and carers.  The results of this external evaluation will be available during Q1 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is committed to the full implementation of the National Dementia Strategy, and will continue to co-operate with the National Dementia Office and stakeholders in progressing actions contained in the Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  This is an area that I am very conscious of and recognise that it needs more focus to deliver on the full strategy. I am also conscious that dementia is becoming a condition that affects more and more families across the country.  I have already had high level meetings with my officials and the HSE to discuss further deliverables in the context of the estimates for budget 2019 and I hope to be able progress new measures at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Facilities","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD05600"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[23453\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for a new neuro interventional angiography suite at Beaumont Hospital; if there is a contingency plan should the suite cease to operate suddenly; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900068#WRD05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900069#WRE00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900069#WRE00200"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[23421\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900069#WRE00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the Heads of Government and State he plans to meet in the next threemonths.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>A number of engagements are being planned with my EU and international counterparts over the coming months.<\/p><p>Yesterday, I hosted a meeting with <font color=\"#0000FF\">t<\/font>he Prime Minister of South Korea, Lee Nak-yeon, here in Dublin<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>and last week, I hosted the Belgian Prime Minister, Charles Michel.

This includes the rights and equality provisions of the Good Friday Agreement which are central to the Peace Process.<\/p>  <p>  Our EU partners, including the Commission Taskforce, have shown solidarity and support in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns, including the protection of the Agreement.  On 8 December last, a Joint Report between the EU and UK negotiators was agreed which included important commitments in respect of protecting the Agreement in all its parts.  The draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which forms part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, translates these commitments into a legal framework.<\/p>  <p>  Article 1 of the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland provides that the UK will ensure that there is no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Chapter of the Good Friday Agreement on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity, resulting from the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.  The Protocol also proposes that the UK would ensure no diminution in the area of protection against discrimination as enshrined in the provisions of EU law to be set out in Annex 1 to the Protocol.  These commitments will be implemented through a dedicated mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  On the question of the content of Annex 1 and the operation of the dedicated mechanism, work is ongoing in this regard, as provided for in the December Joint Report.  The Government&rsquo;s aim is to secure a result which affords the greatest possible protection for rights in Northern Ireland following the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the &ldquo;no diminution&rdquo; commitment, the Protocol also importantly proposes that the UK would facilitate the related work of the institutions and bodies of the Good Friday Agreement, which includes the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, and the Joint Committee of both the Human Rights Commissions in both jurisdictions.  The Protocol also clearly acknowledges that the people of Northern Ireland who choose to identify as Irish, and therefore as EU citizens, will continue to enjoy rights, opportunities and benefits of EU citizenship.<\/p>  <p>  More work is required between the UK and EU on rights and equality issues, as is provided for in the Joint Report.  The Government will continue to engage intensively on these issues, working with our EU partners and the Commission Taskforce and the UK, to ensure that the commitments made to date are delivered on in full.  In this regard, maintaining frequent contact with our EU partners, including the Commission Taskforce, has been a priority for Ireland throughout the Article 50 negotiation process.  Officials from my Department, in particular from the Permanent Representation in Brussels, have very regular, almost daily, engagement with the Commission Taskforce, including on issues relating to rights and the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900069#WRE03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Good Friday Agreement","counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900069#WRE03900"},{"type":"question","counter":284,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[23243\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900069#WRE04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way in which he plans to ensure that outstanding commitments from the Good Friday Agreement are brought forward in the context of securing an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.","asker":"1258","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":285,"content":"<p>Protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts and the gains of the peace process is at the forefront of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the Brexit negotiations.

Where a credit union wishes to provide services to its members, other than those services that are provided for under the 1997 Act or the list of services exempt from the additional services requirements set out in the 2016 Regulations, an application may be made to the Central Bank for approval to provide such additional services, in accordance with the provisions in sections 48-52 of the 1997 Act.<\/p><p>Debit card provision is subject to formal application and approval by the Central Bank, whether it be direct provision or distribution of third party debit cards under sections 48 and 49 of the Credit Union Act. <\/p><p>There is currently a fully defined current account service including debit card, Members Personal Current Account Services (MPCAS) which is available to eligible credit unions as an additional service.  The current eligibility criteria include a suggested minimum asset size of &euro;75 million, reflecting the need for significant initial investment in start up initiatives of this nature.  This also recognises the importance of transaction volume necessary for scale discounts which requires the participation of larger credit unions.  The business of providing payment service instruments such as debit cards on current accounts is a complex, sophisticated and regulated business activity requiring a distinct business model and associated risk management capabilities and capacities.  Furthermore, the provision of such services requires on-going investment, volume pricing and access to technical expertise which given typical credit union size is likely to require a shared service model.

FWT is a 20% withholding tax that applies for certain payments to non-resident artistes.   FWT only applies to non-resident artistes, who are resident outside the EU\/EEA and who are engaged by companies qualifying for the film tax credit under section 481 TCA.  It does not apply to support staff such as cameramen, producers, directors etc.<\/p>  <p>  The FWT cannot apply to other artistes such as international music artistes who perform concerts in the State.  I am informed by Revenue that there are no specific tax exemptions available to international artistes performing in the State.  Artistes who are not resident in the State for tax purposes have a liability to Irish tax on income arising from the exercise of their profession in the State.  However, because foreign resident artistes merely have a transitory presence in the State, there are numerous practical difficulties associated with enforcing such a liability.  Where non-resident entertainers do not file an Irish tax return, there is no effective mechanism to quantify the potential tax exposure of such entertainers on the income related to their Irish performances and to collect any tax owing.  However, an alternative system which would impose an obligation on paying agents to deduct tax from payments made to foreign entertainers and account for the tax to Revenue, would also present many difficulties such as the requirement to identify the paying agent, in order to enforce collection, as well as placing a costly compliance burden, both on Revenue and the non-resident artistes and paying agents.  Imposing tax therefore would be administratively cumbersome relative to the potentially small prospective yield and would also undoubtedly discourage some artistes from performing in the State.<\/p>  <p>  I can however advise the Deputy that in general where a concert takes place in Ireland, the artistes performance fee is subject to Irish VAT.  Where an international performer is engaged by a promoter, it is the responsibility of the promoter to account for the VAT due on the performance fee.  This means that where the promoter is established in Ireland, the promoter is required to account for Irish VAT on the performance fee. In circumstances where the artiste and promoter are both established outside the State, the promoter is required to account for VAT on the performance fee where she\/he is established.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, where a premises provider allows a promoter who is not established in the State to hold a concert on their premises, the provider must report details of the event to Revenue.  Failure to do so can make the premises provider jointly liable for any VAT arising.  This is a safeguard provision to ensure the correct VAT is collected and paid in relation to any merchandise sold at the concert venue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900070#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Resolution Processes","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900070#WRF02900"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[23139\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900070#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the definition of a non-performing loan, NPL, in the context of buy-to-let mortgages; if such a loan can be deemed to be an NPL if the terms of an agreement have been honoured for a number of years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>The definition of a non-performing buy to let loan is the same as that of any other credit exposure and applies to exposures which are more than 90 days past-due; and\/or the borrower is assessed as unlikely to pay their credit obligations in full without realisation of collateral, regardless of the existence of any past-due amount or of the number of days past due.<\/p><p>In relation to the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, the classification as non-performing depends on the particular circumstances of each individual loan, and is subject to internal assessment by each bank and review by that bank&rsquo;s external auditor.

An\u00a0additional provision to give effect to this decision is being included in the Insurance (Amendment) Bill, which has now been finalised by my officials in liaison with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.  I expect to bring this Bill to Government for approval to publish shortly.  I am hoping that, with the cooperation of Members of the House, the Bill will\u00a0pass all Stages in an efficient manner.  Once enacted, it will allow for the payment of 100% of the compensation due to Setanta third party motor insurance claimants including the additional 35% to those who have\u00a0settled their claims and have already received compensation of 65% of their claim subject to the limit outlined above.<\/p>  <p>  To date, there have been three applications to the High Court for payment of compensation from the ICF in relation to Setanta Insurance.  Orders were granted in the High Court on 11 May 2018, 24 July 2017 and 15 November 2016. The total amount paid out of the ICF on foot of these orders is &euro;14.6 million being 65% of the total value of the settled claims.<\/p>  <p>  The liquidator for Setanta Insurance has informed me that as no settled claims have yet been paid in full, there remain 1,577 active claims of which 826 claimants have been paid compensation from the ICF subject to the 65%\/&euro;825,000 limits.  A further 117 claimants have settled their claims since the last tranche was submitted to the State Claims Agency for verification.  These claims will be included in the next application to the High Court and are to the value of &euro;5.1 million being 100% of the total value of the settled claims. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, there are 645 claimants whose personal injuries claims (some of who also have damage claims) have not yet been settled and a further 223 claimants whose damage only claims have not yet been settled. In the case of the numbers of claimants, there may be more than one claimant associated with each claim. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that only claims which have been settled can be included in an application to the High Court for payment from the ICF.  The process of settling claims is still ongoing and it is hoped that my decision to compensate third party claimants in full will continue to facilitate and accelerate this process.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the value of claims outstanding it is not possible to answer this question as these claims have not been settled, however as you know, the Liquidator commissioned actuarial consultants, Willis Towers Watson, to carry out an analysis of Setanta Insurance's claims reserves as at 30 June 2017.  The report estimates the claims reserves at between &euro;105.9 million and &euro;112.9 million. <\/p>  <p>  A consequence of this is that based on this actuarial report, the liquidator now estimates that he will not be in a position to meet more than 22% of the claims out of the assets of the liquidation once all matters in the liquidation have been concluded, rather than the not more\u00a0than 30% of claims figure previously indicated.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900071#WRGGG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900071#WRGGG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":356,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[23205\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900071#WRGGG00900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the tax exempt status of Irish pension funds that acquire property directly with no tax on the rental income of the pension fund and no capital gains tax were the pension to sell the property and make a gain.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[23206\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900071#WRGGG01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the tax neutral status of a company's (details supplied) rental income from the 262 apartments which it recently purchased in Churchtown, Dublin, due to the fact it is a pension and regulated fund, therefore exempt from dividend withholding tax under the Irish real estate fund regime.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that income from investments - including rental income on property investments &ndash; made by approved pension funds is exempt from income tax by virtue of section 774(3) Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA).\u00a0 Section 608(2) TCA grants exemption from capital gains tax on gains accruing on the disposal of investments, including property, held by pension funds approved under section 774 TCA.\u00a0 Benefits payable on or after retirement are taxable, subject to an entitlement to take a tax-free lump-sum.<\/p>  <p>  There are restrictions on how these reliefs and exemptions apply.\u00a0 For example, where a pension fund acquires property which is to be used in any business of the sponsoring employer or a connected person, or where it sells assets to the employer or a connected person, the assets in question are treated as a pension paid under the fund and are subject to tax and any amount treated as a pension payment is no longer regarded as a fund asset.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Irish Real Estate Funds (&ldquo;IREFs&rdquo;), these are investment undertakings that derive 25% or more of their value from Irish real estate.\u00a0 I am not in a position to comment on a specific case, but the following comments apply to any approved pension fund which holds units in an IREF.<\/p>  <p>  Pension fund providers utilise the funds received from their customers to invest, on their behalf, in a diverse portfolio of assets with a view to providing those customers with a pension upon their retirement. Pension fund providers may invest some funds in units in IREFs on behalf of their customers as a way of gaining exposure to a wider portfolio of Irish real estate than would otherwise be possible.\u00a0 In the case of smaller pension funds, it might not be possible to invest any funds in property if the entire property had to be acquired by the pension fund.  Accordingly the potential to invest in units in an IREF provides some pension funds with the ability to include an exposure to Irish real estate where otherwise this opportunity would not be available.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The legislation surrounding the operation of withholding tax on IREF taxable events is contained in section 739P of the Taxes Consolidation Act (&ldquo;TCA&rdquo;) 1997. The definition of a &lsquo;specified person&rsquo; for the purposes of section 739P TCA 1997 does not include a pension fund provided the IREF is in possession of a valid declaration from the pension fund in advance of the IREF taxable event.  If the pension fund provides a valid declaration to the IREF in advance of the IREF taxable event then the IREF will not operate withholding tax.<\/p>  <p>  Just as pension funds would not be subject to tax on profits or gains on Irish property if they held the property directly, they equally do not suffer IREF withholding tax where the exposure to Irish real estate is through such an investment vehicle.  Of course as with any pension fund the benefits are taxable on the pension holders upon their retirement irrespective of whether their funds were invested by the pension fund directly in Irish real estate or indirectly through units in an IREF. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900071#WRGGG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Real Estate Fund","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900071#WRGGG01200"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[23207\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900071#WRGGG01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the net receipts from dividend wildholding tax from the IREF regime in 2017 and to April 2018.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[23208\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900071#WRGGG01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the net receipts from dividend withholding tax from the REIT regime in 2017 and to April 2018.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[23209\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900071#WRGGG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated value of Irish real estate owned by REITs, IREFs and pension funds.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 to 171, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>In relation to 23207\/18, the Irish Real Estate Fund (IREF) regime was introduced by Finance Act 2016 and takes effect for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2017.

If the employee or former employee has only preferential loans from the bank then section 122(3) TCA 1997 applies to give rise to a tax liability on the full amount written off by the bank. \u00a0If there are a number of loans, including preferential loans, then, regardless of the order of the write off, the amount written off has to be first set against the amount of any preferential loan(s) outstanding and any tax liability arising on the preferential loan(s), so treated as written off first, has to be paid in accordance with section 122(3) TCA 1997.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900072#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900072#WRH01600"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[23430\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900072#WRH01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons that availed of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, per annum.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[23431\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900072#WRH01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to review the special assignee relief programme, SARP,; and his further plans to allow the partner of those that qualify for SARP to work.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[23432\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900072#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the way in which the special assignee relief programme, SARP, compares internationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 to 191, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The table sets out the number of claimants for the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) for each of the years 2012 to 2015, the most recent year for which figures are available:<table><tr><th>Year\u00a0 <\/th><th>Claimants<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>121<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>302<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>586<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that its SARP report for 2016 is likely to be published in June.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department formally reviewed SARP in 2014.

This Memorandum of Understanding sets out the principles of how the two organisations work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on completed flood relief schemes is provided to insurance companies to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability of insurance against the risk of flooding.  <\/p>  <p>  The Memorandum notes the requirement for insurance companies when assessing exposure to flood risk to take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed flood defence schemes.  Under this Memorandum of Understanding, Insurance Ireland provides the OPW with details of the level of policies that include flood risk insurance within the benefitting areas of these schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The initial tranche of data provided by the OPW to Insurance Ireland in 2014 covered twelve completed flood defence schemes; showing the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Details of a further five schemes were provided in January 2015 and details of the Waterford Flood Defence Scheme were shared last year. <\/p>  <p>  Since the initial tranche of data provided by the OPW, Insurance Ireland has completed four surveys of its members to assess the level of flood insurance in benefitting areas.  The most recent returns highlights that 83% of policies issued for residences and small businesses include flood risk insurance cover, with 90% of policies having flood cover in those areas protected by permanent flood defences.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Finance has responsibility for Government policy on flood insurance. In late 2016, the Minister for Finance prepared a report on policy options to support flood insurance.  This was considered by Government that agreed to continue with its policy of flood insurance cover being returned through Government investment in flood relief schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Memorandum the Department of Finance, Insurance Ireland and my officials meet with the insurance sector quarterly.  I am satisfied that in relation to the role of the OPW, my officials will continue to work with Insurance Ireland on this matter to ensure that the insurance industry has the required knowledge with regard to OPW flood defence schemes to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability of insurance against the risk of flooding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900074#WRK00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":491,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900074#WRK00600"},{"type":"question","counter":492,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[23679\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900074#WRK00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if parkland (details supplied) was disposed of by Dublin City Council to the OPW in 1986; when the disposal will be finalised; if the OPW will clean the area which is to the north west of the national monument; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":493,"content":"<p>It is my understanding that the area in question is currently still in the ownership of Dublin City Council and it is therefore a matter for the Council to clean and maintain this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900074#WRK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Industry","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900074#WRK00900"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[23705\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900074#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to establish a construction sector group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>The National Development Plan\u00a0contains a commitment to establish a Construction Sector Working Group.\u00a0 The purpose of the Group is to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector\u00a0to support\u00a0the successful delivery of the NDP on a value-for-money basis for the Exchequer. <\/p>  <p>  It is vital that the Group&rsquo;s remit is clear and speaks to the issues that require dialogue between Government and the sector.

The objective of the Working Group was to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of insurance, and recommend short, medium and longer term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs, taking account of the requirement for the need to ensure a financially stable insurance sector. <\/p>  <p>  A significant factor in the rising cost of insurance, identified in both the first and second reports of the Working Group (on (i) motor insurance and (ii)\u00a0employer's liability\/public liability respectively), is the impact of fraudulent insurance claims. As such, the reports include\u00a0a number of\u00a0recommendations relating to insurance fraud.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 25 of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance recommends the establishment of a fully functioning integrated insurance fraud database for industry to detect patterns of fraud.<\/p>  <p>  As recommendation lead, my Department\u00a0established a working group to progress the related action points.\u00a0The Group is made up of representatives from my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB), Insurance Ireland and the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland (MIBI). The Group has completed a report, which includes recommended parameters\u00a0for the database, who will be responsible for administering the database and disseminating data and how\u00a0the database\u00a0will be funded.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the Group was submitted to the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) and, in response, the ODPC has strongly endorsed the Group&rsquo;s view that detailed Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)\u00a0will be required in order to justify the potential addition of new datasets to the existing Insurance Link database, and the increased sharing of data. The ODPC also recommends that further work needs to be undertaken to detail the evidential requirements for the creation of a new database or the enhancement of the existing Insurance Link database.<\/p>  <p>  The application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) last week and the related data protection legislation, which I launched with Minister of State Breen in February this year, will have a significant impact on any new data sharing arrangements between industry members and between the industry and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As such,\u00a0the establishment of any new data sharing structures will require careful consideration against the changes to the legislative landscape. <\/p>  <p>  As a starting point, it is necessary for a review to be undertaken by the insurance industry of the information held on Insurance Link in the context of the GDPR. It is also necessary for the industry to assess in more detail what specific additional data is proposed to be shared and in what additional circumstances such data is proposed to be shared. It is essential that a critical balance is identified to ensure that data sharing between insurers is maximised while, at the same time, the data rights of the public are protected.\u00a0 Any changes, therefore, to the existing data-sharing arrangements for the purposes of Insurance Link must be proportional to their effect.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that Insurance Ireland expects to complete a detailed\u00a0DPIA in this regard by the end of August 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 26 of the same report relates to exploring the potential for further cooperation between the insurance sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to insurance fraud investigation. Specifically, this involves considering the feasibility of establishing a specialised and dedicated insurance fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, funded by industry.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) has engaged with Insurance Ireland, submitting a mechanism for further cooperation and a costed proposal to Insurance Ireland in the latter half of 2017. Insurance Ireland has agreed to explore the proposal further, subject to a full cost benefit analysis, to be carried out by Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Chief Financial Officers Working Group. The intention would be that such a dedicated Garda unit would be funded by Insurance Ireland members and non-members alike, i.e. all entities writing non-life insurance business in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Further progress on this recommendation is dependent upon the outcome of this cost benefit analysis, which is currently awaited. Insurance Ireland has indicated that it expects to be in a position to provide an update in this regard by the end of June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Any proposed agreed mechanism will, of course, ultimately be subject to the approval of the Garda Commissioner and myself, as Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendations 11 and 12 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance relate to the production of statistics relating to the number of complaints, investigations, prosecutions and convictions relating to fraud within the personal injuries area. My Department has liaised with the GNECB in relation to the production of these statistics, and I am informed that the necessary Pulse update is anticipated to be in place by the end of June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 13 of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance is aimed at developing a set of guidelines in respect of the reporting of suspected fraudulent insurance claims. The aim is to have a clear path to streamline the process of reporting suspected fraud and to ensure that complaints are received by the relevant sections in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 A &lsquo;Fraud Roundtable&rsquo; has been convened on a number of occasions to\u00a0work towards\u00a0implementation of this recommendation.\u00a0The roundtable comprises the GNECB, my Department, the Courts Service, the DPP, Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance.<\/p>  <p>  While guidelines were published in 2004, these have only been used to a very limited extent over the years and the Cost of Insurance Working Group proposed that a new set of guidelines should be developed, using the 2004 protocol as a starting point. In line with the intention to use the existing guidelines to inform the drafting of new, fit for purpose guidelines, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has produced a draft document which has been communicated to Insurance Ireland. The draft document proposed a number of changes to the section of the existing guidelines concerning the station or section within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to which a formal complaint should be made. Insurance Ireland signalled its agreement with the changes proposed at the roundtable session on 26 March 2018. <\/p>  <p>  At this same session, it was also agreed that further consultations with stakeholders regarding the proposed guidelines would take place, including with insurance providers not represented by Insurance Ireland, and a meeting to this effect was held on 27 April 2018, with a further meeting to be scheduled in the near future. <\/p>  <p>  The Fraud Roundtable also proposes to examine the follow-on procedure in circumstances where fraud or exaggeration is identified in court or acknowledged by a judge. <\/p>  <p>  Agreement on the new set of guidelines is expected to be completed on time in Quarter 3 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaging with my Department on an ongoing basis in relation to the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to note that the Department of Finance issues regular quarterly updates on its website in relation to the implementation of the respective reports of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, the latest (fifth) of which was published on 11 May 2018.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Training","counter":647,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN01100"},{"type":"question","counter":648,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[23131\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that have received specialist training to interview children as witnesses, victims and suspects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":649,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including training and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p><p>I have requested the specific information sought by the Deputy from the Commissioner and I will write to him on receipt of same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN01400"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[23133\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress he has made with the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Housing, Planning and Local Government, Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Garda Commissioner and other relevant agencies in identifying more effective possible solutions which can assist in dealing with the use of scrambler and quad bikes; the responsibilities he has assigned to each agency; the timeframe in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that a cross-agency meeting took place at my Department on 25 April 2018.

This is in the context of passenger numbers at Dublin Airport reaching record levels last year with almost 30 million passengers using the airport and compares very favourably with other modern airports in other jurisdictions. <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by INIS that the number of complaints it directly receives in relation to delays is extremely small - on average 60 per annum or to put it another way, 0.0004% of inbound passengers in 2017.\u00a0 It is the case that sometimes social media is used by passengers to raise concerns. On occasions when INIS has examined some of this coverage, it often transpires that passengers measure the time taken to clear all aspects of the arrival process, including embarking from the aircraft, baggage collection, customs, etc. with the immigration process only accounting for a portion of this period.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, there are specific pressure points outside of the control of the immigration authorities that can create some delay. Typically, this arises when a very high number of flights arrive within a specific time period (which occurs at Terminal 1 in the late evening period) with consequent increases to\u00a0passenger numbers within these peak times.\u00a0 This situation can be compounded when, in addition to scheduled arrivals, delayed flights also land during these peak periods.<\/p>  <p>  Additional immigration officers have been recruited for the airport and the allocation of personnel is designed to have the maximum number of staff on duty during the peak periods so that all available immigration booths are operational at these times. The number of available booths is a function of the physical infrastructure at each Terminal. Every effort is made by immigration officers to exercise their function as speedily as possible consistent with the requirement to protect our borders and facilitate legitimate travellers.<\/p>  <p>  While the immigration authorities at Dublin Airport have no control over the number of flights, their scheduling or actual arrival times, they have an excellent relationship with the\u00a0DAA and air carriers. All parties work closely together across a number of fronts to address capacity and queue management where they arise to alleviate congestion, to maximise passenger throughput, and ensure waiting times are kept to a minimum.<\/p>  <p>  I might add that automatic border control &lsquo;eGates&rsquo; have been operational at Dublin Airport since 30 November last. The eGates are open to Irish and EU e-passport holders over the age of 18 and it is planned that their use will be extended to other categories of passengers as the programme develops. \u00a0While their purpose is primarily an immigration control facility, they do have the effect of contributing overall to increased immigration processing capacity, particularly during spikes in passenger arrivals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct Provision Data","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN02000"},{"type":"question","counter":657,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[23263\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of direct provision residents over 18 years of age that have been in the asylum process for nine months or more and have not yet received a first instance decision.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":658,"content":"<p>There are 1,317 Direct Provision residents over 18 years of age that have been in the\u00a0protection process for nine months or more and have not yet received a first instance decision. <\/p>  <p>  As of 17 May 2018, over half of cases in the International Protection Office awaiting a first instance decision and where the applicant is accommodated under the system of Direct Provision, are less than one year in the system, while 95% are two years or less and 99.5% are three years or less.

Support and guidance is also available to interested groups from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the value that communities, especially rural communities, place on CCTV as a means of deterring crime and assisting in the detection of offenders and I would encourage interested groups to avail of the scheme.\u00a0Full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie.\u00a0 In addition, my officials are available to provide assistance and guidance to any interested party, with a dedicated email address available for that purpose - communitycctv@justice.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Repossessions Rate","counter":671,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN03500"},{"type":"question","counter":672,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[23433\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of proceedings outstanding in the Circuit Court for repossession of family homes by the year in which they were initiated; the number listed for hearing; the number that are adjourned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":673,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions, which include the provision of information on the courts system. <\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that court statistics and information\u00a0are not compiled in such a way as to provide the\u00a0detail sought by the Deputy.\u00a0In order to provide the information sought it would involve a\u00a0trawl of documentation for each court and\u00a0require a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources\u00a0to collate the data\u00a0requested.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, the Courts Service has advised that it would be in position to provide figures in relation to the number of proceedings lodged; the number of proceedings dealt with; and the number of adjournments granted for any timeframe that the\u00a0Deputy might request, although\u00a0please note that the figures for 2018 are not yet available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Money Laundering","counter":674,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN03800"},{"type":"question","counter":675,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[23487\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900077#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce or extend existing anti-money laundering regulations to those companies providing secretarial services or independent trust and corporate services providers which are used to hide beneficial ownership of many companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":676,"content":"<p>Companies providing secretarial services or independent trust and corporate services providers are considered &lsquo;designated persons&rsquo; under Section 25(1)(e) of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended, and are therefore subject to anti-money laundering regulations.

This report contained a number of recommendations to improve the criminal justice and regulatory response to harm perpetrated online. There is a growing concern around the whole area of online harm, which can include cyber-bullying and other behaviours such as distributing intimate images without consent. It was intended that my Department would bring forward legislation to give effect to the criminal law aspects of that report. However, due to competing legislative priorities, progress was not as rapid as I had hoped. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, Deputy Howlin introduced a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill to address the same issues outlined in the 2016 LRC report. The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill completed second stage in the D&aacute;il in January 2018 and was not opposed by Government. Cabinet approval was recently given to discontinue work on the Government Bill and to support Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Bill to ensure that legislation can be enacted as swiftly as possible. The main provisions of the Bill as published include:<\/p>  <p>  -  A new offence of non-consensual distribution of intimate images with\/without intent to cause harm or distress (generally referred to as &ldquo;revenge pornography&rdquo;). This will also be a sexual offence for the purpose of the Sex Offenders Act 2001, if an individual convicted is sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Whether the person against whom the offence was committed is underage or unable to guard themselves from harm is intended to be an aggravating factor to be considered in sentencing for the offence of non-consensual distribution of an image. <\/p>  <p>  -  The existing offence of sending threatening or indecent messages will be extended to apply to all threatening, false indecent and obscene messages using any form of online or traditional method of communications. <\/p>  <p>  -  The existing offence of harassment as contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 will be extended to include all forms of communication, including through online or digital communications.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My officials will be meeting with Deputy Howlin in the coming weeks with the intention of bringing forward Government amendments to ensure the Bill can be safely enacted. Any further amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 will\u00a0be considered at that juncture.\u00a0It is hoped that the Bill can be enacted by the end of the year.

Indeed I would further point out that some 45 community CCTV schemes were successfully established within this same legal framework between 2005 and 2013, with the support of the grant aid scheme administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department.<\/p>  <p>  While fully respecting the statutory requirements necessary for CCTV systems and the need for protection of public funds, the Department of course wishes to utilise as simple and user-friendly an application process as possible in relation to the grant-aid available.<\/p>  <p>  With this objective in mind, the application process and associated documentation for the current scheme were updated and streamlined by my Department, as compared to the previous scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Further, and again in the interests of avoiding any obstacles to uptake, in establishing the grant-aid scheme, the Department consulted broadly including with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of the Attorney General.\u00a0There was also consultation regarding the scheme with stakeholders including County and City Management Association (CCMA), Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), Irish Rural Link as well as interested\u00a0community groups.\u00a0 In addition, support and guidance remains available from officials in my Department\u00a0for any interested groups, should that be helpful in considering submitting an application to the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I am very keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, take advantage of the availability of this scheme. \u00a0With funding of some &euro;1 million available for each year of the scheme, there is room for a greater number of applications than we have seen to date. My Department is ready and willing to guide interested groups through the application process and I encourage any interested groups to make contact with my Department for assistance.\u00a0A dedicated email address is available for that purpose &ndash; communitycctv@justice.ie -\u00a0and full details of the grant aid package are also available to download from my Department's website www.justice.ie.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900078#WRO02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance Fraud","counter":720,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900078#WRO02900"},{"type":"question","counter":721,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[23710\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900078#WRO03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress he and the motor insurance working group have made in the establishment of an anti-fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in order to reduce insurance fraud and uninsured driving; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":722,"content":"<p>Recommendation 26 of the &lsquo;Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance&rsquo;,\u00a0published in\u00a0January 2017,\u00a0relates to exploring\u00a0the potential for further cooperation between the insurance sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to insurance fraud investigation.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>In order to deliver an effective policing service, it is essential that Garda management have the flexibility to deploy Garda resources to meet operational policing needs and address critical issues as they arise. For this reason, it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs at any given time. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that on the 30 April 2018, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 13,632. There are also 562 Garda Reserves and more than 2,280 civilians attached to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.  <\/p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested in March. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division.<\/p><p>I am informed that the detail of the number of Garda&iacute; and resources allocated to the Armed Support Units is deemed to be operationally sensitive and cannot be disclosed for security reasons.<\/p><p>For the Deputy's information I have set out in the attached tables the strength of each Station, District and Division for the years 2015-2017 and as of 30 April 2018.

They have a number of physiological effects; growth of skeletal muscle and bone, and the growth and maintenance of the reproductive system.  As such they are medicinal products and medicines containing anabolic steroids are subject to prescription control.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003, as amended, it is prohibited for a person to supply prescription-only medicines, except in accordance with a prescription.  The supply must be made from a registered pharmacy by, or under the personal supervision of, a registered pharmacist. The mail order supply of prescription-only medicines is also prohibited.  A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.<\/p>  <p>  The inappropriate use of prescription-only medicines can cause significant harm.  While a doctor may prescribe anabolic steroid containing medicines to treat specific medical conditions, the misuse of such drugs and their derivatives, for non-medical purposes,\u00a0poses a significant risk to human health. In addition, prescription-only medicines that are supplied illegally, including anabolic steroids, have often been shown to be falsified and there can be no guarantee as to their safety, quality or efficacy.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017 the Department of Health launched a new National Drugs Strategy.  The new strategy \"Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025&rdquo; has committed to establishing a working group to examine the evidence in relation to current and emerging trends of drug use including the use of image and performance enhancing drugs (IPED), which includes anabolic steroids.  This will be pursued by the HSE in conjunction with other relevant stakeholders during the term of the action plan of the strategy.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This action arose from reports by service providers of an increase in people who use IPED accessing the needle exchange programmes.  However, these harm reduction services are traditionally geared toward users of psychoactive substances not IPED.  Therefore, expanding the range and nature of models of practice may service to enhance accessibility, engagement and effectiveness for this at-risk group.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the Competent Authority for the implementation of EU and national legislation relating to medicines in Ireland.\u00a0 The Agency&rsquo;s role includes monitoring and inspecting medicinal products on the market to ensure their safety, efficacy and legality.<\/p>  <p>  One of HPRA&rsquo;s roles is to investigate potential breaches of legislation and, where necessary, to take corrective action including legal proceedings. The HPRA works closely with Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and international enforcement agencies to prevent the unauthorised flow of illegal medicinal products, including anabolic steroids.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, the HPRA detained 449,411 anabolic steroid dosage units (tablets, capsules, vials, etc.), compared to 109,006 units detained in 2016. This reflects the impact of intelligence-led enforcement activity by the HPRA, acting in conjunction and in cooperation with Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs.  The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018.  I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.  The proposals seek to ensure that:<\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation.<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health and I recently brought a Memorandum to Government for proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.  Following consideration of the matter,  it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the cabinet Agenda on 8 May last.  I intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussion at Cabinet, in due course.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following the closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":934,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS02600"},{"type":"question","counter":935,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[23286\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) can avail of rehabilitation services; the position of the person on the waiting list; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":936,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services","counter":937,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS02900"},{"type":"question","counter":938,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[23287\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the need to allow advanced nurse practitioners to provide initial assessment for access to CAMHS will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":939,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services Provision","counter":940,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS03200"},{"type":"question","counter":941,"qnumday":374,"qnumall":"[23288\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the need to open day hospitals to provide an alternative to acute hospital admission for those seeking access to CAMHS will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":942,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":943,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS03500"},{"type":"question","counter":944,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[21667\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900082#WRS03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied that all contracts a company (details supplied) holds with his Department and State agencies under his aegis have been tendered for; if his attention has been drawn to contracts awarded to the company that have not been tendered for; if his attention has been drawn to contracts awarded to the company that have rolled over; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":945,"content":"<p>As previously advised to Deputy Burton earlier this year, the Department has one contract with this company.

An additional &euro;9 million has been provided to the HSE in 2018 specifically to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including increasing access to scoliosis services. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE and Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group (CHG) developed a Paediatric Scoliosis Waiting List Action Plan for 2018 and this includes actions targeted at patients waiting longest for an outpatient appointment.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE advise that, under the National Service Plan 2018, funding for two new consultant posts for paediatric orthopaedics has been provided and these appointment are expected to be finalised in quarter 4 of 2018.

A central referrals system is being developed as part of this integration strategy which will be key to supporting clinical services to operate as a single service across multiple locations.

An additional &euro;9 million has been provided to the HSE in 2018 specifically to develop paediatric orthopaedic services, including increasing access to scoliosis services. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that it will maintain the 4-month target in 2018 and beyond, which is international best practice, for all patients who are clinically deemed to require scoliosis surgery now. <\/p>  <p>  Figures provided by the Children's Hospital Group (CHG) show that as of the week-ending 18th May 2018, there were 178 patients on the scoliosis waiting list, with 84 patients waiting more than 4 months.<\/p>  <p>  Patients waiting over 4 months are reviewed weekly in relation to their treatment plan. Decisions to schedule patients are made clinically. In line with the Scoliosis Action Plan 2018, the CHG will prioritise inpatient access to include outsourcing initiatives to achieve a 4 month waiting time for clinically deemed treatments and offers of outsourcing are currently being made to the families of those deemed clinically suitable. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE advise that, under the National Service Plan 2018, funding for two new consultant posts for paediatric orthopaedics has been provided and these appointments are expected to be finalised in quarter 4 of 2018. These posts are to be allocated to Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital for paediatric orthopaedics and are expected to have a positive impact on current patient waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  The CHG advise that capacity challenges are managed daily, with each of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals supporting each other in terms of bed utilisation and availability. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE advise that a Paediatric Scoliosis Services Co-Design group is in place, which includes clinicians, hospital staff and representatives from the scoliosis advocacy groups, to design a comprehensive, contemporary, and patient-centred approach to the delivery of scoliosis services.<\/p>  <p>  The CHG has developed an integration strategy to integrate clinical and non-clinical services across the three hospitals and to ensure a smooth transition to the new facilities.

It is also focussed on implementing the recommendations of the 'MacCraith Group' to support the recruitment and retention of consultants and NCHDs.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of nurses and midwives, increasing nursing and midwifery numbers has been a priority for the past 18 months. The 2017 funded workforce plan, as part of the Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement, committed the HSE to recruiting 1,224 additional nurses and midwives.\u00a0 The final report setting out progress on implementation of the Agreement shows that there has been a significant growth in the appointment of nurses and midwives with 942 WTE of the 1,224 posts filled (WTE&rsquo;s). The HSE remain committed to the Agreement and efforts will continue to fill the remaining posts. It has once again committed to offer all 2018 graduating student nurses and midwives permanent contracts within a Hospital Group or CHO, subject to their attaining registration and satisfactory performance.<\/p>  <p>  I also note that the Public Service Pay Commission is currently looking at a number of medical grades, including consultants and nurses and midwives\u00a0in the current phase of its work and is expected to report at the end of June.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900087#WRX03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmaceutical Sector","counter":1215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900087#WRX03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1216,"qnumday":468,"qnumall":"[23779\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900087#WRX03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which the use of the single European market can be identified as a means of alleviating the impact of persons currently faced with the high cost of experimental drugs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1217,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have sought clarification from the Deputy and on receipt of same I will arrange for a reply to issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900087#WRX03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1218,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900087#WRX03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1219,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[23780\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900087#WRX03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the degree to which lack of theatre space of a particular category has been identified as a contributory factor in the ongoing delays experienced by persons on waiting lists; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1220,"content":"<p>Improving waiting times for hospital procedures is a key commitment in the Programme for Government.

Permits for shorter periods are also available.\u00a0 On average, permit fees account for an annual income of &euro;120,000 and the cost to IFI to protect, develop, manage and conserve these fisheries is considerably in excess of this. <\/p>  <p>  I would also advise,\u00a0regarding salmon and sea trout licences, that a fisheries conservation component was applied to all licence fees in 2007, as part of a suite of conservation measures for the management of wild fisheries. This component represents 50% of the licence fee, and income generated from this component is ring-fenced by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) for the rehabilitation of salmon habitats and conservation measures throughout the country. <\/p>  <p>  All of the proceeds of the salmon and sea trout licence fees income are reinvested, by IFI, in the conservation, protection and development of wild fisheries habitats and stocks directly, or through the Salmon Conservation Fund\u00a0scheme, with a particular emphasis on prioritised investment in those rivers in most need of rehabilitation.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, a significant portion of the permit revenue collected by IFI in relation to the management of ESB fisheries is redistributed into the catchments by way of the Midlands Fisheries Fund, which provides funding to angling clubs, community groups etc., to enhance those fisheries<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900089#WRZ03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal Charges","counter":1329,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900089#WRZ03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1330,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[23797\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900089#WRZ03900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if new requirements are being introduced to require waste companies to charge for recyclable material collected in the recyclables bin later in 2018; and if so, the approximate timeline for same.","asker":"1222","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1331,"content":"<p>There are\u00a0no plans to introduce\u00a0a requirement\u00a0for waste collection companies to charge for collecting recycling. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900089#WRZ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Transport","counter":1332,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900089#WRZ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1333,"qnumday":507,"qnumall":"[24028\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900089#WRZ04200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of ministerial cars or vehicles in operation in each of the past six years; and the costs associated with same.","asker":"1347","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1334,"content":"<p>Under new arrangements agreed by Government in March 2011, Ministers, with the exception of the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality who retained their State car and Garda Drivers, could appoint two civilian drivers to drive their personal car, and claim mileage and related costs.

This programme will\u00a0provide safe alternative active travel routes to help alleviate congestion by providing viable alternatives and connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure.<\/p><p>In addition to these cycling-specific investments, BusConnects, that will involve re-configuring the bus network and infrastructure, will also entail construction of significant new cycling facilities alongside bus routes on the key radial routes into the city centre and provide safe cycling arrangements, largely segregated from other traffic along those corridors.\u00a0 These substantial investments will allow us to further increase the numbers cycling, thereby easing congestion, improving public health and enhancing the liveability of our cities.<\/p><p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, including\u00a0the maintenance of existing cycle lanes.

This contribution takes the form of both current, Public Service obligation (PSO), funding and also capital funding. <\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Obligation (PSO)\u00a0funding\u00a0to transport operators for providing subvented public transport (i.e. bus and rail) services is paid by the National Transport Authority from the current expenditure monies that are made available to the Department's Vote annually as part of the Estimates process.\u00a0 Decisions on the PSO allocations to particular operators are made annually by the NTA having regard to the Authority's\u00a0statutory role and the\u00a0PSO contracts that it has in place with each of the individual providers.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to the public transport system continuing to provide and develop services that are essential for local communities.\u00a0 That commitment is evidenced by the 8% increase secured in Budget 2018 for PSO services across both the bus and rail networks.\u00a0 That means that a total of over &euro;285 million will be allocated in 2018 to support the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services across the public transport companies.  Budget 2018 also provided for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment\u00a0for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021.\u00a0 This represents a 30% increase over the original Capital Plan allocations for 2018-2021 and includes investment of over &euro;1 billion in heavy rail maintenance and infrastructure.<\/p>  <p>  The Rail Review Report was undertaken jointly by the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and was published in 2016. The purpose of the Review was:<\/p>  <p> -   to\u00a0\u00a0look at the existing rail network;<\/p>  <p>  - to\u00a0\u00a0identify the funding required both to maintain the network and to provide for necessary capital works;<\/p>  <p>  - and to consider the gap in funding.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Rail Review was published, there have been significant developments in relation to the level of funding available for rail investment and services.\u00a0 The public consultation process held by the NTA following the publication of the Rail Review in 2016 helped to begin an informed discussion about the current and future role of rail transport in Ireland.  Over 300 submissions were received in response to that consultation process.  The NTA has prepared a report of those submissions, which it recently updated to reflect the increased funding made available in Budget 2018 for both current subvention and, in particular, the Capital Plan 2018 to 2021. \u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NTA&rsquo;s updated report on the consultation was received\u00a0by my Department in February.\u00a0 I\u00a0intend to bring the updated consultation report to Government shortly and\u00a0I would expect that the consultation report would then be published thereafter by the NTA.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Bus &Eacute;ireann specifically, capital investment of over &euro;44 million has been provided in the last two years for PSO bus fleet replacement and refurbishment and accessibility projects.  In addition, current PSO subvention in 2017 was over &euro;52 million, an increase of 28% on 2016.

propose to take Questions Nos. 546, 547 and 549 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, Budget 2018 provided a four-year enhanced capital envelope for public transport of over &euro;2.7 billion to 2021 including funding of over &euro;400 million for investment in public transport in 2018.\u00a0 This increased funding will allow the roll-out of a number of key programmes to address congestion and emerging capacity constraints and enhance safety on our public transport system across our cities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In response to the Deputy I am assuming the question relates to the heavy rail network.  Over &euro;220 million capital investment in heavy rail infrastructure is allocated between now and 2021.\u00a0 This will deliver: the City Centre Re-signalling Project to improve speeds on mainline rail; a new rail Central Traffic Control Centre; progress on the DART Expansion Programme to include increase rail fleet and further progress on electrification of both the Northern rail line to Balbriggan and the Maynooth line, and currently a contract is underway to introduce 28 rail carriages that are expected to re-enter service in 2019.  Additionally, Irish Rail and the National Transport Authority (NTA) are assessing the availability of additional fleet that could be introduced to passenger service on the rail network in Ireland in the short-term, prior to the delivery of new diesel electric trains expected in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Capital funding also includes investment in maintenance and safety projects including the development of an automatic train protection system and enhanced communications system, to maintain safety and service levels in railway operations of our national railway system.\u00a0 Multi-annual funding of almost &euro;30 million over the next four years will continue the programme of retro-fitting older, existing public transport facilities to improve their accessibility features.\u00a0 This effectively triples the previously planned investment amount.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to capital funding allocations, there are also a number other heavy rail measures being taken in the short-term to deliver additional transport capacity, including a 10 minute DART service \u00a0that will be provided later this year and the current peak time rail services from the Kildare Rail Line linking with the City Centre through the Phoenix Park Tunnel will be expanded to provide an all-day service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900091#WRBB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cycling Facilities Funding","counter":1441,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900092#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1442,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[23398\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900092#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated cost of implementing the remaining measures in the Greater Dublin Area Cycle Network Plan.","asker":"1333","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1443,"content":"<p>The National Transport Authority's (NTA) \"Transport Strategy for the GDA 2016-2035\" includes the Greater\u00a0Dublin Area\u00a0Cycle Network Plan, an ambitious plan for the development of a safe and\u00a0high quality cycling network.  As the Deputy may be aware, Budget 2018 announced the allocation of funding over a four year period to progress a number of key\u00a0projects which are\u00a0included in the NTA's strategy and the Cycle Network Plan.  These commitments were also announced as part of Government's Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  Over &euro;110 million in capital funding is directly allocated to develop cycling and walking infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford over the period 2018-2021.

Allocation of funding and details of individual projects are managed by the National Transport Authority in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  A further\u00a0&euro;135 million capital funding is allocated\u00a0over this same period for investment in Sustainable Urban Transport projects, and these will include\u00a0projects that will provide either direct or\u00a0indirect improvements for urban\u00a0cycling.  This programme builds on investment to date to deliver improvements in public and sustainable transport infrastructure in the regional cities and the GDA.  It includes traffic management, bus priority and other smarter travel projects, which will allow transport infrastructure to function more effectively and will help relieve traffic congestion.

The fundamental qualification criteria for maternity benefit are that a woman must be in insurable employment or self-employment and is contingent on entitlement to statutory maternity leave.  The applicant must also satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions.  A further 16 weeks&rsquo; of additional maternity leave is also available from work, which must begin immediately after the end of the paid maternity leave.  This period is not covered by maternity benefit, nor is the employer obliged, unless otherwise agreed, to make any payment during this period.<\/p>  <p>  The jobseeker's benefit (JB) and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) schemes provide income support for people who have lost work and who are available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.

Now that Ireland&rsquo;s economy is back on a firmer footing, it is a moral and societal imperative that we work together to address the real needs of the Traveller community.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2017, my colleague, Mr. David Stanton TD., Minster of State for Justice with special responsibility for Equality, Immigration and Integration, launched the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy for the years 2017-2021 inclusive.  This Inclusion Strategy is a cross-Departmental initiative to improve the lives of the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  The development of the Strategy involved a comprehensive public consultation process, including two rounds of public meetings and engagement with Traveller organisations at national level.  Integral to the finalisation of the Inclusion Strategy was the work of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which has members from relevant Government Departments as well as Traveller and Roma representatives and advocates.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the consultation process, ten key themes were identified as central to the success of the Inclusion strategy, and two of these relate most directly to employment.<\/p>  <p>  First, the Strategy recognises that &ldquo;there is a very large disparity between Travellers and non-Travellers in the level of education completed&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the labour market disadvantage of Travellers is largely linked to that educational disadvantage.&rdquo;  Accordingly, the Strategy identifies 14 different actions aimed at improving access, participation and outcomes for Travellers and Roma in education in order to achieve outcomes that are equal to those for the majority population.<\/p>  <p>  Employment and the Traveller Economy is also identified as a specific key theme in the strategy and it includes a range of relevant actions.  Within this range of actions, my Department has committed to delivering and supporting a range of assistive and targeted measures to increase employment, training and apprenticeship opportunities for Travellers and Roma over the long term by:<\/p>  <p>  -  Promoting the availability of existing employment and training services to the Roma and Traveller communities and continuing to ensure promotional and information materials on its schemes are available and accessible via the Department&rsquo;s website;<\/p>  <p>  -  Providing tailored supports for the long-term unemployed and for young people to build their confidence and prepare them for the workplace;<\/p>  <p>  -  Developing targeted initiatives to increase Traveller and Roma engagement with employment and training services;<\/p>  <p>  -  Providing Anti-racism and cultural awareness training for staff under the new shared Civil Service learning and development curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  -  Ensuring that Travellers and Roma, under the age of 25, who register as unemployed claimants of Jobseekers&rsquo; payments will receive a good quality offer of employment, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within a period of four months of registering, in line with commitments under the Youth Guarantee.<\/p>  <p>  The Inclusion Strategy is a living document, with monitoring of its implementation a key and integral part of its potential success.

Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has been designated as the national authority for the provision of public water services, a role previously vested in 34 (now 31) local authorities.  Irish Water therefore has statutory responsibility for all aspects of public water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. It is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions and in relation to day to day operational matters. I, as Minister, and my Department must respect the statutory powers and functions which the Oireachtas has conferred on Irish Water.<\/p>  <p>  The Water Services Acts place specific responsibilities on me as Minister, including responsibility for matters relevant to water policy, funding and in the making of regulations.  The Water Services Acts also put in place a variety of legislative and regulatory controls to ensure governance, oversight and accountability in relation to water services.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Services Strategic Plan (WSSP) published in 2015 sets out the strategic objectives for its delivery of water services over 25 years up to 2040 in order to ensure the provision of clean safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for social and economic development. The Irish Water Business Plan, Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021 (also published in 2015), sets out its short to medium term planning in implementing the first phase of the Water Services Strategic Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water is regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as the independent economic regulator. The CRU is responsible for setting the total level of revenue which Irish Water can receive, through Government subvention and from customers, to cover its efficiently incurred costs. This CRU process involves, inter alia, reviewing submissions from Irish Water, including on its investment plan, and thereafter setting appropriate revenue allowances for operating costs, capital costs and other items for given regulatory periods. Consequently, the actual allowed operational expenditure and capital investment is decided by the CRU.   <\/p>  <p>  On 21 May 2018, I published the Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 following its approval by Government. The Policy Statement gives clear direction to strategic planning and decision making on water and wastewater services in Ireland.  The Policy Statement sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of Quality, Conservation, and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans. The Policy Statement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<\/p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/files\/water_services_policy_statement_2018-2025_0.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to housing provision, the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness published in July 2016 is designed to accelerate housing supply and gives rise to an associated need for investment in water infrastructure and the provision of water services. The Water Services Policy Statement acknowledges that the objectives of the Government&rsquo;s strategic approach to housing identified in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and in the National Planning Framework will need to be provided for in terms of both treatment and network capacity. It is further acknowledged in the Policy Statement that related initiatives such as the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) and the Major Urban Housing Delivery (MUHD) sites are to be supported.<\/p>  <p>  Within 3 months of publication of the Water Services Policy Statement, Irish Water must prepare a &lsquo;Strategic Funding Plan&rsquo; setting out proposed operational and capital expenditure.  Subject to its approval by me as Minister, the Strategic Funding Plan will ultimately feed into annual Exchequer decisions on spending.  This Strategic Funding Plan will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>  <p>  Based on this Strategic Funding Plan, Irish Water&rsquo;s next Capital Investment Plan for the five year period from 2020 to 2024 will set out the financial plan for capital investments to support Irish Water&rsquo;s strategic objectives, as set out in the WSSP and in its Business Plan, to deliver improvements to water services where they are needed most. Irish Water will also take account of developing subsidiary programmes within its investment plan to assist in implementing the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan including the forthcoming Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies as well as ongoing reviews of local authority statutory land use plans.  It is in this context that investment decisions in relation to individual projects will be made, including in respect of water services infrastructure that supports the development of housing.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that Oireachtas members may obtain information on issues arising in relation to Irish Water's activities, arrangements have been made for the establishment, within Irish Water, of a team to deal with any such queries efficiently.  The team may be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on 1890 578 578.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900096#WRGG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payment Administration","counter":1668,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900096#WRGG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1669,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[23324\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018052900096#WRGG01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will address an anomaly in the housing assistance payment whereby private rented properties may be deemed not to qualify for HAP even if the person otherwise qualifies for reasons of sustainable communities and-or tenure mix; the basis upon which decisions relating to sustainable communities and-or tenure mix HAP refusals are made; his views on the case of a person (details supplied); the number of such HAP applications refused due to this policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1670,"content":"<p>Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for housing support through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;2.2 million was provided to the Housing Agency in 2014 to meet expenditure incurred under the scheme in respect of design work, contractors, expenses to homeowners, operational costs, and the administrative costs to the Housing Agency.

Last year, some &euro;25 million was provided, facilitating the remediation of some 400 additional dwellings, giving an aggregate total of 945 dwellings completed from when the scheme was first introduced up to the end of 2017. <\/p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;30 million was announced under Budget 2018 to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme this year, of which &euro;9.25 million has already been drawn down by the Housing Agency.  This allocation will facilitate the remediation of some 430 additional dwellings and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings.<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures available indicate that a total of 2,058 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme.  Of these, 1,622 dwellings have been included in the scheme and the applicants notified accordingly. A further 94 applications have been validated and referred to the Housing Agency for the Assessment and Verification Process, while another 212 applications are at the initial Application and Validation stage. 130 applications under the scheme were not successful.<\/p>  <p>  Of the 1,622 dwellings that have been included in the pyrite remediation scheme:<\/p>  <p>  - 235 are at remedial works planning stage, <\/p>  <p>  - 111 are at tender \/ tender analysis,<\/p>  <p>  - 51 are at tender decision,  <\/p>  <p>  - 167 are under remediation, and  <\/p>  <p>  - 1,058 are complete. <\/p>  <p>  Applications under the scheme continue to be received at a rate of approximately 10 per week; this rate is likely to be maintained over the course of 2018.

It is unlikely that applications will cease entirely post end-2018 but will begin to reduce at a gradual rate over time.<\/p>  <p>  The average all in cost of remediation in 2016 was in the region of &euro;70,000 per dwelling. There can, however, be significant variation in costs, with one-off houses generally having larger ground floor areas being the most expensive.<\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, the Pyrite Remediation Board, together with the Housing Agency, will arrange for all eligible dwellings to be remediated to a high standard and at no additional cost to the affected homeowners.

Through the supports made available from my Department, funding is available to all local authorities to deliver additional social housing stock through a range of initiatives, including, where appropriate, the acquisition of new and previously owned houses\/apartments from the private market. <\/p><p>As housing authorities, it is a matter in the first instance for each local authority to determine the suitability of any units for acquisition. Indeed, responsibility for identifying and undertaking such social housing acquisitions is largely delegated to local authorities, so that they may respond flexibly to all opportunities to provide new social housing in their functional areas.  Funding is provided on the basis that the houses are suitable for social housing use and are suitable also in terms of a range of other considerations, including sensitivity to local markets and value for money. Details on the number of social houses purchased by all local authorities are available on my Department's website at the following link: <\/p><p>.<\/p><p>In addition to direct acquisitions by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) may acquire properties for social housing under the Capital Assistance Scheme and the Capital Advance Leasing Facility. <\/p><p>Harnessing the capacity of existing vacant properties for social housing is a high priority for the Government.

The Housing Agency have made significant advances in terms of acquisitions to date and have been liaising with local authorities and AHBs nationwide. To date, the purchase of 383 properties has been completed.  <\/p><p>A key priority under Rebuilding Ireland is to increase the level of newly built social housing on a year by year basis. In 2016 and 2017, delivery programmes focussed on harnessing the best options available to secure early and increased delivery. This included acquisitions of vacant stock nationally, completions of unfinished estates, advancing straightforward build projects that could proceed quickly and ensuring that maximum use was secured from existing local authority housing, while in parallel the new-build pipeline was expanded significantly to underpin the much increased delivery projected for the years 2018 to 2021.  <\/p><p>In 2018, we will see the results of enhanced building capacity across Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies, which will further enhance our scope to meet individuals&rsquo; and families&rsquo; needs across the country through additional stock.
