The rules of natural justice and fair procedures are applied by deciding officers when making decisions that could have an adverse effect on the person concerned.  The deciding officer must satisfy him\/herself that the person: is aware of all the information that could adversely affect his\/her entitlement; was notified that his\/her entitlement was under review; was given an opportunity to comment and to submit any facts or information to correct any inaccuracy or incompleteness in the information; and any comments made by the person are clearly and fully considered before a decision is made.<\/p><p>  Deciding officers and others involved in the process will assist claimants as far as possible in making their applications but, as a matter of law, the burden of providing evidence to support a claim rests with claimants.<\/p><p>  Disqualifications and disallowances are issued to the customer in writing and include an explanation of the reason\/s for the decision.  The disallowance\/disqualification grounds, and reason\/s for same, are outlined clearly and are sufficient to enable the appellant to lodge an appeal.  <\/p><p>  It is considered that issuing copies of claimants&rsquo; files or telephoning applicants prior to making a decision would place an unnecessary and unreasonable burden on resources in the Department and would impact on operating costs and processing times. Persons wishing to access their files are facilitated individually as requests are made.<\/p><p>  Persons are advised, in decision letters, of their right to seek a Departmental review of the initial decision and are advised as to how to lodge an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).   Where a review is sought, the deciding officer re-examines the case and, taking account of any new facts or evidence, may revise his\/ her decision.  In 2011, 42% of favourable decisions made following lodgement of appeal applications, were as a result of deciding officers revising their original decisions, which obviated the need for claimants to go through the full appeals process.  These revised decisions arose as a result, in most cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his \/her claim.  The figures illustrate that the review process is well understood and utilised.<\/p><p>  Decisions regarding the recoupment of overpayments are administrative in nature and do not fall within the remit of the SWAO.

In a very small number of cases, changes in circumstances may come to light in the short period between the appeals officer making his\/ her decision and its implementation, which would require revision of the appeals officer&rsquo;s decision e.g. cases where evidence of fraud is discovered.  There are also a very limited number of cases where the Chief Appeals Officer may be asked to review the appeals officer&rsquo;s decision.

The recommendations made in the report are now being examined in the Department and in the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO).<\/p><p>  One of the recommendations relates to the independence of the SWAO.  The SWAO is a separate executive office with its own premises and staff which operates independently of the Department and the Minister.   The appeals process <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">has a statutory basis in both primary and secondary legislation and Appeals Officers are quasi-judicial officers who are required to be free and unrestricted in discharging their functions. As far back as 1958, the Supreme Court found that Appeals Officers are required to free and unrestricted in the performance of their duties. The high level of appeals allowed (42% in 2011) is evidence of the indep<\/font>endence of the process.  There are no plans to take legislative steps to change the method by which Appeals Officers are appointed.<\/p><p>  The report also criticises the delays being experienced by appellants. As Deputies are aware there was a rapid and sustained increase in the number of appeals from 2009 to date which has placed extraordinary pressure on the SWAO. Significant resources and efforts have been put into reducing backlogs and improving processing times for appellants, including the assignment of 15 additional Appeals Officers, retraining retired experienced officers for 18 months ending December 2011, improving business processes and implementing a new operating model.  <\/p><p>  As a result of these measures, there has been significant increase in the number of appeals finalised from an average of 13,500 to 34,027 in 2011 and that the processing times reduced by an overall 10.2 weeks in the nine months to September 2012 as the oral hearing time is down by 12.5 weeks and the summary decision time is up by 2.3 weeks.  Of course, further improvement is needed.   In that regard, the Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more cases in 2013 than in 2012; there is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals; and it is planned to recruit 8 additional Medical Assessors in 2013.  All these measures together will reduce the waiting time for appellants.<\/p><p>  Concern was expressed in the report that the higher number of summary decisions in 2011 indicated a move away from oral hearings. I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that the increases in the number of summary decisions in 2010 and 2011 was a result of having eight very experienced retired appeals officers working exclusively on summary decisions which had the effect of front loading summary decisions.    The percentage of summary decisions was 69% in 2010 and 65% in 2011, the two years for which the retired officers were retained, and has since dropped to 56% in 2012.<\/p><p>  In relation to consistency and transparency in decision making, this is addressed in a number of ways by the Department through training and communication and in relation specifically to the SWAO it is the statutory responsibility of the Chief Appeals Officer to convene meetings of Appeals Officers for the purpose of ensuring consistency.<\/p><p>  The Department provides funding to a number of agencies involved in providing advocacy and information services to persons regarding their social welfare rights and how to process its systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300058#WRA04000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":56,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 119 and 120 answered with Question No. 110.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sick Pay Scheme","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300059#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[49893\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300059#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the steps that she has taken to reform the sick pay scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>The position remains that the range of complex issues associated with the possible introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay, including such matters as the provision of possible compensatory mechanisms for particularly vulnerable employers, the extent of coverage of such a scheme, the appropriate rate of payment involved and how a scheme would be enforced, continue to be examined in the Department.

Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  As part of the Department&rsquo;s programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years. Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.<\/p><p>  In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  For example, ten additional staff are being assigned to deal specifically with a backlog in claims carers claims area. The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I wish to assure the Deputy that prompt processing of claims remains a priority for me.<\/p><p>  In relation to appeals, there are ongoing efforts to reduce the processing times.

When an appeal is received, it is acknowledged, the Department makes a submission to the SWAO on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant. Part of this process is a review by the Department of the initial decision in light of new evidences or information submitted as part of the appeal.  For example, in the case of schemes which include medical criteria, the time taken by the Department will almost always include a review by a different medical assessor to the one who initially examined the case.  In cases where a person&rsquo;s means are the issue, a further visit by a Social Welfare Inspector may be required.  All of this adds time to the process.<\/p><p>In effect the Department allows multiple reviews and submissions of fresh evidence to ensure the applicant gets every opportunity to make their case. A number of jurisdictions do not do this and inevitably restrict the opportunities of the applicant. Nonetheless, there is no doubt further improvement is needed and there are plans in place to do so.  In relation to the SWAO itself, the Chief Appeals Officer expects to finalise 6,000 more claims in 2013 than will be finalised this year.  This will be achieved through the additional capacity generated as the newer Appeals Officers become experienced.  As things stand, with turnover of staff and additional new recruits, 25 Appeals Officers have less than 18 months experience.<\/p><p>There is a major programme of process redesign and modernisation currently underway in relation to many scheme areas which will reduce scheme backlogs and will also reduce the time taken for the Department to respond to requests from the SWAO for submissions in relation to appeals. It is also planned to improve the capacity of the Medical Review and Assessment Service through the recruitment of additional Medical Assessors in 2013.  All of these measures taken together will reduce the waiting times for appellants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300060#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300060#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":127,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[49990\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300060#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the ongoing delays of over six months in the processing of disability, invalidity and carer's allowance applications and the difficulties it is causing for members of the public who have to live with the uncertainty of the status of their entitlements for up to a year in some cases; the action being taken to address the backlog; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":128,"content":"<p>There has been a significant increase in the number of new claims received in all these three schemes over the past 3-4 years.  A major service delivery modernisation project has been undertaken to improve the efficiency of administration of the three scheme areas in question and to help to deal with the increased volumes. This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation.  Full deployment of the new system for invalidity pension (IP) and carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) is now completed and will be completed for disability allowance (DA) by the end of this month.  In tandem with the full implementation of the new system, comprehensive business process improvement exercises were recently completed in both IP and CA areas, the focus of which is to optimise performance and provide improved customer service.  New organisational structures were introduced and additional temporary staff were allocated to IP and CA areas to support these initiatives.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to say that the number of IP claims awaiting decision has decreased from 7,267 at the end of May 2012 to 4,560 at the end of October 2012 and continues to decrease.

The number of claims awaiting decision there at the end of September was 10,322 and has reduced to 9,517 at the end of October 2012.  Furthermore, an additional 10 temporary staff are being assigned to expedite backlog claim clearance in CA.  It will take a number of months before the backlog is cleared but the process is continually monitored to ensure backlog eliminated in the shortest possible timeframe.<\/p><p>  The current average time taken to process new DA applications is 17 weeks.  Following the full deployment of the new system later this month, a similar business process improvement initiative will be commenced and a programme will be put in place to eliminate backlog of new applications. In the meantime, temporary staff  have been assigned to DA to support the modernisation project and overtime working is being operated as appropriate.  It should be noted that the time required to process a new application in each of the three schemes can vary depending on the complexity of the individual circumstances and the information provided by the claimant.

The Presidency staffing plan for the Permanent Representation in Brussels was prepared following a carefully coordinated inter-departmental needs evaluation.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions. We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums. Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre. So far in 2012, 57 Irish observers have been involved in missions organised by both the EU and OSCE, across 11 countries.<\/p><p>Observers who participate in missions supported by the Department are entitled to<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>one pre-departure grant of &#8364;600 in every twelve month period to cover any costs incurred in preparing for the trip, including vaccinations and other medical expenses. For EU led missions, any additional costs are covered by the European Commission.Observer costs for OSCE-led Missions are met by the participating countries. In Ireland&#8217;s case, these funds come from the Irish Aid budget. <\/p><p>The election observation programme is subject to continuous monitoring to ensure it is efficient and effective and provides the best possible value for money. A list in tabular form of the costs for each Irish election observer funded by Irish Aid from January 1<sup>st<\/sup> 2012 to date is set out below. For obvious reasons, the costs associated with long-term observers (LTO) are higher than those for short-term observers (STO).<\/p><p>There are currently some 300 people on the Election Observation Roster. At present, the roster is not open for new members but I am aware that there are quite a number of individuals interested in joining the roster.I am keen to ensure that members of the roster will have the specific skills requested by the OSCE and the EU, including language skills. As previously stated, I have asked officials to carry out a detailed review of the roster and how it works, and to prepare proposals on future membership. I hope that the review will be completed in the near future.<\/p><p><b>Election Observation Missions 2012 to date<\/b><\/p><p><b>(57 observers on 11 missions)<\/b><\/p><p><b><i>COUNTRYORGANISATIONROLENAME COST&#8364;<\/i><\/b><b><\/b><\/p><p><b>January<\/b><\/p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOPatricia Barker 3,643<\/p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOPaddy Buckenham 3,193<\/p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOPaul Cosgrave 3,643<\/p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOMichael Humphreys 3,643<\/p><p>KazakhstanOSCESTOCecilia Keaveney 3,643<\/p><p><b>February<\/b><\/p><p>SenegalEULTODiarmuid Peavoy 0<\/p><p>SenegalEUSTOAidan O&#8217;Shea 0<\/p><p><b>March<\/b><\/p><p>RussiaOSCELTOMichael Verling17,029<\/p><p>RussiaOSCESTOGrattan Lynch 4,301<\/p><p>RussiaOSCESTOJulian Clare 3,756<\/p><p>RussiaOSCESTONoreen Kerins 4,301<\/p><p>RussiaOSCESTOChris Andrews 4,301<\/p><p><b>May<\/b><\/p><p>ArmeniaOSCELTOSean O&#8217;Callaghan 6,967<\/p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOAnn Ormonde 3,304<\/p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOBlaise Treacy 3,304<\/p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOEdward Horgan 3,304<\/p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOJames McNamara 3,304<\/p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOTerence Fleming 3,304<\/p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOBrian Fagan 3,304<\/p><p>ArmeniaOSCESTOEimear Friel 2,717<\/p><p>Serbia IOSCELTOOrla Cluff 6,827<\/p><p>Serbia IIOSCELTOPeter McMahon 3,685<\/p><p>AlgeriaEULTODorcha Lee 600<\/p><p>AlgeriaEUSTOMary Boland 0<\/p><p>AlgeriaEUSTOPeter Ballagh 0<\/p><p><b>July<\/b><\/p><p>Timor LesteEULTOMary O&#8217;Shea 0<\/p><p><b>September<\/b><\/p><p>BelarusOSCELTOPeter Donovan8,086<\/p><p>BelarusOSCESTONoel Brennan 2,775<\/p><p>BelarusOSCESTOJulian Clare 2,230<\/p><p>BelarusOSCESTOPatrick Finneran 2,775<\/p><p>BelarusOSCESTOFinbar O&#8217;Sullivan 2,541<\/p><p>BelarusOSCESTODeirdre Grogan 2,857<\/p><p>BelarusOSCESTOMark Long 2,857<\/p><p>BelarusOSCESTORebecca Moynihan 2,775<\/p><p>BelarusOSCESTOAnne Choiseul 2,775<\/p><p><b>October<\/b><\/p><p>GeorgiaOSCELTOEithne MacDermott 6,730<\/p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOCecilia Keaveney 3,546<\/p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOEileen McCabe 4,146<\/p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOJohn O&#8217;Connor 4,122<\/p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOPeter Emerson 4,146<\/p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOConor O&#8217;Clery 4,122<\/p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOJames Mallon 4,122<\/p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTOLes Allamby 4,122<\/p><p>GeorgiaOSCESTORichard McEvoy 4,122<\/p><p>UkraineOSCELTOSeamus Martin11,473<\/p><p>UkraineOSCELTOMichael Verling10,746<\/p><p>UkraineOSCESTOEric Byrne 3,258<\/p><p>UkraineOSCESTOGeraldine Power 3,425<\/p><p>UkraineOSCESTORaymond Dunne 3,425<\/p><p>UkraineOSCESTOCiaran Kinsella 3,425<\/p><p>UkraineOSCESTOFionnuala Brennan 3,425<\/p><p>UkraineOSCESTOKevin Grogan 3,425<\/p><p>UkraineOSCESTOJulian Clare 2,825<\/p><p>UkraineOSCESTOThomas Bellew 2,827<\/p><p><b>November<\/b><\/p><p>Sierra LeoneEULTOColm Fahy600<\/p><p>Sierra LeoneEUSTOMichael Coyne600<\/p><p>Sierra LeoneEUSTOMichael Boyle600<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Communities Abroad","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[50054\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"with reference to the assertion in Fresh perspective: A Needs Analysis of the Irish Community in London, October 2012 that 25.8% of the London Irish community suffer poor health and that isolation may contribute to this poor health, the work his Department is undertaking to address causes and results of isolation within the Irish community in London;

Since 2004 the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP), previously D&iacute;on, has provided financial support for frontline welfare services. There is an Irish Abroad Unit in my Department and an Irish Communities Section in the Embassy in London reflecting the importance of this issue.  Irish organisations in Britain are the largest recipients of ESP funding and have received grants amounting to over &#8364;70million since 2004.  The emphasis of the Programme&#8217;s funding in Britain, as elsewhere, is on supporting frontline welfare services.

The ESP funds many professional services that provide expert advice and assist Irish people access the relevant supports provided in relation to social, housing and medical needs to name but a few.

In identifying the main priorities of the Presidency, the Taoiseach and I have asked all members of the Government to use the Presidency to focus on the jobs and growth agenda across all policy formations.  Tackling unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment, and creating the conditions for sustainable economic growth, will be the core priorities of the Irish Presidency.     The General Affairs Council, which I will chair, deals with a broad range of cross-cutting issues including the EU&#8217;s future financing.  During the Presidency I will work to deliver on a complex EU budgetary process.  My aim is to ensure that the Union supports a range of programmes and initiatives that can underpin economic recovery, growth and job creation, and promote greater social inclusion and regional cohesion.  The future enlargement of the EU will also figure prominently on the General Affairs Council agenda during the Presidency.  EU enlargement is good for European stability and peace and, as Chairperson, I will work to make progress in this area.  <\/p><p>  To stimulate job creation and growth across the EU, the Irish Presidency has already identified key policy areas aimed at making sure that the Single Market, which has delivered so many benefits for consumers and business over the past two decades, is better equipped to deal with the rapidly evolving digital economy.  Our Presidency will also place a strong emphasis on promoting greater coordination of, and support for, the Union&#8217;s research and innovation agenda, to ensure that the EU can become more globally competitive.  But Europe also needs to look beyond its own borders to facilitate more exports which can sustain and create employment and economic growth.  This is why Ireland, as Presidency, is placing a strong emphasis on moving the EU external trade agenda forward.  A meeting of Trade focusing on the on the EU-US trade relationship will take place in April 2013.  We hope to deliver a mandate for EU-US trade talks.<\/p><p>The Irish Presidency will support the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and the European External Action Service in promoting the Union&#8217;s values of peace, democracy and respect for human rights abroad.  These values were explicitly recognised in the awarding of the Nobel Prize to the EU.  Much of the Foreign Affairs Council agenda will be taken up with responding to current events, but issues such as the ongoing crisis in Syria, and the Middle East Peace Process are likely to feature prominently on the Council agenda during the Presidency. Ireland places a very strong attachment to development aid, and this is why, as Presidency, we will host a number of events in Dublin including an informal Ministerial meeting and an international conference in Dublin, bringing together the themes of hunger, nutrition and climate justice, working in close cooperation with Mary Robinson Foundation.  During our Presidency we will work to advance agreement with partners on the EU approach to the post-2015 framework for international development as we look beyond the 2000 Millennium Development Goals<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>  Work on preparing for the Presidency is now entering its final weeks.  While the agenda is considerable, we look forward to meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities that the Presidency presents to create a better Europe for citizens in Ireland and across Europe.  <\/p><p>I will continue to have meetings with partners from other Member States and the institutions.  During this month we are hosting visits from several high-level groups and Committees from the European Parliament to discuss our approach to the Presidency and to build on the already constructive working relations that we have with MEPs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Co-operation","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[47230\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the work his Department has done in relation to identifying further areas for north south cooperation.","asker":"1066","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>Promoting and expanding North\/South cooperation is a priority for the Government.

I have also been working with my Government colleagues in identifying further areas of North\/South economic co-operation, and actively supporting them in pursuing these with the Northern Executive.  This has been taking place both inside and outside the formal structures of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC).   Particular areas which have been identified include the agri-food sector; higher education; cooperation on reducing duplication which can ease budgetary pressures for both administrations; and conflict resolution.  My officials have been working to advance the North West Gateway Initiative, which is of particular importance to that region.  Consideration is also being given to working together to build trade links with Asian economies, especially China and India. <\/p><p>  The areas of sport and tourism are further areas where we can seek to expand cooperation.

The Council adopted strong conclusions which made clear that the EU continues to stand by the Syrian people in their courageous struggle for freedom, dignity and democracy. <\/p><p>The absolute priority remains stopping all violence and ending oppression.   The Council expressed its full support for the efforts of the UN\/Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to secure an early ceasefire and promote an overall political settlement. There was clear agreement within the Council on the necessity for the international community, including the UN Security Council and the main regional powers, to uphold their responsibilities and work alongside Special Envoy Brahimi.  While it is regrettable that his call for a pause in the fighting on the occasion of the <i>Eid al Adha<\/i>   festival was not observed on the ground, we must continue to support his efforts in pursuit of a peaceful and orderly political transition.<\/p><p>  No political solution in Syria will happen without a wide consensus among those opposing Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s oppressive rule.   The Council urged all opposition groups to set aside their differences and agree on a set of values and common objectives towards a genuine political transition.<\/p><p>  The Council also expressed deep concern concerning the spill-over effects of the crisis on neighbouring countries.   It strongly condemned the shelling by Syrian forces of Turkish territory, including the attack on the border town of Akcakale on 3 October, and warned again about the dangers of further militarisation of the conflict while calling for the flow of arms to Syria to be curbed.<\/p><p>  The rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation was also discussed.   The Council recalled the moral imperative for the international community to step up assistance to all affected populations in Syria and neighbouring countries.  Ireland, for its part, is already making a substantial contribution to humanitarian relief efforts, having provided &#8364;2.45 million in assistance to date which has been principally channelled through UNHRC, ICRC and WHO.  At the end of August, the Minister of State for Development Cooperation, Joe Costello T.D., visited Zatari refugee camp in Jordan in this connection.<\/p><p>  The Council also approved a further round of restrictive measures targeted against the Assad regime and its supporters, giving the Syrian Government&#8217;s continuing failure to end repression and to desist from waging war and inflicting horrendous suffering on its own people. <\/p><p>  While EU sanctions have been effective in increasing pressure on the regime, I nonetheless continue to believe that the most effective measure which could be taken now to end the violence in Syria would be the imposition of a comprehensive arms embargo by the UN Security Council.<\/p><p>  The European Council, which the Taoiseach attended in Brussels on 18\/19 October, also adopted brief Conclusions on Syria which essentially endorsed those adopted by the FAC on 15 October. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":192,"content":"<p>Question No. 179 answered with Question No. 177.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform","counter":193,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE02650"},{"type":"question","counter":194,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[50643\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will outline the opportunities that persons in lower grades of the Public Service have been afforded ion contributing to the reforms of the public service as sought in the Public Service Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":195,"content":"<p>The Public Service Agreement, 2010-2014 (the &ldquo;Croke Park&rdquo; Agreement) provides a framework for public service management and staff to work together to reduce the cost of delivery of public services while also maintaining or improving the quality of those services.

The Central Bank has further advised that in July 2011, it received information, which increased its concerns regarding the integrity of client investments managed by Custom House Capital Limited.  The Central Bank then decided to impose further directions on the firm and in July 2011 to seek the appointment of High Court Inspectors to investigate the affairs of the firm. <\/p><p>  An independent review of the Regulatory Regime for the Safekeeping of Client Assets was published by the Central Bank earlier this year and is available on the Central Bank website. The Central Bank has fully accepted the specific recommendations contained in this independent review and is in the process of implementing all of the necessary changes required. However, no amount of skilled supervision or enhanced audit can absolutely guarantee that determined or deliberately concealed efforts to misuse client holdings can be prevented. <\/p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that there are several existing powers in place and extensive new powers proposed to ensure adequate monitoring and early action by the Central Bank to prevent the loss of client assets as occurred in the case of Custom House Capital.<\/p><p>  I have already brought forward a very wide range of statutory powers to enable the Central Bank to deal with such an issue across the financial service sector under the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, the MiFID Regulation 2007, The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 (in respect of credit institutions) and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011, including a substantial number of new proposals for Committee Stage of the Bill.  <\/p><p>  The Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, sets out a far-reaching regime for the Central Bank to set out and enforce standards of fitness and probity across the financial service sector, including standards of honesty, integrity and ethical judgement, which apply to those in key management positions.  The Act provides for sanctions, at the discretion of the Central Bank, of suspension, or even, prohibition orders, following an investigation and due process.  In terms of addressing poor management, the code applies similar requirements in respect of skills and experience.  Regulated financial service providers who fail to uphold these standards could find themselves subject to administrative sanction, up to and including a &euro;10m fine or suspension\/removal of authorisation.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill, 2011, also sets out a number of new provisions that are relevant. The fitness and probity provisions are reinforced by the whistleblower protections proposed in the Bill, which place an onus on those performing pre-approval controlled functions to disclose information relating to offences, prescribed contraventions, and breaches of Irish financial services legislation or the destruction of evidence.<\/p><p>  The Authorised Officer powers proposed will allow the Central Bank full access to any information it needs, including the ability to question individuals and access premises.  The Central Bank will also have, for the first time, the statutory right to attend meetings of regulated financial service providers and related undertakings, where necessary.  <\/p><p>  The proposed Skilled Person powers under Part 2 of the Bill will allow for independent and objective analysis of issues within a regulated financial service providers or related undertaking, including client asset requirements.  This power has been specifically identified as important in the Central Bank&rsquo;s recent internal report on safeguarding client assets.<\/p><p>  The Bill will also give the Central Bank far-reaching powers of direction, which can be issued on grounds including where the regulated financial service provider is conducting business in such a manner as to jeopardise or prejudice monies held by or controlled by it on behalf of customers; these directions may also apply where the rights of customers are being prejudiced or jeopardised.  In such cases the Central Bank can issue very strong directions regarding the suspension of business or modifications to practices, among other things.  Such directions are enforceable through the High Court if necessary.  <\/p><p>  Furthermore, the Bill will provide the Central Bank with the power to make regulations setting out the standards to be met, and the procedures, systems and checks to be adopted, by regulated financial service providers for dealing with and holding the assets and money of customers.  This includes provisions on the safeguarding of customers&rsquo; rights, in particular in the event of insolvency; the use to which customers&rsquo; assets and money may be put; and the management of customer accounts.  Again these regulations will be enforceable through the administrative sanction procedure, as enhanced under the Bill.<\/p><p>  Committee stage of the Bill as published, will propose further regulation-making powers to the Central Bank which are specifically targeted at enabling the Central Bank to support the protection of client assets including greatly enhanced information gathering powers to allow the Central Bank to ensure that it can demand information from regulated firms.  These powers should facilitate investigations on compliance with client assets requirements.<\/p><p>  The Bill also proposes a means of restitution, via a Central Bank application to the High Court, where a person has been unjustly enriched or where others have suffered loss or other adverse effects arising from the commission of an offence or a prescribed contravention.  This provision is proposed to be further enhanced at Committee Stage in a way which will make it applicable to managers who commit offences or prescribed contraventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE03800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE03850"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[49406\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300061#WRE03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if following media coverage (details supplied) of the activities of debt management companies, legislation to control same or bring such companies under Central Bank regulation is being considered,; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to having in place an effective regulatory\/supervisory system for those firms which provide a debt management and\/or a debt advice service.

As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself. These are the directors so called fiduciary responsibilities. To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010. It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act. <\/p><p>  Accordingly, public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.

These rules include reference to defined benefit pension deficits as these can affect the capital base of regulated entities.    In a letter from the Financial Regulator to industry in 2005, banks were informed that those applying IAS 19\/FRS 17 are allowed to add back to Tier 1 Capital the amount of the defined benefit pension liability that has accrued in relation to Irish pension schemes in their financial statements and to deduct an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Deficit under the Minimum Funding Requirement plus (ii) three years Supplementary Contributions.  A subsequent letter issued by the Financial Regulator in 2009 amended the treatment of the Deficit under the Minimum Funding Requirement element such that credit institutions were required to include at least the Minimum Funding Requirement in its calculation of pension risk under Pillar 2 capital calculations.<\/p><p>  The draft Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) requires the removal of most prudential filters, including the Irish DB scheme pension filter detailed above. Article 461 of the draft CRR, relating to transitional provisions, provides for regulated entities to apply a phased approach to filters and deductions &ldquo;required under national transposition measures for Articles 57, 61, 63, 63a and 66 of Directive 2006\/48\/EC&rdquo; with a five year implementation period. The transitional provisions are the subject of on-going negotiation between the European Parliament (EP) and Council. <\/p><p>  The capital base and capital requirements of the PCAR banks were assessed under PCAR and included in this assessment was forecast deductions for defined benefit pension deficits and subsequent capital filters under base and stress scenarios. The FMP report did not disclose details of the assumed levels of deduction for pension deficits. The focus on the PCAR was the forecast income, capital requirements and losses (particularly loan losses) in the three-year period.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank included in the PCAR the forecast deduction for defined benefit pension deficits and subsequent capital filters under base and stress scenarios. In addition the Central Bank considered the implications of Basel III (namely CRD IV\/ CRR). The PCAR tolerance levels and capital basis were set in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s definition of Core Tier 1 under the prevailing Capital Requirements Directive rules as at end-March 2011.<\/p><p>  It is important to note, that the quality of capital in the Irish banking system has increased significantly as a result of lower tier capital buy backs and Government equity contributions. Whilst it is clear that the Basel III rules impose more conservative deductions than is currently the case, following a recapitalisation to levels determined by the 2011 PCAR, the FMP report stated that all four banks should comfortably meet Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a phase-in basis under both the base case and stress case scenarios. The combined surplus to the minimum phase-in Common Equity Tier 1 under the PCAR base case under PCAR was estimated at the time as circa 13.3bn and 3.7bn under the stress case. Three of the banks would also meet the full 2019 minimum standard in the 2013 base case scenario. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300062#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":273,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[49494\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300062#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in respect of the &euro;1.1billion top-up made by Allied Irish Banks to the group pension scheme in August 2012, if he will estimate the capital value needed by a pension fund in order to make an annual payment of &euro;529,000 to a scheme member, as is reportedly the case with annual payments to the former chief executive officer of AIB, Mr Eugene Sheehy.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the transfer of assets to the pension fund earlier this year was undertaken in order to facilitate the early retirement component of the voluntary severance program of the bank.

Illegal activity in this area, particularly the criminal activity associated with laundering marked fuel, imposes significant costs on the community and poses a serious threat to tax yield and to legitimate businesses.  As part of its strategy to curb illegal activity in this area, earlier this year Revenue introduced strengthened licensing requirements for traders in auto fuels and a new licensing requirement for traders in marked fuel oil from 1 October 2012. In addition, from January 2013, there will be a new requirement for all fuel traders to make monthly returns of oil movements.  These requirements are considered essential in protecting legitimate traders and curbing illegal activity. The licence fee is a flat rate excise duty of &#8364;250 and it applies to traders licensed to keep, deliver, deal in or sell marked fuel and auto fuel in respect of each premises from which they operate. This rate has not changed since 2001.  <\/p><p>  Revenue has had a number of meetings with trade representatives to explain the new licensing procedures and reporting requirements.  These representative organisations have indicated their support for these initiatives, recognising their role in tackling fuel fraud and tax evasion and addressing the concerns of compliant traders who face unfair competition from illicit traders.  In designing the new system, Revenue was conscious of the potential compliance burden on traders, particularly small traders, and the new reporting requirements, for example, allow for aggregate reporting of marked fuel deliveries to domestic users. Revenue has communicated with traders to explain the new system and has published detailed information on its website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.revenue.ie<\/font><\/i>.  I am assured by Revenue that the new monthly return (ROM1) is relatively straightforward and that they have scheduled a series of seminars for traders throughout November to explain how the new system will work in practice and to clarify any queries they may have.<\/p><p>  The laundering of marked fuel and its subsequent sale to motorists through retail outlets and other means is a serious, multi-faceted problem with significant consequences for the exchequer, legitimate traders, unsuspecting motorists and the environment. Trading in marked fuel, which is taxed at a lower rate than road fuel on condition that it is used only for specified off-road activities, carries certain responsibilities. As Minister for Finance, I fully support the comprehensive set of measures being implemented by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure more effective control of the distribution of road fuels and marked fuels, including the new licensing requirements and the new electronic reporting system for oil movements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300064#WRH02700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":340,"content":"<p>Question No. 234 answered with Question No. 201.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Liquor Licences","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300064#WRH02850"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[49741\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300064#WRH02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of licensed premises in the State; the number of pubs and the turnover breakdown of these pubs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the statistics provided below relate to Liquor Licences issued for the sale of liquor in the state up to 30th September 2012. &ldquo;Off&rdquo; Licences are issued either singularly such as &ldquo;Wine Retailer&rsquo;s Off Licence&rdquo; or in combinations such as Spirits and\/or beer, and\/or wine. &ldquo;Off&rdquo; licences can also be issued in combination with Wholesale Dealer licences.

The strategy employed by Revenue to tackle this illicit trade is multi-faceted: it includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.<\/p><p>  Revenue also carries out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations.  Revenue both provides and receives intelligence from other Customs Administrations and works closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in its efforts to tackle the illicit sale of tobacco at an international level.  This international cooperation and sharing of intelligence and expertise plays an important role in combating illegal tobacco smuggling on a global basis.<\/p><p>  In 2010 and 2011 seizures of cigarettes were, respectively, 178.4 million and 109.1 million.  Seizures of other tobacco products in those years were 3,367 kilograms (2010) and 11,158 kilograms (2011). Seizures to date in 2012 amount to 91.4 million cigarettes and 4,041 kilograms of tobacco.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their office and the Tobacco Control Unit of the Department of Health commissioned surveys in 2009, 2010 and 2011 to establish the level of the illicit trade in tobacco.  The surveys for 2009 and 2010 estimated that 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction.  This figure was further broken down as 14% illicit product and 6% legally imported by passengers arriving into the State from other jurisdictions.  These findings were based on the 2006 Census population figures.  By applying the most up to date population data, the 2011 census population figures, which have recently become available, IPSOS MRBI have now revised the illicit percentages to 16% for 2009 and 15% for 2010.  The recently published results from the IPSOS MRBI survey for 2011 indicate that illicit consumption accounted for 15% of the market. <\/p><p>  The illegal trade in tobacco products is a serious threat to the Exchequer and to legitimate businesses and the Deputy can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners will continue their extensive work against smugglers and sellers of illicit products.  My Department will continue to liaise closely with Revenue on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300065#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Universal Social Charge","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300065#WRJ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[50075\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300065#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in the Budget 2013, if he plans any changes to the Universal Social Charge for Deeds of Covenant as it relates to permanently incapacitated minors, in order to remove them from liability to pay the charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":380,"content":"<p>It is also a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300065#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[50076\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300065#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money that was collected from the Universal Social Charge from Deeds of Covenant in respect of permanently incapacitated minors in 2011 and to date 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1013","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":383,"content":"<p>The position is that both income tax and Universal Social Charge (USC) are chargeable where a permanently incapacitated minor child is in receipt of income by virtue of a deed of covenant from a person who is not his or her parent.

Some 66 grant awarding authorities were involved, all using a variety of application, assessment and payment processes.  Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) replaces all of these with a centralised, and on-line system of application. The centralisation of the service enables the introduction of service level improvements on an incremental basis, which heretofore was difficult given the number of agencies involved. An example of this is that all new student grants approved for this academic year will be paid by electronic funds transfer on a monthly basis directly to students' bank accounts, rather than by cheque to the relevant college. The introduction of the on-line application is an enormous improvement on the cumbersome paper-based application form that preceded it.  By introducing devices such as drop-down menus, compulsory fields and individual-relevant questions, it has ensured a much higher level of quality of completion at that part of the process.<\/p><p>  However, I understand from SUSI that what it could not have anticipated was the level of incorrect or incomplete supporting documentation subsequently submitted in support of applications.  This has created bottlenecks in the system which SUSI is currently dealing with. My Department is ensuring that it has the resources and personnel to do so. Payments to new students commenced on the 19th October and will continue on a weekly rolling basis as grants are approved and bank details are supplied online by the student to ensure that students receive their payments as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  A full review of the first year of operation of the grants system as operated by SUSI, a unit of City of Dublin VEC is planned in advance of the opening up of the application process for the 2013\/14 academic year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300066#WRK01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300066#WRK01450"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[49642\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300066#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding scooter user access for students who need to use scooters to get into lecture halls at a university (details supplied) but are finding it almost impossible to access their lecture theatres on their scooters; the steps that have been taken by the university to ensure that all students can attend the university regardless of disability and the plans they have to enable scooter users to access their lecture theatres without the present difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":448,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[49643\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300066#WRK01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding scooter user access for students who need to use scooters to get into the student accommodation at a university (details supplied) but are finding it almost impossible to access the student accommodation on their scooters; the steps that have been taken by the university to ensure that all students can access the student accommodation at the university regardless of disability and the plans they have to enable scooter users to access their accommodation without the present difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1104","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":449,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 and 271 together.  <\/p><p>  The matters raised by the Deputy fall within the responsibilities of the Governing Authority of the University to deal with. <\/p><p>  In this regard the Disability Act 2005 requires that all public bodies ensure that public buildings are, as far as practicable, made accessible to people with disabilities not later than 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300066#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts","counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300066#WRK01750"},{"type":"question","counter":451,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[49650\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300066#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the amount currently being spent on, or budgeted for by State agencies under his remit for spending, on the areas of communication, public relations, consultancy, advertising and human resources; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":452,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of agencies is not held centrally by my Department.

No. 418\/2011 - Finance (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2011, personal property and land vested in or held in trust by a body corporate immediately prior to its dissolution (other than personal property or land held by such body upon trust for another person) becomes property of the State in the person of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform until such time as the company is restored to the Register or the Minister waives (under Section 31 of the Act) the interest vested in him.  This mechanism acts as a fail-safe so that property is never ownerless.<\/p><p>  The interest acquired by the Minister is described as a defeasible interest as it may be defeated by restoration of the company.  Neither company nor property law require comprehensive and fully up-to-date asset records to be lodged with the Company Registration Office and the Property Registration Authority.  Consequently, the only persons with a complete view of the assets held by a company at the time of its dissolution are the directors and officers of the company.  As a result, the Minister only becomes aware that assets have vested in him by virtue of the State Property Act once he has been notified by an interested party.  Administration of matters relating to real estate is delegated to the Office of Public Works.<\/p><p>  The outcome of the situation described above is that the Minister\/OPW can only become aware of properties that vest in the Minister when applicants write seeking a waiver in relation to a particular property and provide evidence of the properties vesting in the Minister. Even in such situations, information may only be made available on a particular property which may have vested in the Minister and information on further properties may not be made available.  Furthermore, even though a company may be dissolved, the properties held by the company may not necessarily vest in the Minister, for example, they could be held on trust.  Where no applications for waivers are received in relation to particular companies dissolving, no information is available on properties which could vest in the Minister.<\/p><p>  Section 31 of the State Property Act, 1954 permits the Minister to divest himself of property which devolved to the State under Section 28(2).  Upon receipt of an application, the Minister may waive the right of the State to such property as he thinks proper having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  In general, the Minister will waive his interest in any such property where it is established that the applicant has a moral or quasi-moral right to the property in question.  Where common interests apply, for example in the case of roads in housing estates, the Minister generally waives in favour of the relevant local authority.  Notwithstanding the power to waive, it must be remembered that the primary mechanism available to the directors and beneficial owners of a company to regain control of their property is to restore the company to the register.  In support of the legal policy underpinning the Companies Acts, the policy in relation to waivers is that the Minister does not waive in favour of the former directors of the dissolved company.<\/p><p>  Bearing all these matters in mind, a list setting out details on the lines requested by the Deputy is currently in preparation and will be forwarded to him by the Office of Public Works as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":561,"content":"<p>Question No. 315 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRM01650"},{"type":"question","counter":563,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[49403\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRM01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the cost of establishing the Ireland Stat website; the number of staff allocated to its running and their salaries; the annual cost of running this website; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":564,"content":"<p><i>Ireland Stat<\/i> is a new initiative to provide simple and clear information about how Ireland is performing by reference to well-specified indicators across the broad range of governmental activity. It is part of the Government&#8217;s modernisation of presenting information on how public money is spent, allocated and accounted for and is a natural development of the Performance Budgeting initiative that was rolled out to almost all Departments at the start of this year and published in the Estimates document in February. These initiatives set expenditure in the context of Departments&#8217; strategic goals, as set out in their Statements of Strategy, and present performance information, both in terms of actions and impacts, alongside the financial and human resources information that was already included in the Estimates.  Both the Performance Budgeting initiative and <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> meet the Programme for Government commitment for greater accountability and transparency and build performance information into the heart of the budgetary process.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, these initiatives represent a considerable streamlining of information and reporting of what Government Departments and Agencies are doing and achieving with public money. In particular, Performance Budgeting replaces the requirement to produce Annual Output Statements, a process that involved a degree of administrative burden on Departments and Offices as they had to reshape how information was presented in the Estimates to match the structure of their Statements of Strategy. There is now a single, coherent way of presenting the complex array of information that relates to each specific policy programme.<\/p><p>  As I have already noted, the development of <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> is very much part of my Department&#8217;s ongoing work on the Performance Budgeting initiative and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> initiative was in the main developed using the skills and knowledge of the officials in my Department. The technical aspects of the <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> development were managed in-house using internal Systems Development expertise. There are no staff allocated whole-time to running <i>Ireland Stat<\/i>: a small team from the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit, part of the newly established Irish Government Economic &amp; Evaluation Service, were involved in the selection of the indicators and the overall website structure, as one element of their broader work programme, in close liaison with colleagues working on the overall programme of public sector reform. Their work has been informed by international best practice in this area.

This spending pattern is in line with trends from previous years which show that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the last quarter of the year.<\/p><p>  The potential for end year savings is dependent also on the decisions which will be taken shortly in relation to capital carryover. The capital carryover facility is an arrangement under which Departments are permitted to carryover unspent capital (up to 10% of their allocation) into the following year. This facility is an integral part of the rolling multi-annual capital system. The carryover facility means that moneys which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital can now be made available for spending on programme priorities in the following year.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the profiling of capital expenditure is carried out by individual Departments on the basis of the likely timing of payments related to capital projects and programmes which they deliver. Job creation is not a factor of the profiling exercise. However, job creation and labour intensity of individual projects are factors that are taken into account when deciding on the allocation of capital to Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRM02250"},{"type":"question","counter":571,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[49587\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"how well funded all semi-State company pension schemes are; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":572,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question each Department is responsible for providing pension fund details in relation to commercial semi State companies for which they hold responsibility.<\/p><p>  In relation to An Post National Lottery Company which comes under the aegis of my Department I wish to inform the Deputy that pay and pensions issues are a matter for An Post.

Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills and labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as health care, information technology and financial services.<\/p><p>  Ireland has to compete with other countries for migrant labour, particularly in respect of high-level skills. Skills required in the high-tech sectors are in demand and in short supply globally. While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is the most sustainable way forward in the long term, in the short term, there continues to be a need to supplement Ireland&rsquo;s skills stock through employment permits and to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s employment permits system is geared towards attracting such skills.<\/p><p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the implementation of policy in relation to the admission of non-EEA nationals to the State and their residence in the State.  However, the employment permit regime provides for control of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market as well as powers for enforcement of employment rights. Deputies will be only too aware that economic migrants are a vulnerable class of people. Therefore, any actions affecting inward economic migration should be cognisant of the need to ensure that such migrants are protected and made aware of their employment rights.<\/p><p>  The Employment Permits regime is supporting the enterprise sector and significant levels of applications are successful particularly those based on high skills levels. Figures indicate: a reduction in total applications in line with economic circumstances, but an increase in Green Card applications, in line with a greater emphasis on high value skills; and an increase in the proportion of applications in respect of ICT job roles with applications in respect of ICT job roles being more successful than the norm. Over 90% of ICT related applications are successful and over 1,000 ICT related applications have been approved so far this year.  My Department has reviewed its processes with a view to attracting more ICT related applications and is confident that significant improvements can be made shortly which will greatly enhance the employment permits regime, for example, in conjunction with Forf&aacute;s, a review is underway of the Green Card Employment Permit Scheme which is used by Ireland to meet labour market requirements where skills shortages have been identified by reference to analyses undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. An interim review of the four core employment permit types - Green Cards, Intra-Company Transfers, Work Permits and Spousal\/Dependents - is being conducted with a view to improving the throughput and quality of employment permit applications. Such an initiative would favour the ICT sector in particular as it would include a streamlining of the documentary process, a reduction in the time it takes for applicants to prepare a successful application, and a significant reduction in processing times.  Closer interactions are being cultivated with the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to providing a more coherent service across the employment permit regime and visa regime including policy convergence, greater information sharing and unified communications from both Departments in respect of labour market access.  I intend to announce a range of improvements in this regard shortly.<\/p><p>  It is also the Government&rsquo;s ambition that Ireland should take advantage of the opportunities for employment in the ICT sector and that every opportunity is afforded to our graduates and unemployed to prepare them with the skills required to work in that sector. Employment Permits are but one way of increasing the level of ICT skills available in the labour market. Building Ireland&rsquo;s ICT skills capability will require improving the domestic output of skilled ICT graduates and my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills has already put in place plans to establish an overarching target of doubling the annual output from honours degree ICT undergraduate programmes to 2,000 graduates by 2018.  These plans involve actions to: increase the domestic supply of honours degree graduates in the short term through expansion of conversion; and boost the longer term supply and quality of graduates from the higher education system.<\/p><p>  Finally, work is also proceeding with regard to the preparation of new employment permits legislation which will provide for more flexibility and targeted instruments in support of the economy&rsquo;s evolving skills needs.

The EU Framework Programmes have been an important element in the internationalisation of Irish research, offering Ireland's SMEs, multinationals, and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts.  FP7 is built largely around collaborative research (Cooperation) and mobility of researchers (People).  However, it also contains a number of innovative elements, the most important of which is &ldquo;Ideas&rdquo; which provides the funding for the European Research Council. <\/p><p>  In order for Ireland to extract the maximum benefit from the opportunities available within FP7, a National Support Network has been put in place, headed by a National Director for FP7 based in Enterprise Ireland who leads a team of national contact points for various elements of the Programme.  This support structure ensures that a coordinated and coherent approach is adopted towards FP7 across all of the Government Departments, agencies and other organisations involved.  Through this support structure, a mix of guidance, advice and financial assistance is available to encourage researchers and companies, large and small, to avail of the opportunities within the Programme. <\/p><p>  In the period from the beginning of 2007 when the Seventh Framework Programme began to June this year, the latest period for which data is available, almost 6,000 applicants from Irish based organisations took part in FP7 proposals requesting European funding.  Of these, almost 1400 applicants have been successful, giving an overall Irish success rate of over 23%.  Funding awards to Irish participants to date is &euro;438 million, covering a period of five and a half years.  <\/p><p>  Five areas account for 65% of the funding: Information &amp; Communication Technologies (&euro;89.5 million); Health (&euro;64 million); Marie Curie (Mobility Programme) (&euro;62 million); Nanoscience, Nanotechnology, Materials &amp; Production Processes (&euro;38 million); and European Research Council (&euro;34 million).<\/p><p>  Agrifood (&euro;28m), Research for the Benefit of SMEs (&euro;26m), Security (&euro;18m), Transport (&euro;17m), Energy (&euro;16.5m), Research Infrastructures (&euro;16.5m), Environment (&euro;14m), Science in Society (&euro;7.5m), Space (&euro;2.7m) and Socio-Economic Sciences &amp; Humanities (&euro;2.4m) follow, while other areas have resulted in funding of less than &euro;1 million per area to date. <\/p><p>  Based on recent national investment in research, Ireland is participating in the Framework Programme from a far stronger position than ever before.  A critical mass of research activity has developed in both the public and private sectors, and the design of FP7 suits the needs of Irish researchers in many ways.  It has been adapted to encourage industry participation, the application process has been simplified, industry-specific targets have been set and higher funding rates have been agreed.  The high level of activity of Irish researchers (academic and industry) and the Irish success rate ahead of the overall EU average are very positive indications of our strong participation in FP7.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":607,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRN00550"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[49863\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps he is taking to support small rural shops and businesses in County Meath; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&#8217;s plans for jobs and growth.  That is why the Government has decided to implement an ambitious reform in the delivery of service to small and micro business.  This will include: Development of a new Small and Micro Business Division within Enterprise Ireland (EI) as a centre of excellence in the provision of supports to the small and micro enterprise sectors; Dissolution of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs), and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI); Establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to provide a high quality, innovative, &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; support service for small businesses within Local Authorities, and providing early access to the services of national bodies; and Integration of key local authority business services into the Local Enterprise Office and promotion of a local environment in which enterprise can thrive.<\/p><p>  A high level Implementation Working Group (IWG) chaired by my Department is currently progressing the range of issues involved, including a focus on functions, structures and staffing, all of which will form the basis of a detailed and ambitious Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities.

The Fund is open to entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs of all ages, across the country. <\/p><p>  Microfinance Ireland, (MFI), the company set up to operate the Fund, is  working closely with the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland and are very conscious of the particular difficulties entrepreneurs face with regard to credit history, previous business experience etc. and where they can assist entrepreneurs, they will do so.  However, the potential viability of the business proposal is the dominant factor in any credit decision made by Microfinance Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 also includes a number of specific measures aimed at supporting employment in the retail sector including: a renewed focus on prompt payments to business; an assessment of the potential for future development of the retail sector; the introduction of a Statutory Code of Practice for Grocery Goods; and the acceleration of the programme of revaluation of commercial premises which will provide a basis for the adjustment in commercial rates.  My officials and I meet with representatives of the retail sector to hear the challenges they face.

The Reform Programme will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. <\/p><p>  The Workplace Relations Reform Programme Office was established in September 2011 in order to progress the Reform Programme and to date substantial progress has already been made with a number of important priority actions that were identified by the Minister having been successfully delivered within the target timescale. <\/p><p>  The Programme Office is conscious of the importance of effective communications with staff under what is a major change management initiative.  In this regard, the Programme Office has engaged extensively with all staff that has been affected by the Reform Programme including staff members that are serving in the lower grades of the public service.  A number of specific measures have been introduced in this regard, including: <\/p><p>Project Teams, comprising representation from all Workplace Relations Bodies, have been employed to progress all reform initiatives (Single Contact Portal, Website, Complaint Form and ERS).  Membership of these Teams is open to all grades. EAT, LRC, NERA, Labour Court and Equality Tribunal representatives on Project Teams are required to keep their respective staff (at all levels) apprised of developments under the Reform Programme.  <\/p><p>The Director of the Workplace Relations Reform and Liaison has held a number of briefing sessions directly with staff of the Bodies.  He also gave briefings to the Departmental Council and Partnership Committees of DJEI and the Partnership Committee of the Equality Tribunal.<\/p><p>The Programme Office is working directly with the relevant staff of the Workplace Relations Bodies as part of a major review of business processes.

It will be 2014 before the reform is fully complete and the long-term staffing requirements of the WRC and the Labour Court are in place.<\/p><p>  The Department has recognised that it is very important to consult and work with staff and their representatives to provide as smooth a transition as possible through the process.  In this regard, a Consultation Paper entitled the Proposed Staffing of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court was circulated to all staff in August, 2012.  Feedback on this document was facilitated by, among other means, a series of meetings during September and October with all the staff of the Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Consultation Paper was also circulated to the unions representing staff.  Taking into account any feedback received it is intended to produce a Structures and Staffing Plan for the new WRC and Labour Court in November, 2012.  The plan will be made available to the Workplace Relations Implementation Group and various stakeholders when finalised.<\/p><p>  As can be seen from the foregoing there has been extensive consultation with staff within the existing Workplace Relations Bodies in relation to the all aspects of the Reform programme.  The objective is to ensure maximum engagement with all staff as the reforms progress and to ensure that all staff, including those serving in the lower grades, have had the opportunity to make a meaningful and valuable input into the Reform Project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRN01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance Fund","counter":616,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":617,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[50032\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will consider introducing a third higher band of employer PRSI contributions on salaries of &euro;100,000 or more; if she will outline the net effect that she believes such a policy would have on both revenue generated and employment; her views on the unusually small contribution which social security taxes make to Irish Government revenues when compared to other European countries; her views on whether there is scope to increase rates on higher incomes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":618,"content":"<p>I am most concerned about the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and one of my key goals is to reform the system of social protection and to put it on a sounder financial footing for the future.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 89,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 89,000 additional clients, the landlords.

I have no proposals to alter the arrangements in place either for the selection of participants, the duration of their engagement or the eligibility requirements relating to the recruitment to supervisory or team leader position.  <\/p><p>  I consider the engagement of 12-months to be adequate to meet the objectives of the initiative and to provide these work placement opportunities to as many of those on the live register.

Following profiling and interview, the Implementing Body identifies the type of work placement most suited to the participant&rsquo;s skills and needs and matches the participant to the available positions offered by the community, voluntary and not-for-profit sector locally.

In the first case, where a social welfare claimant is in receipt of maintenance payments from a spouse\/partner, housing costs incurred by the social welfare claimant (e.g. rent or mortgage payments and\/or home improvement loan) up to a maximum of &euro;95.23 per week may be offset against the maintenance payment, with half the balance of the maintenance being assessed as means. These arrangements ensure that there is always an incentive to receive a maintenance payment.<\/p><p>  In the second case, where a social welfare claimant is paying maintenance to another person, whether on a voluntary basis or on foot of a Court order, their means for social welfare purposes are their means before they meet any obligations they may have to pay maintenance i.e. no account is taken of such payments in assessing the means of the maintenance payer. Thus, for example, in the event of the payer having income from employment or self-employment, the income from these sources is assessed without regard to any maintenance paid to another person. If maintenance payments were taken into account, any reduction in these means as a consequence of maintenance payments to another person would, in effect, result in the welfare system subsidizing or possibly fully meeting these payments. <\/p><p>  Where a person has maintenance obligations on foot of a Court order and they find that they can no longer afford to meet those obligations, for example because their circumstances have changed, it is open to that person to seek to have the Court review the order in light of their changed income position. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRP04900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":763,"content":"<p>Question No. 392 answered with Question No. 375.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":764,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRP05100"},{"type":"question","counter":765,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[50004\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRP05200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an application for carer's allowance was received in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; when a decision may be expected; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":766,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 22\/12\/11.

This can be done through a number of mechanisms including statistical transfer and joint projects.<\/p><p>  I have met on several occasions over the past twelve months with the then UK Energy Minister Hendry and with Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey.  The meetings covered a number of issues including the prospect for renewable electricity trading between the jurisdictions in the context of the framework provided by the Renewable Energy Directive.<\/p><p>  Exploring renewable trade was already agreed at a high level at the 2011 June British Irish Council summit and had been progressed in the interim at the British Irish Council working group level.<\/p><p>  In June this year at a meeting in London with Minister Hendry, both sides agreed to work towards concluding a Memorandum of Understanding around the end of the year which will be an important step in relation to the proposition of cross border renewable trade between the two jurisdictions.  This was further progressed at my most recent meeting with Secretary of State Ed Davey on 20 September following the official launch of the East West Interconnector.<\/p><p>  Increased interconnection between the two islands offers Irish developers the prospect of being able to access a much larger electricity market.  The electricity market in GB is around ten times the scale of the electricity market in Ireland.  In the short term there are opportunities for on and offshore wind and biomass projects, but in the medium to longer term as technologies mature and become commercially deployable, there will also be opportunities for wave and tidal developers.<\/p><p>  There are currently a number of potential project developers that have expressed interest in renewable export.  Several of these developers have met with me to indicate their interest in developing the business of renewable electricity exporters.  These developers have also underlined to me the need to progress the bilateral discussions with the UK.<\/p><p>  In developing the Memorandum of Understanding, officials from both sides are examining a range of issues around the electricity market, regulatory and technical grid areas to underpin the creation of cross jurisdictional renewable electricity trade.  We are working to develop the terms of such an agreement in a way which ensures a mutually beneficial arrangement with the UK and to ensure tangible economic benefits for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRS01100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hydraulic Fracturing Policy","counter":883,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRS01150"},{"type":"question","counter":884,"qnumday":434,"qnumall":"[50086\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has developed the terms of reference and the parameters for further research to be commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency later this year on the issue of hydraulic fracturing here; if the terms of reference for this more extensive research is to be drawn up by a steering group; the organisations that will be represented on this group other than the EPA and his Department; the time frame for the publication of this report, and the further explorative activity that the companies licensed by his Department can undertake between now and the publication of this report.","asker":"1082","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":885,"content":"<p>The terms of reference for the second and more detailed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) research are currently being drawn up by a steering group, which includes representatives from the EPA, Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, Department of Environment, Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Commission for Energy Regulation, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and my Department including the Office of the Geological Survey of Ireland.

The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the Household Charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the Household Charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.<\/p><p>  General Purpose Grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in General Purpose Grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce General Purpose Grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of this year in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the Household Charge. As such, if collected in full, the Household Charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 9 November 2012 some &euro;109m had been collected nationally. A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 General Purpose Grant payment. For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total General Purpose Grant allocation for 2012. <\/p><p>  I am keeping the income generated from the Household Charge under constant review and those local authorities that achieve a collection rate of 65% or above will suffer no further reduction in their General Purpose Grant allocation for 2012. However, it is up to individual local authorities to address any potential funding shortfalls arising from non-compliance with the legislation and to pursue those who may have a liability and initiate court proceedings, where it is considered appropriate. Non-compliance by liable owners does, however, result in reduced resources for local authorities to support communities and this places a greater burden on those owners who do pay the Charge.<\/p><p>  I am confident that the level of General Purpose Grants, together with other Government grants and subsidies and income raised from local sources, is appropriate to meet the costs of providing a reasonable level of local authority services to communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRS03300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Charge","counter":915,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRS03350"},{"type":"question","counter":916,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[49617\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRS03400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the properties registered for the household charge to date; the number that have been registered by persons who registered two or more properties and the number of persons that have registered two or more properties for the household charge.","asker":"954","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":917,"content":"<p>The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service\/agency basis for all county and city councils.

The Household Charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge. Having done so, I consider that a liable owner has discharged his or her primary responsibilities under the Act.   <\/p><p>There was no existing comprehensive database of residential properties and their owners within the State prior to the Household Charge being introduced. The collection of the Household Charge via self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property and will be an essential component for implementing the   Local Property Tax. Local authorities are continuing to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions, and significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other datasets and in refining the resulting data.   <\/p><p>I understand that the addresses and names used in the recent batch of letters which have been   issued by Local Authorities reminding people to pay the Household Charge have been based on a data matching exercise with the Property Registration Authority. <\/p><p>I also understand that every effort has been made to try and ensure letters are sent to current property owners. However there are some instances where letters are being sent to previous owners of properties, due to the fact that the more recent property owners may not have registered their property with the Authority or the transfer of the property has not been completed. Thus in some cases the information contained within these datasets may not reflect the most recent and relevant details. As a consequence, the data matching exercise can give rise to situations in which people may receive a letter where they have already paid the Charge. Due to differences in the formats of addresses between datasets, it has also been the case that some owners who have paid the Charge are receiving reminder letters.   <\/p><p>In other instances, letters have unfortunately been sent to deceased persons. I appreciate that receipt of such a letter may cause upset to relatives of a deceased person. However, in the absence of a comprehensive database, such instances, while regrettable, are also unavoidable if the Agency and local authorities are to continue their work in maximising compliance with a charge which funds essential local services for communities. <\/p><p>I understand that the letters which issued in recent weeks invite recipients who are not liable, or who have previously paid the household charge, or in the event of inaccuracy or error, to contact the Household Charge Bureau to allow the Agency to update their records accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRT01200","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff","counter":949,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRT01250"},{"type":"question","counter":950,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[49810\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRT01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide in a tabular form, a breakdown of the the total remuneration packages including pay, allowances such as travel and expenses, and contractual pension arrangements for each of the four Dublin local authorities city and county managers; and if he will provide the same remuneration details for all heads of Departments\/senior managers of each of the local authorities.","asker":"1008","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":951,"content":"<p>The salaries of the managers in Dublin local authorities are set in the context of manager salaries more broadly.

It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors, particularly in the context of the island of Ireland by facilitating visitors to travel freely between Northern Ireland and Ireland without the need for a separate Irish or UK visa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":1001,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRU00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1002,"qnumday":475,"qnumall":"[49464\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding an application for Irish citizenship in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1003,"content":"<p>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in May, 2011.

The word \"hatred\" is defined as \"hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation\". The State's prosecutorial authorities have not brought to my notice any difficulties in bringing prosecutions under the 1989 Act.<\/p><p>  In addition to the foregoing legislation, where criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage, or public order offences are committed with a racist motive, they are prosecuted as generic offences though the wider criminal law. The trial judge can take aggravating factors, including racial motivation, into account at sentencing.<\/p><p>  A review of the 1989 Act was concluded in December, 2008 with the publication of research entitled &quot;Combating Racism and Xenophobia through the Criminal Law&quot; by the Centre for Criminal Justice, University of Limerick.  The research was commissioned by the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism and the National Action Plan Against Racism steering group.<\/p><p>  The report made only one recommendation regarding the criminal law - the introduction of racially aggravated sentencing. It stated that changes in the criminal law would be insufficient by themselves to address racism. The authors commented that it was clearly established, at both the national and international level, that greater dividends would ensue from more substantial investment in social and education measures.<\/p><p>  The introduction of racially aggravated sentencing would involve a restructuring of penalties for basic criminal offences (assault or criminal damage, for example) to increase sentences, and have wider implications for the criminal law. There are numerous other factors which can be considered aggravating.<\/p><p>  In this jurisdiction, the legislature enacts criminal laws which usually provide for maximum penalties in the form of a fine or imprisonment, or both. In general, there are no statutory sentencing guidelines.  Within our legislative framework, the determination of penalty in any individual case is largely a matter for the trial judge, taking case law, including appealed cases, into account.  This allows the courts to take all the circumstances of the offence and all the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors into account.  The gravity of the offence, the facts surrounding the commission of the offence, the criminal record of the accused and the impact on the victim are among the critical factors taken into account before a sentence is imposed.  The judge must take into account the circumstances of the offence and the offender. Moreover, the Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal against the sentence imposed if she believes it to be unduly lenient.<\/p><p>  In all the circumstances, I have no plans, at present, for legislative initiatives in relation to hate crime.

When complete, this assessment will be submitted to the Attorney General for her consideration. I am informed that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will not be in a position to outline his intentions as regards ratification of the Convention until this process is complete. <\/p><p>  My Department is working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others such as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to implementing additional procedures for the employment of private domestic workers in diplomatic households. The purpose of the additional procedures are, taking account of international best practice, to provide for  employment terms and conditions for domestic workers in diplomatic households that demonstrate respect for Irish laws and good employment practice.<\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of forced labour, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which came into effect on 7 June 2008 criminalises the trafficking of persons for the purposes of labour exploitation. Section 1 of the 2008 Act defines labour exploitation in relation to a person (including a child) as follows: (a) subjecting the person to forced labour; (b) forcing him or her to render services to another, or (c) enslavement of the person or subjecting him or her to servitude or a similar condition or state.<\/p><p>  For the purposes of the Act, the term &quot;trafficks&quot; is broadly defined; for example, the commission of an offence does not require cross border movement or illegal entry into the State. It includes recruitment; taking a person into one's custody, care or charge; and providing the person with accommodation or employment. Officials in my Department will shortly be submitting to me a report providing an analysis of whether the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 is sufficient to cover all circumstances in which forced labour could occur and I will be considering this Report in the near future.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that, normally, an <i>au pair<\/i> arrangement is a private, voluntary arrangement between the parties concerned - a private household or sponsor family and a private individual &#8211; on the basis of a shared understanding.  Although circumstances can differ from case to case, an <i>&#8220;au pair&#8221;<\/i> is assumed not to be an employee because there is no contract of employment between the householder and the person in question.  If a contract of employment does exist then this places the arrangement on a different footing.  In general, where people have concerns that employees may be exploited or receiving less than their statutory entitlement the matter should be reported to the National Employment Rights Authority for investigation. A Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&#8217;s Homes was developed by the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Act 1990 and promulgated in 2007.  The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&#8217;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question. In addition to this code of practice which applies specifically to live-in employees, it is important to note that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.  In addition, the National Employment Rights Authority has carried out a programme of inspections involving domestic workers as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from domestic workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRU02762","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Retirements","counter":1035,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRU02825"},{"type":"question","counter":1036,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[49736\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRU02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the supports in place for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who suffer from mental health issues such as anxiety and depression as a result of their work.","asker":"1066","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":1037,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[49737\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRU03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the proportion of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that retired following illness or injury on duty that were retired due to mental health issues such as anxiety or depression.","asker":"1066","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1038,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 and 487 together.<\/p><p>  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been granted ill health retirements from 1 January 2012 to 7 November 2012 was 1 Sergeant and 4 Garda&iacute;.

All options to avoid the need for personnel to relocate are being explored as part of this process.  Personnel are being offered the opportunity for reassignment within their current locations where this is feasible, together with opportunities for re-training and re-skilling.  In addition, a review system has been put in place whereby personnel who are unhappy with a proposed relocation can seek a review of a decision.  Inevitably, given the scale of the reorganisation, it will be necessary for some staff to move to new locations.  <\/p><p>  The creation of a new two Brigade structure for the Army under the reorganisation has resulted in Combat Support Units being reduced from nine units to six.  The Field Engineer companies based in McKee Barracks fall into this category, and the Headquarters element and Field Engineer Company are being relocated to Custume Barracks, Athlone.  Forty-five personnel from within the 2 Field Engineer Company will therefore have to move with their unit to Athlone, or be reassigned to alternative appointments available in other Units in the Dublin Area.  Pending the full rollout of the reorganisation plan it is not possible to say how many personnel can be facilitated though reassignment process.  However, there is no question of families being moved or being required to move arising from the reorganisation and this is a matter for each individual to decide.  The reality is that many Defence Forces personnel currently assigned to McKee barracks are not resident in Dublin and commute on a daily basis, which is a common feature across both the public and private sector of a modern, flexible and mobile working population in Ireland today.<\/p><p>  All members of the Defence Forces reassigned under the Defence Forces Reorganisation Plan 2012 are entitled to Change of Station Allowance in circumstances where they meet the qualifying criteria.  It is not possible at this point to estimate the total figure that will require to be paid in Change of Station allowance as this will be contingent on a number of factors including whether individuals will actually opt to physically relocate home or not. <\/p><p>  The Government is very much aware that the major re-organisation currently underway is a difficult process for many serving members of the Defence Forces and their families, who are being required to make decisions under the current reorganisation that they would not otherwise have to make, or in different times have had to consider.  Unfortunately, this is the consequence and reality of the reforms necessarily taking place across the public service today.  It must be reiterated that there is no painless way to fundamentally reorganise the Defence Forces whilst maintaining essential military capabilities and it has become necessary to mandatorily move some personnel whose units are being disestablished or relocated and who cannot be accommodated in their current location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRV03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Reform","counter":1115,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1116,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[50640\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will outline the opportunities that persons in lower grades of the Public Service have been afforded ion contributing to the reforms of the public service as sought in the Public Service Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1117,"content":"<p>The Department of Defence places a significant emphasis on staff consultation and staff input at all levels in the development and implementation of action programmes to progress reforms in the Civil Service.

The first finding of the disease  was confirmed on 12 October 2012 in County Leitrim.  My Department has been resolute in its efforts to stop the spread of this disease and to prevent further infection.  The consignment, made up of some 30,000 plants imported from continental Europe, was planted over 11 sites.  The ash trees at each of these 11 sites were cut and destroyed by burning without delay last month.  Symptoms were found initially on the site in Leitrim and then subsequently in a small number of trees in a site in Galway, two sites in Tipperary, a site in Meath and a site in Monaghan, all from this one infected batch.  This work was undertaken with the co-operation of forest owners and forestry contractors and supervised by Departmental Forestry Inspectors.  <\/p><p>  Voluntary measures agreed with forestry stakeholders, the nursery sector and hurley makers to prevent the importation of infected material from the continent has now been superseded by robust legislation.  This legislation, introduced simultaneously with Northern Ireland, makes it an offence to import plants from areas known to have <i>Chalara fraxinea. <\/i>  Furthermore, the movement of plants within the country are now also subject to plant passport requirements.  Legislation, was also signed into law, which control ash wood movement into Ireland, including firewood and hurley ash.  Under the legislation ash wood may enter the State if (1) it comes from an area free of the disease or (2) its free of outer round surface (including bark) or (3) its kiln dried below 20% moisture. <\/p><p>  In terms of future actions, site surveys of the ash estate are continuing this week.  These surveys on the health of our ash trees will focus on sites which are at most risk from infection.  These will include recently planted forests which used material imported ash plants from the continent.  Examinations of ash imported wood and planting material will also be increased to enforce recently enacted legislation.<\/p><p>  In relation to specific biosecurity measures to be observed where the disease is suspected or where ash surveys are being carried out the Department currently recommend the following hygiene measures.  In relation to footwear, it is recommended to wash off all soil and plant debris from boots.  Boots should then be sprayed with disinfectant and used water should be disposed of onto an area where the water will not run into a watercourse.  In relation to clothing, it is recommended to check all clothing and remove any plant material.

The Committee comprise representatives of industry and processors and is chaired by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&WFPO).  The Department is not represented on the Committee nor is any other State agency.  However, the Marine Institute advises the Committee from time to time on scientific issues relating to the stock and was very involved with the Committee in the preparation of a Rebuilding Plan for the Stock which was accepted by the Minister and submitted to the EU Commission.  <\/p><p>  As part of the recovery plan for Celtic Sea Herring stock the CSHMAC recommended the establishment in 2006 of a restricted fishery for vessels under 50ft in overall length in the Dunmore East spawning area to assist with the provision of scientific information on the stock.  From 2007 to 2011, 8% of the overall Celtic Sea Herring quota was allotted to the fishery.  In the years to 2007 to 2010 an average of 25 vessels booked into the fishery, a number of which subsequently chose not to participate.  In 2011 this increased to 40 vessels and in 2012 the number booking in increased to 72 vessels.  Most of these vessels had never participated in the Sentinel Fishery before.<\/p><p>  As part of the revised Ministerial policy on Celtic Sea Herring announced in June 2012, the proportion of Herring quota allocated to the Sentinel was increased to 11% of the national quota, which is the maximum amount that the fishery can sustain, as advised by the Marine Institute.  At the same time, a whitefish and shellfish preclusion was introduced for participants for the duration of the fishery.<\/p><p>  As the maximum quota to this fishery is restricted by the scientific advice available, the possible quota allocations are greatly impacted of the number of vessels booking in.  The CSHMAC, having regard to the number of vessels booking-in and the amount of quota available, recommended a set of management arrangements agreed by all industry representatives on the committee for 2012.  I accepted these recommendations.<\/p><p>  In view of the changes to herring fisheries in 2012, I provided vessels booked into the fishery with the opportunity to book out of the fishery, without penalty, by Friday 9 November as the individual allocations available were known at the time.  The arrangements in place including the size categories of vessels for allocations, were recommended by the CSHMAC.  The Department brought the matter to the attention of the CSHMAC, who has advised the that tier categories are set out on a pilot basis for 2012 and the committee intends to propose changes to area of categorisation for 2013, including the issue of imperial Vs decimal vessel sizing.  <\/p><p>  Until I have an opportunity to examine the proposals from the CSHMAC and decide on clarifications, if any, to the current situation, the imperial measurement system will continue to apply.

The Committee comprise representatives of industry and  processors and is chaired by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&WFPO). The Department is not represented on the Committee nor is any other State agency.  However, the Marine Institute advises the Committee from time to time on scientific issues relating to the stock and was very involved with the Committee in the  preparation of a Rebuilding Plan for the Stock which was accepted by the Minister and submitted to the EU Commission.  <\/p><p>As part of the recovery plan for Celtic Sea Herring stock the CSHMAC recommended the establishment in 2006 of a restricted fishery for vessels under 50ft in overall length in the Dunmore East spawning area to assist with the provision of scientific information on the stock. From 2007 to 2011, 8% of the overall Celtic Sea Herring quota was allotted to the fishery. In the years to 2007 to 2010 an average of 25 vessels booked into the fishery, a number of which subsequently chose not to participate. In 2011 this increased to 40 vessels and in  2012 the number booking in increased to 72 vessels  , most of these vessels, including the one referred to by the Deputy had never participated in the Sentinel Fishery before.<\/p><p>  As part of the revised Ministerial policy on Celtic Sea Herring announced in June 2012, the proportion of Herring quota allocated to the Sentinel was increased to 11% of the national quota, which is the maximum amount that the fishery can sustain as advised by the Marine Institute. At the same time a whitefish and shellfish preclusion was introduced for participants for the duration of the fishery.<\/p><p>  As the maximum quota to this fishery is restricted by the scientific advice available, the possible quota allocations are greatly impacted of the number of vessels booking in.<\/p><p>  The CSHMAC having regard to the number of vessels booking-in and the amount of quota available recommended a set of management arrangements agreed by all the industry representatives on the committee for 2012. I accepted these recommendations.<\/p><p>  In view of the changes to herring fisheries in 2012, I provided vessels booked into the fishery with the opportunity to book out of the fishery, without penalty by Friday 9 November as the quota available was known at the time. The vessel referred to by the Deputy did not exercise this option.<\/p><p>  The vessel in question measures less than 30ft in length overall, therefore under the current agreed management arrangements the vessel falls into the &lt;30 ft category for quota allocation.  These arrangements in place were recommended by the CSHMAC.   <\/p><p>  The Department brought the matter to the attention of the CSHMAC who have advised the size categories are set out are on a pilot basis for 2012 and the committee proposes to propose changes to  area of categorisation for 2013 including the issue of imperial Vs decimal vessel sizing.  <\/p><p>  Until I have an opportunity to examine the proposals from the CSHMAC and decide on clarifications if any to the current situation, the imperial measurement system will continue to apply.   It is important to point out that any changes introduced will be based on a full evaluation taking account of the situation of all vessels and the proper and rational management of this fishery.  Accordingly, the possible impact of any changes on individual  vessels  can not be anticipated.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Appeals","counter":1191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1192,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[49685\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a decision will be made on an appeal of a decision to refuse disadvantaged area scheme in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1193,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number, their derogation applications having been unsuccessful, who have now appealed my Department&rsquo;s decision to the recently constituted, independently chaired, DAS Appeals Committee.

The hotline shall be available on the number 116 000.\"  The same Directive also requires Member States to \"ensure that citizens are adequately informed of the existence and use of services provided under the 116 numbering range, in particular through initiatives specifically targeting persons travelling between Member States.\"  The hotline service will operate on two levels: the reporting of a missing child to the relevant authorities - in this case, the Garda - and the provision of emotional support to parents of missing children.  Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline.  My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to advance this matter.  Following cross-departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project Team, ComReg, which has responsibility for the allocation of this number in Ireland, has now allocated the number to the ISPCC.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999\/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.  In the interim the ISPCC has developed, with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an interim response that is currently heard if one rings the 116000 number.  The number advises callers to report a missing child to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and if a child is calling for assistance, to contact the ISPCC.  It is essential that the hotline service is operated in accordance with all best practice standards.  In order to fulfil this, the ISPCC have advised that a phased implementation will be necessary.  They envisage that the number will become operational in December 2012 from 22:00-16:00, 7 days a week, and will be operating on a 24-hour basis by February 2013.  This will be considered a 'pilot' phase.  This will give the ISPCC the time to complete the necessary training, develop and implement formal relationships with statutory authorities, overcome technical troubleshooting and prepare a 116 000 service launch and awareness campaign.  It is intended that an official launch will take place on 25 May 2013, which is International Missing Children Day.  The service launch bears particular importance as it is crucial that the public understand this is a support service rather than an emergency service.  The service launch will comprise of a media and event launch, face to face outreaches by ISPCC service staff and promotional materials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRZ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1291,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[49647\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the amount currently being spent on, or budgeted for by State agencies under her remit for spending, on the areas of communication, public relations, consultancy, advertising and human resources; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1292,"content":"<p>Four agencies are funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote: the Adoption Authority of Ireland; the Family Support Agency; the National Educational Welfare Board; and the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office.

Some 600 organisations are funded each year.  These services aim to support people to deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships, to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation and to support families who have experienced the death of a family member.  Over 17,000 individual counselling sessions were delivered within Family Resource Centres in 2011.  Of these individual counselling sessions, over 4,000 concerned bereavement.  In 2011, the Family Support Agency provided funding of &euro;8,800 to the organisation in question under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations for the provision of counselling services.  In addition, the Family Support Agency last year provided &euro;10,000 to the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network to fund a scoping study on the feasibility and necessity of a bereavement network.  I subsequently launched such a Network in July 2012.  The Network is a hub for those working with bereaved children, young people and their families and aims to improve access to bereavement information, allow for the sharing of expertise, knowledge and experience and improve the range and quality of bereavement support available to children, young people and, crucially, those caring for them.  In this respect it is very welcome.  The Network is being hosted for an initial period by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  It will be the subject of an interim review after two years and an evaluation after five years.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy was part of the Steering Committee which oversaw the development and completion of the scoping study on the establishment of the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network.  The Network is in the early stages of development and is currently inviting members, with a target of 70 members set for the first year.  I am advised by the Family Support Agency that it provides funding to many of the members of the Network and that any collaboration which improves efficiencies is to be welcomed.  Finally, the Deputy will wish to note that the Government has previously announced that the functions of the Family Support Agency will transfer to the new Child and Family Support Agency upon its establishment in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform","counter":1310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRZ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1311,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[50638\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRZ02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline the opportunities that persons in lower grades of the Public Service have been afforded ion contributing to the reforms of the public service as sought in the Public Service Agreement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1312,"content":"<p>The objective of the Public Service Agreement is to ensure that the Public Service continues its contribution to the return of economic growth and economic prosperity while delivering excellence in service to the Irish public.

for as long as possible. This objective is realised through a range of Home Care supports, or other measures such as Day or Respite Care facilities. These services are core to not only supporting the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people , but also can alleviate pressures elsewhere in the wider care system.  In addition, we also support access, as appropriate, to Long or Short-Term Residential Care. <\/p><p>  The demand for these services, which are often delivered in partnership with non-statutory agencies, will continue as the demographics, and the complex needs, of older people change. For example, at present, there are approximately 535,000  people over age 65 (11% of total population).  This is projected to rise to about 775,000 by 2021, 910,000 by 2026, and to around 1.4 million by 2041 (22% of the total population).  The number over age 85 is expected to quadruple from approximately 110,000 in 2006 to 444,000 by 2041.  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of services for vulnerable older people is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times. In this regard, 2012 has been a very challenging year for the health services generally, and the reality is that this will continue to be the position for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>  It remains the case, however, that investment in this area is significant by any standard, as the HSE Service Plan 2012 provided in the region of &euro;1.4 billion overall for Services for Older People. This includes Long Term Residential Care, Home Care Supports and Day or Respite Care.  All measures are being taken by the HSE to ensure that as many people as possible continue to receive appropriate services, in line with assessed individual needs.  The position in relation to 2013, or beyond, is obviously subject to the annual Estimates process, in the light of evolving resources and services priorities for the health sector overall.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the difficult economic situation to be overcome, we intend to carry through insofar as possible the commitments relating to older people contained in the agreed Programme for Government.  These include a review of Fair Deal to consider, amongst other things, an extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), together with its overall sustainability.  The review will be completed in 2013.  We will also complete the National Positive Ageing Strategy, so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives. This measure will set the strategic tone for future years, across a number of Government Departments and agencies.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health reviews on a regular basis the projected future requirements for the health service, including policies and services relating to older people.

The role of the National Office is to oversee the implementation of <i>Reach Out<\/i> and to coordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.

The remaining &#8364;5 million is available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.<\/p><p>  To assist my Department in advising the Government on the formation of hospital groups, in June this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups.  The Strategic Board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.<\/p><p>  A Project Team was established to make recommendations on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions for the consideration of the Strategic Board.  The consultation process to inform the project team has been rigorous and comprehensive.  It has included meetings with every acute hospital, including consultations on two separate occasions with each hospital in the South East region; it has involved the receipt of a significant volume of formal submissions from hospitals, clinicians, regulatory bodies and citizens, all of which have been considered.<\/p><p>  The organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the on-going development of the HSE Clinical Programmes and by the Smaller Hospitals Framework, which defines the role of the smaller hospitals and  is intrinsically linked to the on-going work regarding the development of hospital groups.<\/p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals.  It is about bringing together groups of hospitals into single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery; it is about ensuring that hospital groups are broadly comparable in size and scope so that they can attract high-quality staff and trainees across all health care specialities and professions; it is about creating efficiencies by using common business processes and economies of scale and avoiding unnecessary duplication; most importantly of all, it is about maximising the range of services available to deliver internationally comparable quality care for patients, regardless of where they live.<\/p><p>  I am hopeful that I will receive the report of the Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups later this month and that I will be able to bring this matter to my cabinet colleagues for decision shortly thereafter.  Finally, it should be remembered that the hospital groups are an interim, collaborative measure pending the legislation required to establish hospital trusts: before those trusts are established, the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRBB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Acquired Infections","counter":1413,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRBB03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1414,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[49698\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRBB03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the hospitals and or healthcare centres in which Legionnaires disease occurred in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1415,"content":"<p>Since 2010 there have been three cases of patients having Legionella's Disease as a consequence of being a patient of a HSE healthcare facility.

It is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.  All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015.  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. <\/p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The e current fee structure is as follows: <\/p><p>A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;<\/p><p>An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax.<\/p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation. e greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. e twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the minimum required to enable the Council to operate.  The fee charged by the HSCPC, which  is mindful of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015, is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  It is calculated approximately on the basis of the overall projected costs of the agency when fully operational divided by the total number of registrants and then further reduced to &euro;295 to take account of the Council's phased establishment.  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.<\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:<\/p><p>Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting,  the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting is concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;<\/p><p>The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;<\/p><p>Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost-effective operating system is will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRDD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":1544,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRDD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1545,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[50132\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300067#WRDD03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the progress made on the implementation of the EU Directive 2010\/63\/EU on the use of animals for scientific and medical research purposes; and if he will confirm if the existing primary legislation here, which is in many aspects stronger than the provisions of the EU Directive, will be retained in the process of incorporating the Directive.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1546,"content":"<p>I do not accept that existing measures relating to the protection of animals used for scientific purposes set out in the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act as amended provide a higher level of protection to those set out in Directive 2010\/63\/EU.

No. 418\/2011 - Finance (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2011, personal property and land vested in or held in trust by a body corporate immediately prior to its dissolution (other than personal property or land held by such body upon trust for another person) becomes property of the State in the person of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform until such time as the company is restored to the Register or the Minister waives (under Section 31 of the Act) the interest vested in him.  This mechanism acts as a fail-safe so that property is never ownerless.<\/p><p>  The interest acquired by the Minister is described as a defeasible interest as it may be defeated by restoration of the company.  Neither company nor property law require comprehensive and fully up-to-date asset records to be lodged with the Company Registration Office and the Property Registration Authority.  Consequently, the only persons with a complete view of the assets held by a company at the time of its dissolution are the directors and officers of the company.  As a result, the Minister only becomes aware that assets have vested in him by virtue of the State Property Act once he has been notified by an interested party.  Administration of matters relating to real estate is delegated to the Office of Public Works.<\/p><p>  The outcome of the situation described above is that the Minister\/OPW can only become aware of properties that vest in the Minister when applicants write seeking a waiver in relation to a particular property and provide evidence of the properties vesting in the Minister. Even in such situations, information may only be made available on a particular property which may have vested in the Minister and information on further properties may not be made available.  Furthermore, even though a company may be dissolved, the properties held by the company may not necessarily vest in the Minister, for example, they could be held on trust.  Where no applications for waivers are received in relation to particular companies dissolving, no information is available on properties which could vest in the Minister.<\/p><p>  Section 31 of the State Property Act, 1954 permits the Minister to divest himself of property which devolved to the State under Section 28(2).  Upon receipt of an application, the Minister may waive the right of the State to such property as he thinks proper having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  In general, the Minister will waive his interest in any such property where it is established that the applicant has a moral or quasi-moral right to the property in question.  Where common interests apply, for example in the case of roads in housing estates, the Minister generally waives in favour of the relevant local authority.  Notwithstanding the power to waive, it must be remembered that the primary mechanism available to the directors and beneficial owners of a company to regain control of their property is to restore the company to the register.  In support of the legal policy underpinning the Companies Acts, the policy in relation to waivers is that the Minister does not waive in favour of the former directors of the dissolved company.<\/p><p>  Bearing all these matters in mind, a list setting out details on the lines requested by the Deputy is currently in preparation and will be forwarded to him by the Office of Public Works as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300068#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1633,"content":"<p>Question No. 315 answered with Question No. 311.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1634,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300068#WRM01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1635,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[49403\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300068#WRM01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the cost of establishing the Ireland Stat website; the number of staff allocated to its running and their salaries; the annual cost of running this website; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":1636,"content":"<p><i>Ireland Stat<\/i> is a new initiative to provide simple and clear information about how Ireland is performing by reference to well-specified indicators across the broad range of governmental activity. It is part of the Government&#8217;s modernisation of presenting information on how public money is spent, allocated and accounted for and is a natural development of the Performance Budgeting initiative that was rolled out to almost all Departments at the start of this year and published in the Estimates document in February. These initiatives set expenditure in the context of Departments&#8217; strategic goals, as set out in their Statements of Strategy, and present performance information, both in terms of actions and impacts, alongside the financial and human resources information that was already included in the Estimates.  Both the Performance Budgeting initiative and <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> meet the Programme for Government commitment for greater accountability and transparency and build performance information into the heart of the budgetary process.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, these initiatives represent a considerable streamlining of information and reporting of what Government Departments and Agencies are doing and achieving with public money. In particular, Performance Budgeting replaces the requirement to produce Annual Output Statements, a process that involved a degree of administrative burden on Departments and Offices as they had to reshape how information was presented in the Estimates to match the structure of their Statements of Strategy. There is now a single, coherent way of presenting the complex array of information that relates to each specific policy programme.<\/p><p>  As I have already noted, the development of <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> is very much part of my Department&#8217;s ongoing work on the Performance Budgeting initiative and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> initiative was in the main developed using the skills and knowledge of the officials in my Department. The technical aspects of the <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> development were managed in-house using internal Systems Development expertise. There are no staff allocated whole-time to running <i>Ireland Stat<\/i>: a small team from the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit, part of the newly established Irish Government Economic &amp; Evaluation Service, were involved in the selection of the indicators and the overall website structure, as one element of their broader work programme, in close liaison with colleagues working on the overall programme of public sector reform. Their work has been informed by international best practice in this area. External consultancy services were retained for the specialist website design and the supporting graphics, for a total cost of just under &#8364;5,100.<\/p><p>  As <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> is at a pilot phase there is a public consultation under way and details regarding this consultation are available from the <i>Ireland Stat<\/i> website.

This spending pattern is in line with trends from previous years which show that the bulk of capital expenditure takes place in the last quarter of the year.<\/p><p>  The potential for end year savings is dependent also on the decisions which will be taken shortly in relation to capital carryover. The capital carryover facility is an arrangement under which Departments are permitted to carryover unspent capital (up to 10% of their allocation) into the following year. This facility is an integral part of the rolling multi-annual capital system. The carryover facility means that moneys which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital can now be made available for spending on programme priorities in the following year.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the profiling of capital expenditure is carried out by individual Departments on the basis of the likely timing of payments related to capital projects and programmes which they deliver. Job creation is not a factor of the profiling exercise. However, job creation and labour intensity of individual projects are factors that are taken into account when deciding on the allocation of capital to Departments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300068#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":1642,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300068#WRM02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1643,"qnumday":320,"qnumall":"[49587\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300068#WRM02300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"how well funded all semi-State company pension schemes are; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":1644,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question each Department is responsible for providing pension fund details in relation to commercial semi State companies for which they hold responsibility.<\/p><p>  In relation to An Post National Lottery Company which comes under the aegis of my Department I wish to inform the Deputy that pay and pensions issues are a matter for An Post.

Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills and labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as health care, information technology and financial services.<\/p><p>  Ireland has to compete with other countries for migrant labour, particularly in respect of high-level skills. Skills required in the high-tech sectors are in demand and in short supply globally. While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is the most sustainable way forward in the long term, in the short term, there continues to be a need to supplement Ireland&rsquo;s skills stock through employment permits and to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s employment permits system is geared towards attracting such skills.<\/p><p>  The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the implementation of policy in relation to the admission of non-EEA nationals to the State and their residence in the State.  However, the employment permit regime provides for control of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market as well as powers for enforcement of employment rights. Deputies will be only too aware that economic migrants are a vulnerable class of people. Therefore, any actions affecting inward economic migration should be cognisant of the need to ensure that such migrants are protected and made aware of their employment rights.<\/p><p>  The Employment Permits regime is supporting the enterprise sector and significant levels of applications are successful particularly those based on high skills levels. Figures indicate: a reduction in total applications in line with economic circumstances, but an increase in Green Card applications, in line with a greater emphasis on high value skills; and an increase in the proportion of applications in respect of ICT job roles with applications in respect of ICT job roles being more successful than the norm. Over 90% of ICT related applications are successful and over 1,000 ICT related applications have been approved so far this year.  My Department has reviewed its processes with a view to attracting more ICT related applications and is confident that significant improvements can be made shortly which will greatly enhance the employment permits regime, for example, in conjunction with Forf&aacute;s, a review is underway of the Green Card Employment Permit Scheme which is used by Ireland to meet labour market requirements where skills shortages have been identified by reference to analyses undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. An interim review of the four core employment permit types - Green Cards, Intra-Company Transfers, Work Permits and Spousal\/Dependents - is being conducted with a view to improving the throughput and quality of employment permit applications. Such an initiative would favour the ICT sector in particular as it would include a streamlining of the documentary process, a reduction in the time it takes for applicants to prepare a successful application, and a significant reduction in processing times.  Closer interactions are being cultivated with the Department of Justice and Equality with a view to providing a more coherent service across the employment permit regime and visa regime including policy convergence, greater information sharing and unified communications from both Departments in respect of labour market access.  I intend to announce a range of improvements in this regard shortly.<\/p><p>  It is also the Government&rsquo;s ambition that Ireland should take advantage of the opportunities for employment in the ICT sector and that every opportunity is afforded to our graduates and unemployed to prepare them with the skills required to work in that sector. Employment Permits are but one way of increasing the level of ICT skills available in the labour market. Building Ireland&rsquo;s ICT skills capability will require improving the domestic output of skilled ICT graduates and my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills has already put in place plans to establish an overarching target of doubling the annual output from honours degree ICT undergraduate programmes to 2,000 graduates by 2018.  These plans involve actions to: increase the domestic supply of honours degree graduates in the short term through expansion of conversion; and boost the longer term supply and quality of graduates from the higher education system.<\/p><p>  Finally, work is also proceeding with regard to the preparation of new employment permits legislation which will provide for more flexibility and targeted instruments in support of the economy&rsquo;s evolving skills needs. Heads of Bill were approved by Government last April and since then, my Department has been engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) in order to progress the drafting of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300068#WRM04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies","counter":1669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300068#WRM04050"},{"type":"question","counter":1670,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[49655\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300068#WRM04100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the amount currently being spent on, or budgeted for by State agencies under his remit for spending, on the areas of communication, public relations, consultancy, advertising and human resources; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":1671,"content":"<p>With regard to the expenditure by Agencies, this is a day-to-day matter for the individual Agencies concerned for which I have no responsibility.

The EU Framework Programmes have been an important element in the internationalisation of Irish research, offering Ireland's SMEs, multinationals, and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts.  FP7 is built largely around collaborative research (Cooperation) and mobility of researchers (People).  However, it also contains a number of innovative elements, the most important of which is &ldquo;Ideas&rdquo; which provides the funding for the European Research Council. <\/p><p>  In order for Ireland to extract the maximum benefit from the opportunities available within FP7, a National Support Network has been put in place, headed by a National Director for FP7 based in Enterprise Ireland who leads a team of national contact points for various elements of the Programme.  This support structure ensures that a coordinated and coherent approach is adopted towards FP7 across all of the Government Departments, agencies and other organisations involved.  Through this support structure, a mix of guidance, advice and financial assistance is available to encourage researchers and companies, large and small, to avail of the opportunities within the Programme. <\/p><p>  In the period from the beginning of 2007 when the Seventh Framework Programme began to June this year, the latest period for which data is available, almost 6,000 applicants from Irish based organisations took part in FP7 proposals requesting European funding.  Of these, almost 1400 applicants have been successful, giving an overall Irish success rate of over 23%.  Funding awards to Irish participants to date is &euro;438 million, covering a period of five and a half years.  <\/p><p>  Five areas account for 65% of the funding: Information &amp; Communication Technologies (&euro;89.5 million); Health (&euro;64 million); Marie Curie (Mobility Programme) (&euro;62 million); Nanoscience, Nanotechnology, Materials &amp; Production Processes (&euro;38 million); and European Research Council (&euro;34 million).<\/p><p>  Agrifood (&euro;28m), Research for the Benefit of SMEs (&euro;26m), Security (&euro;18m), Transport (&euro;17m), Energy (&euro;16.5m), Research Infrastructures (&euro;16.5m), Environment (&euro;14m), Science in Society (&euro;7.5m), Space (&euro;2.7m) and Socio-Economic Sciences &amp; Humanities (&euro;2.4m) follow, while other areas have resulted in funding of less than &euro;1 million per area to date. <\/p><p>  Based on recent national investment in research, Ireland is participating in the Framework Programme from a far stronger position than ever before.  A critical mass of research activity has developed in both the public and private sectors, and the design of FP7 suits the needs of Irish researchers in many ways.  It has been adapted to encourage industry participation, the application process has been simplified, industry-specific targets have been set and higher funding rates have been agreed.  The high level of activity of Irish researchers (academic and industry) and the Irish success rate ahead of the overall EU average are very positive indications of our strong participation in FP7.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300069#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":1679,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300069#WRN00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1680,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[49863\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300069#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps he is taking to support small rural shops and businesses in County Meath; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":1681,"content":"<p>Ensuring that more micro and small businesses can start up, expand and export is a key pillar of the Government&#8217;s plans for jobs and growth.

This is the forum in which overarching industrial relations matters are discussed in the Department.  It is composed of representatives of management and staff in the Department.  The Staff Side includes local representatives and trade union officials for all recognised staff representative bodies in the Department.  The Departmental Council is the internal monitoring body for the implementation of this Department&#8217;s commitments under the Public Service Agreement.<\/p><p>  In addition, updates on progress under the Public Service Agreement are periodically provided to the Department&#8217;s Partnership Committee.  The Partnership Committee is composed of management, trade union and staff representatives.<\/p><p>  Staff and union representatives can also put forward proposals for reform within the Departmental Council and the Partnership Committee. <\/p><p>  In addition the reform of the State&#8217;s Workplace Relations structures, announced by me in July 2011, provides significant opportunities for consultation, dialogue and input from staff.  The Reform Programme will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), the Labour Relations Commission (LRC), the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. <\/p><p>  The Workplace Relations Reform Programme Office was established in September 2011 in order to progress the Reform Programme and to date substantial progress has already been made with a number of important priority actions that were identified by the Minister having been successfully delivered within the target timescale. <\/p><p>  The Programme Office is conscious of the importance of effective communications with staff under what is a major change management initiative.  In this regard, the Programme Office has engaged extensively with all staff that has been affected by the Reform Programme including staff members that are serving in the lower grades of the public service.  A number of specific measures have been introduced in this regard, including: <\/p><p>Project Teams, comprising representation from all Workplace Relations Bodies, have been employed to progress all reform initiatives (Single Contact Portal, Website, Complaint Form and ERS).  Membership of these Teams is open to all grades. EAT, LRC, NERA, Labour Court and Equality Tribunal representatives on Project Teams are required to keep their respective staff (at all levels) apprised of developments under the Reform Programme.  <\/p><p>The Director of the Workplace Relations Reform and Liaison has held a number of briefing sessions directly with staff of the Bodies.  He also gave briefings to the Departmental Council and Partnership Committees of DJEI and the Partnership Committee of the Equality Tribunal.<\/p><p>The Programme Office is working directly with the relevant staff of the Workplace Relations Bodies as part of a major review of business processes.  Workshops have been held with staff to map existing processes and design future business processes.<\/p><p>Progress under the Reform Programme is posted to a dedicated content area on the DJEI Intranet and on NERAnet.<\/p><p>Public Consultation documents have been made available to staff in advance of publication.<\/p><p>Internal communication and collaboration tools and technology is employed to support the establishment of the new structures, keep staff of the Bodies up to date on progress under the Project and encourage and facilitate discussion on the reforms.<\/p><p>A Newsletter charting progress and developments generally is published by the Programme Office on <\/p><p>Staffing Requirements for the new WRC and Labour Court: It is important to put in place the right staffing levels and skills to support the operations and activities of the WRC and the Labour Court.  It will be 2014 before the reform is fully complete and the long-term staffing requirements of the WRC and the Labour Court are in place.<\/p><p>  The Department has recognised that it is very important to consult and work with staff and their representatives to provide as smooth a transition as possible through the process.  In this regard, a Consultation Paper entitled the Proposed Staffing of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court was circulated to all staff in August, 2012.  Feedback on this document was facilitated by, among other means, a series of meetings during September and October with all the staff of the Workplace Relations Bodies.  The Consultation Paper was also circulated to the unions representing staff.  Taking into account any feedback received it is intended to produce a Structures and Staffing Plan for the new WRC and Labour Court in November, 2012.  The plan will be made available to the Workplace Relations Implementation Group and various stakeholders when finalised.<\/p><p>  As can be seen from the foregoing there has been extensive consultation with staff within the existing Workplace Relations Bodies in relation to the all aspects of the Reform programme.  The objective is to ensure maximum engagement with all staff as the reforms progress and to ensure that all staff, including those serving in the lower grades, have had the opportunity to make a meaningful and valuable input into the Reform Project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300069#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Social Protection","counter":1689,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300069#WRN01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance Fund","counter":1688,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300069#WRN01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1689,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[50032\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300069#WRN01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will consider introducing a third higher band of employer PRSI contributions on salaries of &euro;100,000 or more; if she will outline the net effect that she believes such a policy would have on both revenue generated and employment; her views on the unusually small contribution which social security taxes make to Irish Government revenues when compared to other European countries; her views on whether there is scope to increase rates on higher incomes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1690,"content":"<p>I am most concerned about the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and one of my key goals is to reform the system of social protection and to put it on a sounder financial footing for the future.

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 89,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;436 million in 2012.<\/p><p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p><p>  However, rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected.  For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 89,000 additional clients, the landlords.  This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.  It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short term need.<\/p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent.

In the first case, where a social welfare claimant is in receipt of maintenance payments from a spouse\/partner, housing costs incurred by the social welfare claimant (e.g. rent or mortgage payments and\/or home improvement loan) up to a maximum of &euro;95.23 per week may be offset against the maintenance payment, with half the balance of the maintenance being assessed as means. These arrangements ensure that there is always an incentive to receive a maintenance payment.<\/p><p>  In the second case, where a social welfare claimant is paying maintenance to another person, whether on a voluntary basis or on foot of a Court order, their means for social welfare purposes are their means before they meet any obligations they may have to pay maintenance i.e. no account is taken of such payments in assessing the means of the maintenance payer. Thus, for example, in the event of the payer having income from employment or self-employment, the income from these sources is assessed without regard to any maintenance paid to another person. If maintenance payments were taken into account, any reduction in these means as a consequence of maintenance payments to another person would, in effect, result in the welfare system subsidizing or possibly fully meeting these payments. <\/p><p>  Where a person has maintenance obligations on foot of a Court order and they find that they can no longer afford to meet those obligations, for example because their circumstances have changed, it is open to that person to seek to have the Court review the order in light of their changed income position. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300071#WRP04900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1835,"content":"<p>Question No. 392 answered with Question No. 375.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":1836,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300071#WRP05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1837,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[50004\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300071#WRP05200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an application for carer's allowance was received in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; when a decision may be expected; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1838,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 22\/12\/11.

The meetings covered a number of issues including the prospect for renewable electricity trading between the jurisdictions in the context of the framework provided by the Renewable Energy Directive.<\/p><p>  Exploring renewable trade was already agreed at a high level at the 2011 June British Irish Council summit and had been progressed in the interim at the British Irish Council working group level.<\/p><p>  In June this year at a meeting in London with Minister Hendry, both sides agreed to work towards concluding a Memorandum of Understanding around the end of the year which will be an important step in relation to the proposition of cross border renewable trade between the two jurisdictions.  This was further progressed at my most recent meeting with Secretary of State Ed Davey on 20 September following the official launch of the East West Interconnector.<\/p><p>  Increased interconnection between the two islands offers Irish developers the prospect of being able to access a much larger electricity market.  The electricity market in GB is around ten times the scale of the electricity market in Ireland.  In the short term there are opportunities for on and offshore wind and biomass projects, but in the medium to longer term as technologies mature and become commercially deployable, there will also be opportunities for wave and tidal developers.<\/p><p>  There are currently a number of potential project developers that have expressed interest in renewable export.  Several of these developers have met with me to indicate their interest in developing the business of renewable electricity exporters.  These developers have also underlined to me the need to progress the bilateral discussions with the UK.<\/p><p>  In developing the Memorandum of Understanding, officials from both sides are examining a range of issues around the electricity market, regulatory and technical grid areas to underpin the creation of cross jurisdictional renewable electricity trade.

Liability for the Charge is not contingent on receipt of any form of invoice detailing the services provided to, or received by, a liable person.<\/p><p>  The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service\/agency basis for all county and city councils. There was no existing comprehensive database of residential properties and their owners within the State prior to the Household Charge being introduced. The collection of the Household Charge via self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property and will be an essential component for implementing a full local property tax. Local authorities are continuing to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions, and significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other datasets and in refining the resulting data.<\/p><p>  The Agency and local authorities will continue their work in maximising compliance with a charge which funds essential local services for communities. Non-compliance by liable owners means reduced resources for local authorities to use to support communities and places a greater burden on those owners who do pay the Charge.<\/p><p>  It is an offence to fail to declare a liability and also to fail to pay the Charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS02400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Members' Remuneration","counter":1974,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1975,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[49549\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS02500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the annual representational payment under the 2001 Local Government Act paid to town councillors in 2011 broken down by town council.","asker":"1101","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":1976,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[49550\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS02600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the total expenses paid out to town councillors in 2011 broken down by town council.","asker":"1101","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1977,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 440 and 441 together.<\/p><p>  It is a matter for each local authority to pay the annual representational payment s and my Department does not have details of payments by town councils on the basis of rates of payments approved by me.<\/p><p>  The rates of representational payments for town councillors are as follows: &#8364;8,362 for borough councils, and the town councils of Athlone, Bray, Dundalk, Ennis and Tralee; &#8364;4,181 for other rating town councils together with the non-rating town councils of Balbriggan, Droichead Nua, Greystones, Leixlip, Mullingar, Portlaoise and Shannon; and &#8364;2,282 for all other non-rating town councils.<\/p><p>  An Annual Expenses Allowance designed to defray, in a structured way, reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings associated with council business is also payable at the following rates: &#8364;3,054 for borough councils, and the town councils of Athlone, Bray, Dundalk, Ennis and Tralee; &#8364;2,036 for other rating town councils together with the non-rating town councils of Balbriggan, Droichead Nua, Greystones, Leixlip, Mullingar, Portlaoise and Shannon; and &#8364;1,018 for all other non-rating town councils.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to consult the public registers, provided for in section 142(4)(g) of the Local Government Act 2001, maintained by the relevant local authorities by virtue of article 8 of the Local Government (Representational Payment for Members) Regulations 2001 in order to determine the amounts paid by individual town councils.<\/p><p>  The Action Programme for Effective Local Government &#8211; <i>Putting People First<\/i>, provides for a review of the structures for and levels of all payments to councillors, to reduce overall costs and levels of payments to individuals, while having regard to the reformed sub-county structure and regional governance, and the need to ensure sufficient incentive for high-quality representation of the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS02700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing","counter":1978,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1979,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[49571\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS02800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the estimated number of local authority houses currently rented; his plans to exempt this category from the proposed property tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1980,"content":"<p>The number of local authority houses let as of 31 December 2011 was 125,958, which is the most recent data available.

The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the Household Charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund. The proceeds from the Household Charge are being re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants.<\/p><p>  General Purpose Grants contribute towards meeting the reasonable cost to local authorities of providing services to their customers. Some &euro;651m in General Purpose Grants had been allocated to local authorities for 2012. It has been necessary for me to reduce General Purpose Grant funding to local authorities in the third quarter of this year in light of the level of compliance with the household charge.<\/p><p>  It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable for the Household Charge. As such, if collected in full, the Household Charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually. As of 9 November 2012 some &euro;109m had been collected nationally. A total of &euro;15,695,292 was withheld from the Quarter 3 General Purpose Grant payment. For county and city councils, this represented a reduction of between 1% and 3% of the total General Purpose Grant allocation for 2012. <\/p><p>  I am keeping the income generated from the Household Charge under constant review and those local authorities that achieve a collection rate of 65% or above will suffer no further reduction in their General Purpose Grant allocation for 2012. However, it is up to individual local authorities to address any potential funding shortfalls arising from non-compliance with the legislation and to pursue those who may have a liability and initiate court proceedings, where it is considered appropriate. Non-compliance by liable owners does, however, result in reduced resources for local authorities to support communities and this places a greater burden on those owners who do pay the Charge.<\/p><p>  I am confident that the level of General Purpose Grants, together with other Government grants and subsidies and income raised from local sources, is appropriate to meet the costs of providing a reasonable level of local authority services to communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS03300","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Charge","counter":1987,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1988,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[49617\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300074#WRS03400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the position regarding the properties registered for the household charge to date; the number that have been registered by persons who registered two or more properties and the number of persons that have registered two or more properties for the household charge.","asker":"954","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1989,"content":"<p>The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service\/agency basis for all county and city councils.

The Household Charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge. Having done so, I consider that a liable owner has discharged his or her primary responsibilities under the Act.   <\/p><p>There was no existing comprehensive database of residential properties and their owners within the State prior to the Household Charge being introduced. The collection of the Household Charge via self-assessment declaration provides for the collation of such information in relation to residential property and will be an essential component for implementing the   Local Property Tax. Local authorities are continuing to identify undeclared properties through appropriate data sharing provisions, and significant efforts have been expended in matching self-declared information with other datasets and in refining the resulting data.   <\/p><p>I understand that the addresses and names used in the recent batch of letters which have been   issued by Local Authorities reminding people to pay the Household Charge have been based on a data matching exercise with the Property Registration Authority. <\/p><p>I also understand that every effort has been made to try and ensure letters are sent to current property owners. However there are some instances where letters are being sent to previous owners of properties, due to the fact that the more recent property owners may not have registered their property with the Authority or the transfer of the property has not been completed. Thus in some cases the information contained within these datasets may not reflect the most recent and relevant details. As a consequence, the data matching exercise can give rise to situations in which people may receive a letter where they have already paid the Charge. Due to differences in the formats of addresses between datasets, it has also been the case that some owners who have paid the Charge are receiving reminder letters.   <\/p><p>In other instances, letters have unfortunately been sent to deceased persons. I appreciate that receipt of such a letter may cause upset to relatives of a deceased person. However, in the absence of a comprehensive database, such instances, while regrettable, are also unavoidable if the Agency and local authorities are to continue their work in maximising compliance with a charge which funds essential local services for communities. <\/p><p>I understand that the letters which issued in recent weeks invite recipients who are not liable, or who have previously paid the household charge, or in the event of inaccuracy or error, to contact the Household Charge Bureau to allow the Agency to update their records accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300075#WRT01200","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff","counter":2021,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300075#WRT01250"},{"type":"question","counter":2022,"qnumday":455,"qnumall":"[49810\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300075#WRT01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide in a tabular form, a breakdown of the the total remuneration packages including pay, allowances such as travel and expenses, and contractual pension arrangements for each of the four Dublin local authorities city and county managers; and if he will provide the same remuneration details for all heads of Departments\/senior managers of each of the local authorities.","asker":"1008","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2023,"content":"<p>The salaries of the managers in Dublin local authorities are set in the context of manager salaries more broadly.

It is anticipated that such a visa will prove an attractive option for tourists and business visitors, particularly in the context of the island of Ireland by facilitating visitors to travel freely between Northern Ireland and Ireland without the need for a separate Irish or UK visa.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizenship Applications","counter":2073,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRU00550"},{"type":"question","counter":2074,"qnumday":475,"qnumall":"[49464\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding an application for Irish citizenship in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2075,"content":"<p>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in May, 2011.

The word \"hatred\" is defined as \"hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation\". The State's prosecutorial authorities have not brought to my notice any difficulties in bringing prosecutions under the 1989 Act.<\/p><p>  In addition to the foregoing legislation, where criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage, or public order offences are committed with a racist motive, they are prosecuted as generic offences though the wider criminal law. The trial judge can take aggravating factors, including racial motivation, into account at sentencing.<\/p><p>  A review of the 1989 Act was concluded in December, 2008 with the publication of research entitled &quot;Combating Racism and Xenophobia through the Criminal Law&quot; by the Centre for Criminal Justice, University of Limerick.  The research was commissioned by the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism and the National Action Plan Against Racism steering group.<\/p><p>  The report made only one recommendation regarding the criminal law - the introduction of racially aggravated sentencing. It stated that changes in the criminal law would be insufficient by themselves to address racism. The authors commented that it was clearly established, at both the national and international level, that greater dividends would ensue from more substantial investment in social and education measures.<\/p><p>  The introduction of racially aggravated sentencing would involve a restructuring of penalties for basic criminal offences (assault or criminal damage, for example) to increase sentences, and have wider implications for the criminal law. There are numerous other factors which can be considered aggravating.<\/p><p>  In this jurisdiction, the legislature enacts criminal laws which usually provide for maximum penalties in the form of a fine or imprisonment, or both. In general, there are no statutory sentencing guidelines.  Within our legislative framework, the determination of penalty in any individual case is largely a matter for the trial judge, taking case law, including appealed cases, into account.  This allows the courts to take all the circumstances of the offence and all the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors into account.  The gravity of the offence, the facts surrounding the commission of the offence, the criminal record of the accused and the impact on the victim are among the critical factors taken into account before a sentence is imposed.  The judge must take into account the circumstances of the offence and the offender. Moreover, the Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal against the sentence imposed if she believes it to be unduly lenient.<\/p><p>  In all the circumstances, I have no plans, at present, for legislative initiatives in relation to hate crime.

When complete, this assessment will be submitted to the Attorney General for her consideration. I am informed that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will not be in a position to outline his intentions as regards ratification of the Convention until this process is complete. <\/p><p>  My Department is working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others such as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a view to implementing additional procedures for the employment of private domestic workers in diplomatic households. The purpose of the additional procedures are, taking account of international best practice, to provide for  employment terms and conditions for domestic workers in diplomatic households that demonstrate respect for Irish laws and good employment practice.<\/p><p>  With regard to the issue of forced labour, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 which came into effect on 7 June 2008 criminalises the trafficking of persons for the purposes of labour exploitation. Section 1 of the 2008 Act defines labour exploitation in relation to a person (including a child) as follows: (a) subjecting the person to forced labour; (b) forcing him or her to render services to another, or (c) enslavement of the person or subjecting him or her to servitude or a similar condition or state.<\/p><p>  For the purposes of the Act, the term &quot;trafficks&quot; is broadly defined; for example, the commission of an offence does not require cross border movement or illegal entry into the State. It includes recruitment; taking a person into one's custody, care or charge; and providing the person with accommodation or employment. Officials in my Department will shortly be submitting to me a report providing an analysis of whether the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 is sufficient to cover all circumstances in which forced labour could occur and I will be considering this Report in the near future.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that, normally, an <i>au pair<\/i> arrangement is a private, voluntary arrangement between the parties concerned - a private household or sponsor family and a private individual &#8211; on the basis of a shared understanding.  Although circumstances can differ from case to case, an <i>&#8220;au pair&#8221;<\/i> is assumed not to be an employee because there is no contract of employment between the householder and the person in question.  If a contract of employment does exist then this places the arrangement on a different footing.  In general, where people have concerns that employees may be exploited or receiving less than their statutory entitlement the matter should be reported to the National Employment Rights Authority for investigation. A Code of Practice for Persons Employed in Other People&#8217;s Homes was developed by the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Act 1990 and promulgated in 2007.  The Code sets out certain employment rights and practices for persons employed in other people&#8217;s homes and encourages good practice and compliance with the law in such employment situations.  In any proceedings before a court, or a workplace relations dispute resolution body, a code of practice shall be admissible in evidence and any provision of the code which appears to the court, body or officer concerned to be relevant to any question arising in the proceedings shall be taken into account in determining that question. In addition to this code of practice which applies specifically to live-in employees, it is important to note that domestic workers are protected by virtue of the fact that the full suite of employment rights legislation, including that of redress for violations of their employment rights, apply to domestic workers in the same way as they apply to other categories of employees in Ireland.  In addition, the National Employment Rights Authority has carried out a programme of inspections involving domestic workers as well as continuing to respond to any complaints it receives from domestic workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRU02762","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Retirements","counter":2107,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRU02825"},{"type":"question","counter":2108,"qnumday":486,"qnumall":"[49736\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRU02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the supports in place for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who suffer from mental health issues such as anxiety and depression as a result of their work.","asker":"1066","askee":"1025"},{"type":"question","counter":2109,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[49737\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRU03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the proportion of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that retired following illness or injury on duty that were retired due to mental health issues such as anxiety or depression.","asker":"1066","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2110,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 and 487 together.<\/p><p>  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been granted ill health retirements from 1 January 2012 to 7 November 2012 was 1 Sergeant and 4 Garda&iacute;.

All options to avoid the need for personnel to relocate are being explored as part of this process.  Personnel are being offered the opportunity for reassignment within their current locations where this is feasible, together with opportunities for re-training and re-skilling.  In addition, a review system has been put in place whereby personnel who are unhappy with a proposed relocation can seek a review of a decision.  Inevitably, given the scale of the reorganisation, it will be necessary for some staff to move to new locations.  <\/p><p>  The creation of a new two Brigade structure for the Army under the reorganisation has resulted in Combat Support Units being reduced from nine units to six.  The Field Engineer companies based in McKee Barracks fall into this category, and the Headquarters element and Field Engineer Company are being relocated to Custume Barracks, Athlone.  Forty-five personnel from within the 2 Field Engineer Company will therefore have to move with their unit to Athlone, or be reassigned to alternative appointments available in other Units in the Dublin Area.  Pending the full rollout of the reorganisation plan it is not possible to say how many personnel can be facilitated though reassignment process.  However, there is no question of families being moved or being required to move arising from the reorganisation and this is a matter for each individual to decide.  The reality is that many Defence Forces personnel currently assigned to McKee barracks are not resident in Dublin and commute on a daily basis, which is a common feature across both the public and private sector of a modern, flexible and mobile working population in Ireland today.<\/p><p>  All members of the Defence Forces reassigned under the Defence Forces Reorganisation Plan 2012 are entitled to Change of Station Allowance in circumstances where they meet the qualifying criteria.  It is not possible at this point to estimate the total figure that will require to be paid in Change of Station allowance as this will be contingent on a number of factors including whether individuals will actually opt to physically relocate home or not. <\/p><p>  The Government is very much aware that the major re-organisation currently underway is a difficult process for many serving members of the Defence Forces and their families, who are being required to make decisions under the current reorganisation that they would not otherwise have to make, or in different times have had to consider.  Unfortunately, this is the consequence and reality of the reforms necessarily taking place across the public service today.  It must be reiterated that there is no painless way to fundamentally reorganise the Defence Forces whilst maintaining essential military capabilities and it has become necessary to mandatorily move some personnel whose units are being disestablished or relocated and who cannot be accommodated in their current location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRV03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Reform","counter":2187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2188,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[50640\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will outline the opportunities that persons in lower grades of the Public Service have been afforded ion contributing to the reforms of the public service as sought in the Public Service Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2189,"content":"<p>The Department of Defence places a significant emphasis on staff consultation and staff input at all levels in the development and implementation of action programmes to progress reforms in the Civil Service.

The first finding of the disease  was confirmed on 12 October 2012 in County Leitrim.  My Department has been resolute in its efforts to stop the spread of this disease and to prevent further infection.  The consignment, made up of some 30,000 plants imported from continental Europe, was planted over 11 sites.  The ash trees at each of these 11 sites were cut and destroyed by burning without delay last month.  Symptoms were found initially on the site in Leitrim and then subsequently in a small number of trees in a site in Galway, two sites in Tipperary, a site in Meath and a site in Monaghan, all from this one infected batch.  This work was undertaken with the co-operation of forest owners and forestry contractors and supervised by Departmental Forestry Inspectors.  <\/p><p>  Voluntary measures agreed with forestry stakeholders, the nursery sector and hurley makers to prevent the importation of infected material from the continent has now been superseded by robust legislation.  This legislation, introduced simultaneously with Northern Ireland, makes it an offence to import plants from areas known to have <i>Chalara fraxinea. <\/i>  Furthermore, the movement of plants within the country are now also subject to plant passport requirements.  Legislation, was also signed into law, which control ash wood movement into Ireland, including firewood and hurley ash.  Under the legislation ash wood may enter the State if (1) it comes from an area free of the disease or (2) its free of outer round surface (including bark) or (3) its kiln dried below 20% moisture. <\/p><p>  In terms of future actions, site surveys of the ash estate are continuing this week.  These surveys on the health of our ash trees will focus on sites which are at most risk from infection.  These will include recently planted forests which used material imported ash plants from the continent.  Examinations of ash imported wood and planting material will also be increased to enforce recently enacted legislation.<\/p><p>  In relation to specific biosecurity measures to be observed where the disease is suspected or where ash surveys are being carried out the Department currently recommend the following hygiene measures.  In relation to footwear, it is recommended to wash off all soil and plant debris from boots.  Boots should then be sprayed with disinfectant and used water should be disposed of onto an area where the water will not run into a watercourse.  In relation to clothing, it is recommended to check all clothing and remove any plant material.

The Committee comprise representatives of industry and processors and is chaired by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&WFPO).  The Department is not represented on the Committee nor is any other State agency.  However, the Marine Institute advises the Committee from time to time on scientific issues relating to the stock and was very involved with the Committee in the preparation of a Rebuilding Plan for the Stock which was accepted by the Minister and submitted to the EU Commission.  <\/p><p>  As part of the recovery plan for Celtic Sea Herring stock the CSHMAC recommended the establishment in 2006 of a restricted fishery for vessels under 50ft in overall length in the Dunmore East spawning area to assist with the provision of scientific information on the stock.  From 2007 to 2011, 8% of the overall Celtic Sea Herring quota was allotted to the fishery.  In the years to 2007 to 2010 an average of 25 vessels booked into the fishery, a number of which subsequently chose not to participate.  In 2011 this increased to 40 vessels and in 2012 the number booking in increased to 72 vessels.  Most of these vessels had never participated in the Sentinel Fishery before.<\/p><p>  As part of the revised Ministerial policy on Celtic Sea Herring announced in June 2012, the proportion of Herring quota allocated to the Sentinel was increased to 11% of the national quota, which is the maximum amount that the fishery can sustain, as advised by the Marine Institute.  At the same time, a whitefish and shellfish preclusion was introduced for participants for the duration of the fishery.<\/p><p>  As the maximum quota to this fishery is restricted by the scientific advice available, the possible quota allocations are greatly impacted of the number of vessels booking in.  The CSHMAC, having regard to the number of vessels booking-in and the amount of quota available, recommended a set of management arrangements agreed by all industry representatives on the committee for 2012.  I accepted these recommendations.<\/p><p>  In view of the changes to herring fisheries in 2012, I provided vessels booked into the fishery with the opportunity to book out of the fishery, without penalty, by Friday 9 November as the individual allocations available were known at the time.  The arrangements in place including the size categories of vessels for allocations, were recommended by the CSHMAC.  The Department brought the matter to the attention of the CSHMAC, who has advised the that tier categories are set out on a pilot basis for 2012 and the committee intends to propose changes to area of categorisation for 2013, including the issue of imperial Vs decimal vessel sizing.  <\/p><p>  Until I have an opportunity to examine the proposals from the CSHMAC and decide on clarifications, if any, to the current situation, the imperial measurement system will continue to apply.

The Committee comprise representatives of industry and  processors and is chaired by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&WFPO). The Department is not represented on the Committee nor is any other State agency.  However, the Marine Institute advises the Committee from time to time on scientific issues relating to the stock and was very involved with the Committee in the  preparation of a Rebuilding Plan for the Stock which was accepted by the Minister and submitted to the EU Commission.  <\/p><p>As part of the recovery plan for Celtic Sea Herring stock the CSHMAC recommended the establishment in 2006 of a restricted fishery for vessels under 50ft in overall length in the Dunmore East spawning area to assist with the provision of scientific information on the stock. From 2007 to 2011, 8% of the overall Celtic Sea Herring quota was allotted to the fishery. In the years to 2007 to 2010 an average of 25 vessels booked into the fishery, a number of which subsequently chose not to participate. In 2011 this increased to 40 vessels and in  2012 the number booking in increased to 72 vessels  , most of these vessels, including the one referred to by the Deputy had never participated in the Sentinel Fishery before.<\/p><p>  As part of the revised Ministerial policy on Celtic Sea Herring announced in June 2012, the proportion of Herring quota allocated to the Sentinel was increased to 11% of the national quota, which is the maximum amount that the fishery can sustain as advised by the Marine Institute. At the same time a whitefish and shellfish preclusion was introduced for participants for the duration of the fishery.<\/p><p>  As the maximum quota to this fishery is restricted by the scientific advice available, the possible quota allocations are greatly impacted of the number of vessels booking in.<\/p><p>  The CSHMAC having regard to the number of vessels booking-in and the amount of quota available recommended a set of management arrangements agreed by all the industry representatives on the committee for 2012. I accepted these recommendations.<\/p><p>  In view of the changes to herring fisheries in 2012, I provided vessels booked into the fishery with the opportunity to book out of the fishery, without penalty by Friday 9 November as the quota available was known at the time. The vessel referred to by the Deputy did not exercise this option.<\/p><p>  The vessel in question measures less than 30ft in length overall, therefore under the current agreed management arrangements the vessel falls into the &lt;30 ft category for quota allocation.  These arrangements in place were recommended by the CSHMAC.   <\/p><p>  The Department brought the matter to the attention of the CSHMAC who have advised the size categories are set out are on a pilot basis for 2012 and the committee proposes to propose changes to  area of categorisation for 2013 including the issue of imperial Vs decimal vessel sizing.  <\/p><p>  Until I have an opportunity to examine the proposals from the CSHMAC and decide on clarifications if any to the current situation, the imperial measurement system will continue to apply.   It is important to point out that any changes introduced will be based on a full evaluation taking account of the situation of all vessels and the proper and rational management of this fishery.  Accordingly, the possible impact of any changes on individual  vessels  can not be anticipated.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Appeals","counter":2263,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2264,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[49685\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a decision will be made on an appeal of a decision to refuse disadvantaged area scheme in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2265,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number, their derogation applications having been unsuccessful, who have now appealed my Department&rsquo;s decision to the recently constituted, independently chaired, DAS Appeals Committee.

The hotline shall be available on the number 116 000.\"  The same Directive also requires Member States to \"ensure that citizens are adequately informed of the existence and use of services provided under the 116 numbering range, in particular through initiatives specifically targeting persons travelling between Member States.\"  The hotline service will operate on two levels: the reporting of a missing child to the relevant authorities - in this case, the Garda - and the provision of emotional support to parents of missing children.  Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline.  My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to advance this matter.  Following cross-departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project Team, ComReg, which has responsibility for the allocation of this number in Ireland, has now allocated the number to the ISPCC.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999\/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.  In the interim the ISPCC has developed, with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an interim response that is currently heard if one rings the 116000 number.  The number advises callers to report a missing child to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and if a child is calling for assistance, to contact the ISPCC.  It is essential that the hotline service is operated in accordance with all best practice standards.  In order to fulfil this, the ISPCC have advised that a phased implementation will be necessary.  They envisage that the number will become operational in December 2012 from 22:00-16:00, 7 days a week, and will be operating on a 24-hour basis by February 2013.  This will be considered a 'pilot' phase.  This will give the ISPCC the time to complete the necessary training, develop and implement formal relationships with statutory authorities, overcome technical troubleshooting and prepare a 116 000 service launch and awareness campaign.  It is intended that an official launch will take place on 25 May 2013, which is International Missing Children Day.  The service launch bears particular importance as it is crucial that the public understand this is a support service rather than an emergency service.  The service launch will comprise of a media and event launch, face to face outreaches by ISPCC service staff and promotional materials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":2362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRZ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":2363,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[49647\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the amount currently being spent on, or budgeted for by State agencies under her remit for spending, on the areas of communication, public relations, consultancy, advertising and human resources; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2364,"content":"<p>Four agencies are funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote: the Adoption Authority of Ireland; the Family Support Agency; the National Educational Welfare Board; and the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office.

Some 600 organisations are funded each year.  These services aim to support people to deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships, to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation and to support families who have experienced the death of a family member.  Over 17,000 individual counselling sessions were delivered within Family Resource Centres in 2011.  Of these individual counselling sessions, over 4,000 concerned bereavement.  In 2011, the Family Support Agency provided funding of &euro;8,800 to the organisation in question under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations for the provision of counselling services.  In addition, the Family Support Agency last year provided &euro;10,000 to the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network to fund a scoping study on the feasibility and necessity of a bereavement network.  I subsequently launched such a Network in July 2012.  The Network is a hub for those working with bereaved children, young people and their families and aims to improve access to bereavement information, allow for the sharing of expertise, knowledge and experience and improve the range and quality of bereavement support available to children, young people and, crucially, those caring for them.  In this respect it is very welcome.  The Network is being hosted for an initial period by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  It will be the subject of an interim review after two years and an evaluation after five years.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy was part of the Steering Committee which oversaw the development and completion of the scoping study on the establishment of the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network.  The Network is in the early stages of development and is currently inviting members, with a target of 70 members set for the first year.  I am advised by the Family Support Agency that it provides funding to many of the members of the Network and that any collaboration which improves efficiencies is to be welcomed.  Finally, the Deputy will wish to note that the Government has previously announced that the functions of the Family Support Agency will transfer to the new Child and Family Support Agency upon its establishment in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform","counter":2382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRZ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2383,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[50638\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRZ02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline the opportunities that persons in lower grades of the Public Service have been afforded ion contributing to the reforms of the public service as sought in the Public Service Agreement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2384,"content":"<p>The objective of the Public Service Agreement is to ensure that the Public Service continues its contribution to the return of economic growth and economic prosperity while delivering excellence in service to the Irish public.

for as long as possible. This objective is realised through a range of Home Care supports, or other measures such as Day or Respite Care facilities. These services are core to not only supporting the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people , but also can alleviate pressures elsewhere in the wider care system.  In addition, we also support access, as appropriate, to Long or Short-Term Residential Care. <\/p><p>  The demand for these services, which are often delivered in partnership with non-statutory agencies, will continue as the demographics, and the complex needs, of older people change. For example, at present, there are approximately 535,000  people over age 65 (11% of total population).  This is projected to rise to about 775,000 by 2021, 910,000 by 2026, and to around 1.4 million by 2041 (22% of the total population).  The number over age 85 is expected to quadruple from approximately 110,000 in 2006 to 444,000 by 2041.  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of services for vulnerable older people is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times. In this regard, 2012 has been a very challenging year for the health services generally, and the reality is that this will continue to be the position for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>  It remains the case, however, that investment in this area is significant by any standard, as the HSE Service Plan 2012 provided in the region of &euro;1.4 billion overall for Services for Older People. This includes Long Term Residential Care, Home Care Supports and Day or Respite Care.  All measures are being taken by the HSE to ensure that as many people as possible continue to receive appropriate services, in line with assessed individual needs.  The position in relation to 2013, or beyond, is obviously subject to the annual Estimates process, in the light of evolving resources and services priorities for the health sector overall.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the difficult economic situation to be overcome, we intend to carry through insofar as possible the commitments relating to older people contained in the agreed Programme for Government.  These include a review of Fair Deal to consider, amongst other things, an extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), together with its overall sustainability.  The review will be completed in 2013.  We will also complete the National Positive Ageing Strategy, so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives. This measure will set the strategic tone for future years, across a number of Government Departments and agencies.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health reviews on a regular basis the projected future requirements for the health service, including policies and services relating to older people.

The role of the National Office is to oversee the implementation of <i>Reach Out<\/i> and to coordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.

The remaining &#8364;5 million is available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.<\/p><p>  To assist my Department in advising the Government on the formation of hospital groups, in June this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups.  The Strategic Board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.<\/p><p>  A Project Team was established to make recommendations on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions for the consideration of the Strategic Board.  The consultation process to inform the project team has been rigorous and comprehensive.  It has included meetings with every acute hospital, including consultations on two separate occasions with each hospital in the South East region; it has involved the receipt of a significant volume of formal submissions from hospitals, clinicians, regulatory bodies and citizens, all of which have been considered.<\/p><p>  The organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the on-going development of the HSE Clinical Programmes and by the Smaller Hospitals Framework, which defines the role of the smaller hospitals and  is intrinsically linked to the on-going work regarding the development of hospital groups.<\/p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals.  It is about bringing together groups of hospitals into single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery; it is about ensuring that hospital groups are broadly comparable in size and scope so that they can attract high-quality staff and trainees across all health care specialities and professions; it is about creating efficiencies by using common business processes and economies of scale and avoiding unnecessary duplication; most importantly of all, it is about maximising the range of services available to deliver internationally comparable quality care for patients, regardless of where they live.<\/p><p>  I am hopeful that I will receive the report of the Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups later this month and that I will be able to bring this matter to my cabinet colleagues for decision shortly thereafter.  Finally, it should be remembered that the hospital groups are an interim, collaborative measure pending the legislation required to establish hospital trusts: before those trusts are established, the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRBB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Acquired Infections","counter":2485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRBB03050"},{"type":"question","counter":2486,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[49698\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRBB03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the hospitals and or healthcare centres in which Legionnaires disease occurred in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2487,"content":"<p>Since 2010 there have been three cases of patients having Legionella's Disease as a consequence of being a patient of a HSE healthcare facility.

It is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.  All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015.  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. <\/p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The e current fee structure is as follows: <\/p><p>A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;<\/p><p>An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax.<\/p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation. e greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. e twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the minimum required to enable the Council to operate.  The fee charged by the HSCPC, which  is mindful of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015, is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  It is calculated approximately on the basis of the overall projected costs of the agency when fully operational divided by the total number of registrants and then further reduced to &euro;295 to take account of the Council's phased establishment.  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.<\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:<\/p><p>Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting,  the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting is concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;<\/p><p>The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;<\/p><p>Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost-effective operating system is will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRDD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":2616,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRDD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":2617,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[50132\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300076#WRDD03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the progress made on the implementation of the EU Directive 2010\/63\/EU on the use of animals for scientific and medical research purposes; and if he will confirm if the existing primary legislation here, which is in many aspects stronger than the provisions of the EU Directive, will be retained in the process of incorporating the Directive.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2618,"content":"<p>I do not accept that existing measures relating to the protection of animals used for scientific purposes set out in the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act as amended provide a higher level of protection to those set out in Directive 2010\/63\/EU.

The Directive needs to be considered in its entirety to appreciate the full scope of the protections afforded to animals.  These include mandatory provisions that will minimise the number of animals used and require alternatives to be used wherever possible, while ensuring a level playing field for EU industry and enhancing the quality of research conducted in the EU.

Personnel are being offered the opportunity for reassignment within their current locations where this is feasible, together with opportunities for re-training and re-skilling.  In addition, a review system has been put in place whereby personnel who are unhappy with a proposed relocation can seek a review of a decision.  Inevitably, given the scale of the reorganisation, it will be necessary for some staff to move to new locations.  <\/p><p>  The creation of a new two Brigade structure for the Army under the reorganisation has resulted in Combat Support Units being reduced from nine units to six.  The Field Engineer companies based in McKee Barracks fall into this category, and the Headquarters element and Field Engineer Company are being relocated to Custume Barracks, Athlone.  Forty-five personnel from within the 2 Field Engineer Company will therefore have to move with their unit to Athlone, or be reassigned to alternative appointments available in other Units in the Dublin Area.  Pending the full rollout of the reorganisation plan it is not possible to say how many personnel can be facilitated though reassignment process.  However, there is no question of families being moved or being required to move arising from the reorganisation and this is a matter for each individual to decide.  The reality is that many Defence Forces personnel currently assigned to McKee barracks are not resident in Dublin and commute on a daily basis, which is a common feature across both the public and private sector of a modern, flexible and mobile working population in Ireland today.<\/p><p>  All members of the Defence Forces reassigned under the Defence Forces Reorganisation Plan 2012 are entitled to Change of Station Allowance in circumstances where they meet the qualifying criteria.  It is not possible at this point to estimate the total figure that will require to be paid in Change of Station allowance as this will be contingent on a number of factors including whether individuals will actually opt to physically relocate home or not. <\/p><p>  The Government is very much aware that the major re-organisation currently underway is a difficult process for many serving members of the Defence Forces and their families, who are being required to make decisions under the current reorganisation that they would not otherwise have to make, or in different times have had to consider.  Unfortunately, this is the consequence and reality of the reforms necessarily taking place across the public service today.  It must be reiterated that there is no painless way to fundamentally reorganise the Defence Forces whilst maintaining essential military capabilities and it has become necessary to mandatorily move some personnel whose units are being disestablished or relocated and who cannot be accommodated in their current location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRV03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Service Reform","counter":2736,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2737,"qnumday":517,"qnumall":"[50640\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will outline the opportunities that persons in lower grades of the Public Service have been afforded ion contributing to the reforms of the public service as sought in the Public Service Agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2738,"content":"<p>The Department of Defence places a significant emphasis on staff consultation and staff input at all levels in the development and implementation of action programmes to progress reforms in the Civil Service.

The first finding of the disease  was confirmed on 12 October 2012 in County Leitrim.  My Department has been resolute in its efforts to stop the spread of this disease and to prevent further infection.  The consignment, made up of some 30,000 plants imported from continental Europe, was planted over 11 sites.  The ash trees at each of these 11 sites were cut and destroyed by burning without delay last month.  Symptoms were found initially on the site in Leitrim and then subsequently in a small number of trees in a site in Galway, two sites in Tipperary, a site in Meath and a site in Monaghan, all from this one infected batch.  This work was undertaken with the co-operation of forest owners and forestry contractors and supervised by Departmental Forestry Inspectors.  <\/p><p>  Voluntary measures agreed with forestry stakeholders, the nursery sector and hurley makers to prevent the importation of infected material from the continent has now been superseded by robust legislation.  This legislation, introduced simultaneously with Northern Ireland, makes it an offence to import plants from areas known to have <i>Chalara fraxinea. <\/i>  Furthermore, the movement of plants within the country are now also subject to plant passport requirements.  Legislation, was also signed into law, which control ash wood movement into Ireland, including firewood and hurley ash.  Under the legislation ash wood may enter the State if (1) it comes from an area free of the disease or (2) its free of outer round surface (including bark) or (3) its kiln dried below 20% moisture. <\/p><p>  In terms of future actions, site surveys of the ash estate are continuing this week.  These surveys on the health of our ash trees will focus on sites which are at most risk from infection.  These will include recently planted forests which used material imported ash plants from the continent.  Examinations of ash imported wood and planting material will also be increased to enforce recently enacted legislation.<\/p><p>  In relation to specific biosecurity measures to be observed where the disease is suspected or where ash surveys are being carried out the Department currently recommend the following hygiene measures.  In relation to footwear, it is recommended to wash off all soil and plant debris from boots.  Boots should then be sprayed with disinfectant and used water should be disposed of onto an area where the water will not run into a watercourse.  In relation to clothing, it is recommended to check all clothing and remove any plant material.

The Committee comprise representatives of industry and processors and is chaired by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&WFPO).  The Department is not represented on the Committee nor is any other State agency.  However, the Marine Institute advises the Committee from time to time on scientific issues relating to the stock and was very involved with the Committee in the preparation of a Rebuilding Plan for the Stock which was accepted by the Minister and submitted to the EU Commission.  <\/p><p>  As part of the recovery plan for Celtic Sea Herring stock the CSHMAC recommended the establishment in 2006 of a restricted fishery for vessels under 50ft in overall length in the Dunmore East spawning area to assist with the provision of scientific information on the stock.  From 2007 to 2011, 8% of the overall Celtic Sea Herring quota was allotted to the fishery.  In the years to 2007 to 2010 an average of 25 vessels booked into the fishery, a number of which subsequently chose not to participate.  In 2011 this increased to 40 vessels and in 2012 the number booking in increased to 72 vessels.  Most of these vessels had never participated in the Sentinel Fishery before.<\/p><p>  As part of the revised Ministerial policy on Celtic Sea Herring announced in June 2012, the proportion of Herring quota allocated to the Sentinel was increased to 11% of the national quota, which is the maximum amount that the fishery can sustain, as advised by the Marine Institute.  At the same time, a whitefish and shellfish preclusion was introduced for participants for the duration of the fishery.<\/p><p>  As the maximum quota to this fishery is restricted by the scientific advice available, the possible quota allocations are greatly impacted of the number of vessels booking in.  The CSHMAC, having regard to the number of vessels booking-in and the amount of quota available, recommended a set of management arrangements agreed by all industry representatives on the committee for 2012.  I accepted these recommendations.<\/p><p>  In view of the changes to herring fisheries in 2012, I provided vessels booked into the fishery with the opportunity to book out of the fishery, without penalty, by Friday 9 November as the individual allocations available were known at the time.  The arrangements in place including the size categories of vessels for allocations, were recommended by the CSHMAC.  The Department brought the matter to the attention of the CSHMAC, who has advised the that tier categories are set out on a pilot basis for 2012 and the committee intends to propose changes to area of categorisation for 2013, including the issue of imperial Vs decimal vessel sizing.  <\/p><p>  Until I have an opportunity to examine the proposals from the CSHMAC and decide on clarifications, if any, to the current situation, the imperial measurement system will continue to apply.  It is important to point out that any changes introduced will be based on a full evaluation, taking account of the situation of all vessels and the proper and rational management of this fishery.  Accordingly, the possible impact of any changes on individual vessels can not be anticipated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRW04300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":2799,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRW04350"},{"type":"question","counter":2800,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[49620\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRW04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Galway will be paid their 2012 disadvantaged area based payment and single farm payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2801,"content":"<p>The person concerned is an applicant under the 2012 Single Payment and Disadvantaged Area Schemes.<\/p><p>  In order to meet EU requirements, the application concerned was one of a number which was selected for inspection.

The Committee comprise representatives of industry and  processors and is chaired by the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation (IS&WFPO). The Department is not represented on the Committee nor is any other State agency.  However, the Marine Institute advises the Committee from time to time on scientific issues relating to the stock and was very involved with the Committee in the  preparation of a Rebuilding Plan for the Stock which was accepted by the Minister and submitted to the EU Commission.  <\/p><p>As part of the recovery plan for Celtic Sea Herring stock the CSHMAC recommended the establishment in 2006 of a restricted fishery for vessels under 50ft in overall length in the Dunmore East spawning area to assist with the provision of scientific information on the stock. From 2007 to 2011, 8% of the overall Celtic Sea Herring quota was allotted to the fishery. In the years to 2007 to 2010 an average of 25 vessels booked into the fishery, a number of which subsequently chose not to participate. In 2011 this increased to 40 vessels and in  2012 the number booking in increased to 72 vessels  , most of these vessels, including the one referred to by the Deputy had never participated in the Sentinel Fishery before.<\/p><p>  As part of the revised Ministerial policy on Celtic Sea Herring announced in June 2012, the proportion of Herring quota allocated to the Sentinel was increased to 11% of the national quota, which is the maximum amount that the fishery can sustain as advised by the Marine Institute. At the same time a whitefish and shellfish preclusion was introduced for participants for the duration of the fishery.<\/p><p>  As the maximum quota to this fishery is restricted by the scientific advice available, the possible quota allocations are greatly impacted of the number of vessels booking in.<\/p><p>  The CSHMAC having regard to the number of vessels booking-in and the amount of quota available recommended a set of management arrangements agreed by all the industry representatives on the committee for 2012. I accepted these recommendations.<\/p><p>  In view of the changes to herring fisheries in 2012, I provided vessels booked into the fishery with the opportunity to book out of the fishery, without penalty by Friday 9 November as the quota available was known at the time. The vessel referred to by the Deputy did not exercise this option.<\/p><p>  The vessel in question measures less than 30ft in length overall, therefore under the current agreed management arrangements the vessel falls into the &lt;30 ft category for quota allocation.  These arrangements in place were recommended by the CSHMAC.   <\/p><p>  The Department brought the matter to the attention of the CSHMAC who have advised the size categories are set out are on a pilot basis for 2012 and the committee proposes to propose changes to  area of categorisation for 2013 including the issue of imperial Vs decimal vessel sizing.  <\/p><p>  Until I have an opportunity to examine the proposals from the CSHMAC and decide on clarifications if any to the current situation, the imperial measurement system will continue to apply.   It is important to point out that any changes introduced will be based on a full evaluation taking account of the situation of all vessels and the proper and rational management of this fishery.  Accordingly, the possible impact of any changes on individual  vessels  can not be anticipated.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Appeals","counter":2812,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2813,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[49685\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a decision will be made on an appeal of a decision to refuse disadvantaged area scheme in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2814,"content":"<p>The person named is one of a number, their derogation applications having been unsuccessful, who have now appealed my Department&rsquo;s decision to the recently constituted, independently chaired, DAS Appeals Committee.

The hotline shall be available on the number 116 000.\"  The same Directive also requires Member States to \"ensure that citizens are adequately informed of the existence and use of services provided under the 116 numbering range, in particular through initiatives specifically targeting persons travelling between Member States.\"  The hotline service will operate on two levels: the reporting of a missing child to the relevant authorities - in this case, the Garda - and the provision of emotional support to parents of missing children.  Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline.  My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to advance this matter.  Following cross-departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project Team, ComReg, which has responsibility for the allocation of this number in Ireland, has now allocated the number to the ISPCC.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999\/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.  In the interim the ISPCC has developed, with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an interim response that is currently heard if one rings the 116000 number.  The number advises callers to report a missing child to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and if a child is calling for assistance, to contact the ISPCC.  It is essential that the hotline service is operated in accordance with all best practice standards.  In order to fulfil this, the ISPCC have advised that a phased implementation will be necessary.  They envisage that the number will become operational in December 2012 from 22:00-16:00, 7 days a week, and will be operating on a 24-hour basis by February 2013.  This will be considered a 'pilot' phase.  This will give the ISPCC the time to complete the necessary training, develop and implement formal relationships with statutory authorities, overcome technical troubleshooting and prepare a 116 000 service launch and awareness campaign.  It is intended that an official launch will take place on 25 May 2013, which is International Missing Children Day.  The service launch bears particular importance as it is crucial that the public understand this is a support service rather than an emergency service.  The service launch will comprise of a media and event launch, face to face outreaches by ISPCC service staff and promotional materials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":2911,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRZ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":2912,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[49647\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the amount currently being spent on, or budgeted for by State agencies under her remit for spending, on the areas of communication, public relations, consultancy, advertising and human resources; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2913,"content":"<p>Four agencies are funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote: the Adoption Authority of Ireland; the Family Support Agency; the National Educational Welfare Board; and the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office.

Some 600 organisations are funded each year.  These services aim to support people to deal with difficulties they are experiencing in their relationships, to help children whose lives have been affected by parental separation and to support families who have experienced the death of a family member.  Over 17,000 individual counselling sessions were delivered within Family Resource Centres in 2011.  Of these individual counselling sessions, over 4,000 concerned bereavement.  In 2011, the Family Support Agency provided funding of &euro;8,800 to the organisation in question under the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations for the provision of counselling services.  In addition, the Family Support Agency last year provided &euro;10,000 to the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network to fund a scoping study on the feasibility and necessity of a bereavement network.  I subsequently launched such a Network in July 2012.  The Network is a hub for those working with bereaved children, young people and their families and aims to improve access to bereavement information, allow for the sharing of expertise, knowledge and experience and improve the range and quality of bereavement support available to children, young people and, crucially, those caring for them.  In this respect it is very welcome.  The Network is being hosted for an initial period by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  It will be the subject of an interim review after two years and an evaluation after five years.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy was part of the Steering Committee which oversaw the development and completion of the scoping study on the establishment of the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network.  The Network is in the early stages of development and is currently inviting members, with a target of 70 members set for the first year.  I am advised by the Family Support Agency that it provides funding to many of the members of the Network and that any collaboration which improves efficiencies is to be welcomed.  Finally, the Deputy will wish to note that the Government has previously announced that the functions of the Family Support Agency will transfer to the new Child and Family Support Agency upon its establishment in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform","counter":2931,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRZ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2932,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[50638\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRZ02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline the opportunities that persons in lower grades of the Public Service have been afforded ion contributing to the reforms of the public service as sought in the Public Service Agreement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2933,"content":"<p>The objective of the Public Service Agreement is to ensure that the Public Service continues its contribution to the return of economic growth and economic prosperity while delivering excellence in service to the Irish public.

for as long as possible. This objective is realised through a range of Home Care supports, or other measures such as Day or Respite Care facilities. These services are core to not only supporting the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people , but also can alleviate pressures elsewhere in the wider care system.  In addition, we also support access, as appropriate, to Long or Short-Term Residential Care. <\/p><p>  The demand for these services, which are often delivered in partnership with non-statutory agencies, will continue as the demographics, and the complex needs, of older people change. For example, at present, there are approximately 535,000  people over age 65 (11% of total population).  This is projected to rise to about 775,000 by 2021, 910,000 by 2026, and to around 1.4 million by 2041 (22% of the total population).  The number over age 85 is expected to quadruple from approximately 110,000 in 2006 to 444,000 by 2041.  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of services for vulnerable older people is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times. In this regard, 2012 has been a very challenging year for the health services generally, and the reality is that this will continue to be the position for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>  It remains the case, however, that investment in this area is significant by any standard, as the HSE Service Plan 2012 provided in the region of &euro;1.4 billion overall for Services for Older People. This includes Long Term Residential Care, Home Care Supports and Day or Respite Care.  All measures are being taken by the HSE to ensure that as many people as possible continue to receive appropriate services, in line with assessed individual needs.  The position in relation to 2013, or beyond, is obviously subject to the annual Estimates process, in the light of evolving resources and services priorities for the health sector overall.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the difficult economic situation to be overcome, we intend to carry through insofar as possible the commitments relating to older people contained in the agreed Programme for Government.  These include a review of Fair Deal to consider, amongst other things, an extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), together with its overall sustainability.  The review will be completed in 2013.  We will also complete the National Positive Ageing Strategy, so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives. This measure will set the strategic tone for future years, across a number of Government Departments and agencies.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health reviews on a regular basis the projected future requirements for the health service, including policies and services relating to older people.

This function is currently being carried out by the HSE's National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) which was established in 2005 on foot of a recommendation in <i>Reach Out<\/i> our National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention.  The role of the National Office is to oversee the implementation of <i>Reach Out<\/i> and to coordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.

The remaining &#8364;5 million is available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.<\/p><p>  To assist my Department in advising the Government on the formation of hospital groups, in June this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups.  The Strategic Board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.<\/p><p>  A Project Team was established to make recommendations on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions for the consideration of the Strategic Board.  The consultation process to inform the project team has been rigorous and comprehensive.  It has included meetings with every acute hospital, including consultations on two separate occasions with each hospital in the South East region; it has involved the receipt of a significant volume of formal submissions from hospitals, clinicians, regulatory bodies and citizens, all of which have been considered.<\/p><p>  The organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the on-going development of the HSE Clinical Programmes and by the Smaller Hospitals Framework, which defines the role of the smaller hospitals and  is intrinsically linked to the on-going work regarding the development of hospital groups.<\/p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals.  It is about bringing together groups of hospitals into single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery; it is about ensuring that hospital groups are broadly comparable in size and scope so that they can attract high-quality staff and trainees across all health care specialities and professions; it is about creating efficiencies by using common business processes and economies of scale and avoiding unnecessary duplication; most importantly of all, it is about maximising the range of services available to deliver internationally comparable quality care for patients, regardless of where they live.<\/p><p>  I am hopeful that I will receive the report of the Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups later this month and that I will be able to bring this matter to my cabinet colleagues for decision shortly thereafter.  Finally, it should be remembered that the hospital groups are an interim, collaborative measure pending the legislation required to establish hospital trusts: before those trusts are established, the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRBB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Acquired Infections","counter":3034,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRBB03050"},{"type":"question","counter":3035,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[49698\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRBB03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the hospitals and or healthcare centres in which Legionnaires disease occurred in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3036,"content":"<p>Since 2010 there have been three cases of patients having Legionella's Disease as a consequence of being a patient of a HSE healthcare facility.

It is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.  All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015.  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. <\/p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The e current fee structure is as follows: <\/p><p>A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;<\/p><p>An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax.<\/p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation. e greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. e twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the minimum required to enable the Council to operate.  The fee charged by the HSCPC, which  is mindful of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015, is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  It is calculated approximately on the basis of the overall projected costs of the agency when fully operational divided by the total number of registrants and then further reduced to &euro;295 to take account of the Council's phased establishment.  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.<\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:<\/p><p>Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting,  the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting is concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;<\/p><p>The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;<\/p><p>Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost-effective operating system is will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRDD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":3165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRDD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":3166,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[50132\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300077#WRDD03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the progress made on the implementation of the EU Directive 2010\/63\/EU on the use of animals for scientific and medical research purposes; and if he will confirm if the existing primary legislation here, which is in many aspects stronger than the provisions of the EU Directive, will be retained in the process of incorporating the Directive.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3167,"content":"<p>I do not accept that existing measures relating to the protection of animals used for scientific purposes set out in the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act as amended provide a higher level of protection to those set out in Directive 2010\/63\/EU.

The Directive needs to be considered in its entirety to appreciate the full scope of the protections afforded to animals.  These include mandatory provisions that will minimise the number of animals used and require alternatives to be used wherever possible, while ensuring a level playing field for EU industry and enhancing the quality of research conducted in the EU.

The first finding of the disease  was confirmed on 12 October 2012 in County Leitrim.  My Department has been resolute in its efforts to stop the spread of this disease and to prevent further infection.  The consignment, made up of some 30,000 plants imported from continental Europe, was planted over 11 sites.  The ash trees at each of these 11 sites were cut and destroyed by burning without delay last month.  Symptoms were found initially on the site in Leitrim and then subsequently in a small number of trees in a site in Galway, two sites in Tipperary, a site in Meath and a site in Monaghan, all from this one infected batch.  This work was undertaken with the co-operation of forest owners and forestry contractors and supervised by Departmental Forestry Inspectors.  <\/p><p>  Voluntary measures agreed with forestry stakeholders, the nursery sector and hurley makers to prevent the importation of infected material from the continent has now been superseded by robust legislation.  This legislation, introduced simultaneously with Northern Ireland, makes it an offence to import plants from areas known to have <i>Chalara fraxinea. <\/i>  Furthermore, the movement of plants within the country are now also subject to plant passport requirements.  Legislation, was also signed into law, which control ash wood movement into Ireland, including firewood and hurley ash.  Under the legislation ash wood may enter the State if (1) it comes from an area free of the disease or (2) its free of outer round surface (including bark) or (3) its kiln dried below 20% moisture. <\/p><p>  In terms of future actions, site surveys of the ash estate are continuing this week.  These surveys on the health of our ash trees will focus on sites which are at most risk from infection.  These will include recently planted forests which used material imported ash plants from the continent.  Examinations of ash imported wood and planting material will also be increased to enforce recently enacted legislation.<\/p><p>  In relation to specific biosecurity measures to be observed where the disease is suspected or where ash surveys are being carried out the Department currently recommend the following hygiene measures.  In relation to footwear, it is recommended to wash off all soil and plant debris from boots.

The Department is not represented on the Committee nor is any other State agency.  However, the Marine Institute advises the Committee from time to time on scientific issues relating to the stock and was very involved with the Committee in the preparation of a Rebuilding Plan for the Stock which was accepted by the Minister and submitted to the EU Commission.  <\/p><p>  As part of the recovery plan for Celtic Sea Herring stock the CSHMAC recommended the establishment in 2006 of a restricted fishery for vessels under 50ft in overall length in the Dunmore East spawning area to assist with the provision of scientific information on the stock.  From 2007 to 2011, 8% of the overall Celtic Sea Herring quota was allotted to the fishery.  In the years to 2007 to 2010 an average of 25 vessels booked into the fishery, a number of which subsequently chose not to participate.  In 2011 this increased to 40 vessels and in 2012 the number booking in increased to 72 vessels.  Most of these vessels had never participated in the Sentinel Fishery before.<\/p><p>  As part of the revised Ministerial policy on Celtic Sea Herring announced in June 2012, the proportion of Herring quota allocated to the Sentinel was increased to 11% of the national quota, which is the maximum amount that the fishery can sustain, as advised by the Marine Institute.

The Department brought the matter to the attention of the CSHMAC, who has advised the that tier categories are set out on a pilot basis for 2012 and the committee intends to propose changes to area of categorisation for 2013, including the issue of imperial Vs decimal vessel sizing.  <\/p><p>  Until I have an opportunity to examine the proposals from the CSHMAC and decide on clarifications, if any, to the current situation, the imperial measurement system will continue to apply.

If fowl typhoid is suspected in a poultry farm that is approved for trade, approval will be suspended, and no further trade in poultry or hatching eggs originating from the farm can take place. Approval will be withdrawn if fowl typhoid is confirmed. It is obligatory to notify any suspicion of fowl typhoid to my Department.  An information leaflet on fowl typhoid has been posted to my Department&rsquo;s website and is available at www.agriculture.gov.ie.  This is in addition to the brochure on Biosecurity Information for Registered Poultry Flock Owners also on the website.

The hotline shall be available on the number 116 000.\"  The same Directive also requires Member States to \"ensure that citizens are adequately informed of the existence and use of services provided under the 116 numbering range, in particular through initiatives specifically targeting persons travelling between Member States.\"  The hotline service will operate on two levels: the reporting of a missing child to the relevant authorities - in this case, the Garda - and the provision of emotional support to parents of missing children.  Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline.  My Department established and is leading a cross-sectoral Project Team, including representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to advance this matter.  Following cross-departmental consultation and an examination of the issues involved by the Project Team, ComReg, which has responsibility for the allocation of this number in Ireland, has now allocated the number to the ISPCC.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the 116000 number is not an emergency number.  Emergency calls should always be directed to the 999\/112 number in the first instance, where the relevant emergency responses, including the recently launched Garda Missing Children Amber Alert mechanism, may be activated.  The establishment of the 116000 line will however, be of valuable support and assistance to families of missing children and to missing children themselves.  In the interim the ISPCC has developed, with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an interim response that is currently heard if one rings the 116000 number.  The number advises callers to report a missing child to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and if a child is calling for assistance, to contact the ISPCC.  It is essential that the hotline service is operated in accordance with all best practice standards.  In order to fulfil this, the ISPCC have advised that a phased implementation will be necessary.  They envisage that the number will become operational in December 2012 from 22:00-16:00, 7 days a week, and will be operating on a 24-hour basis by February 2013.  This will be considered a 'pilot' phase.  This will give the ISPCC the time to complete the necessary training, develop and implement formal relationships with statutory authorities, overcome technical troubleshooting and prepare a 116 000 service launch and awareness campaign.  It is intended that an official launch will take place on 25 May 2013, which is International Missing Children Day.  The service launch bears particular importance as it is crucial that the public understand this is a support service rather than an emergency service.  The service launch will comprise of a media and event launch, face to face outreaches by ISPCC service staff and promotional materials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300081#WRZ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":3406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300081#WRZ00550"},{"type":"question","counter":3407,"qnumday":574,"qnumall":"[49647\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300081#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will provide in tabular form the amount currently being spent on, or budgeted for by State agencies under her remit for spending, on the areas of communication, public relations, consultancy, advertising and human resources; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":3408,"content":"<p>Four agencies are funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote: the Adoption Authority of Ireland; the Family Support Agency; the National Educational Welfare Board; and the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office.

I subsequently launched such a Network in July 2012.  The Network is a hub for those working with bereaved children, young people and their families and aims to improve access to bereavement information, allow for the sharing of expertise, knowledge and experience and improve the range and quality of bereavement support available to children, young people and, crucially, those caring for them.  In this respect it is very welcome.  The Network is being hosted for an initial period by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  It will be the subject of an interim review after two years and an evaluation after five years.  The organisation referred to by the Deputy was part of the Steering Committee which oversaw the development and completion of the scoping study on the establishment of the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network.  The Network is in the early stages of development and is currently inviting members, with a target of 70 members set for the first year.  I am advised by the Family Support Agency that it provides funding to many of the members of the Network and that any collaboration which improves efficiencies is to be welcomed.  Finally, the Deputy will wish to note that the Government has previously announced that the functions of the Family Support Agency will transfer to the new Child and Family Support Agency upon its establishment in 2013. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300081#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Reform","counter":3426,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300081#WRZ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":3427,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[50638\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300081#WRZ02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will outline the opportunities that persons in lower grades of the Public Service have been afforded ion contributing to the reforms of the public service as sought in the Public Service Agreement; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1110","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":3428,"content":"<p>The objective of the Public Service Agreement is to ensure that the Public Service continues its contribution to the return of economic growth and economic prosperity while delivering excellence in service to the Irish public.

As such, I am anxious to ensure that staff at all levels are fully engaged with delivering strategic objectives for the Department.  I understand the Deputy is particularly interested in staff engagement at clerical and executive officer level in contributing to the reform agenda.  I am happy to inform the Deputy that these grades were represented in the development of my Department's Statement of Strategy which will guide the Department in responding flexibly and innovatively to changing circumstances.  Staff at all levels are talented and committed.  It is through their efforts that ambitions for children and young people set out in this Strategy will be achieved.  The human resource policies in my Department allow for full staff engagement on matters involving them.  For example, clerical and executive staff are involved in the Business Planning process in their respective units across the Department where clear goals and performance indicators for the year ahead are developed and agreed.  A new Partnership Committee has recently been established which involves a continuous commitment by employees to identify improvements in quality and efficiency and an acceptance by management that employees are stakeholders with rights and interests to be considered in the context of major decisions affecting their work and employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300081#WRZ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":3431,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300082#WRAA00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance Diet Supplement","counter":3430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300082#WRAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":3431,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[49560\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300082#WRAA00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the dietary supplement for children with coeliac disease at &euro;6.50 per month is regarded as sufficient; if consideration was given to the adequacy of the supplement in advance of the withdrawal of this support from those in receipt of medical cards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1052","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3432,"content":"<p>In the current financial environment the Health Service Executive (HSE) is facing a challenge to deliver services in a way that will minimise any adverse impact on patients and continue to protect, as far as possible, the most vulnerable citizens.

matter.","asker":"1048","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3478,"content":"<p>Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. This objective is realised through a range of Home Care supports, or other measures such as Day or Respite Care facilities. These services are core to not only supporting the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people , but also can alleviate pressures elsewhere in the wider care system.  In addition, we also support access, as appropriate, to Long or Short-Term Residential Care. <\/p><p>  The demand for these services, which are often delivered in partnership with non-statutory agencies, will continue as the demographics, and the complex needs, of older people change. For example, at present, there are approximately 535,000  people over age 65 (11% of total population).  This is projected to rise to about 775,000 by 2021, 910,000 by 2026, and to around 1.4 million by 2041 (22% of the total population).  The number over age 85 is expected to quadruple from approximately 110,000 in 2006 to 444,000 by 2041.  The capacity of the Health Service Executive to provide approved levels of services for vulnerable older people is continually reviewed in the context of overall resources available at particular times. In this regard, 2012 has been a very challenging year for the health services generally, and the reality is that this will continue to be the position for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>  It remains the case, however, that investment in this area is significant by any standard, as the HSE Service Plan 2012 provided in the region of &euro;1.4 billion overall for Services for Older People. This includes Long Term Residential Care, Home Care Supports and Day or Respite Care.  All measures are being taken by the HSE to ensure that as many people as possible continue to receive appropriate services, in line with assessed individual needs.  The position in relation to 2013, or beyond, is obviously subject to the annual Estimates process, in the light of evolving resources and services priorities for the health sector overall.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the difficult economic situation to be overcome, we intend to carry through insofar as possible the commitments relating to older people contained in the agreed Programme for Government.  These include a review of Fair Deal to consider, amongst other things, an extension of the scheme to community based services and to other sectors (Disability and Mental Health), together with its overall sustainability.  The review will be completed in 2013.  We will also complete the National Positive Ageing Strategy, so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives. This measure will set the strategic tone for future years, across a number of Government Departments and agencies.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health reviews on a regular basis the projected future requirements for the health service, including policies and services relating to older people. This process also takes account of relevant external studies or reports, which often can make a constructive contribution on how we as a society might meet the changing requirements of older people across all of Ireland in future years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300082#WRAA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3479,"content":"<p>Question No. 602 answered with Question No. 584.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":3480,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300082#WRAA03675"},{"type":"question","counter":3481,"qnumday":603,"qnumall":"[49559\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300082#WRAA03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to close the learning disability service based at Cloonamahon, County Sligo by 2018; if so, the location at which the users of the service will be accommodated; the role envisaged for the Cloonamahon campus in relation to health service provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3482,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300082#WRAA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":3483,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300082#WRAA03850"},{"type":"question","counter":3484,"qnumday":604,"qnumall":"[49594\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300082#WRAA03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to put in place a time limit on the validity of prescriptions issued; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3485,"content":"<p>Regulation 7(5) of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 as amended provides that prescriptions for medicinal products are valid for a period of six months from the date specified on the prescription.

The role of the National Office is to oversee the implementation of <i>Reach Out<\/i> and to coordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.

The remaining &#8364;5 million is available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.

The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.<\/p><p>  To assist my Department in advising the Government on the formation of hospital groups, in June this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups.  The Strategic Board is composed of representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.<\/p><p>  A Project Team was established to make recommendations on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions for the consideration of the Strategic Board.  The consultation process to inform the project team has been rigorous and comprehensive.  It has included meetings with every acute hospital, including consultations on two separate occasions with each hospital in the South East region; it has involved the receipt of a significant volume of formal submissions from hospitals, clinicians, regulatory bodies and citizens, all of which have been considered.<\/p><p>  The organisation of hospital services nationally, regionally and locally will be informed by the on-going development of the HSE Clinical Programmes and by the Smaller Hospitals Framework, which defines the role of the smaller hospitals and  is intrinsically linked to the on-going work regarding the development of hospital groups.<\/p><p>  The work on hospital groups is not about downgrading hospitals.  It is about bringing together groups of hospitals into single cohesive entities to allow maximum flexibility in management, budgets and service delivery; it is about ensuring that hospital groups are broadly comparable in size and scope so that they can attract high-quality staff and trainees across all health care specialities and professions; it is about creating efficiencies by using common business processes and economies of scale and avoiding unnecessary duplication; most importantly of all, it is about maximising the range of services available to deliver internationally comparable quality care for patients, regardless of where they live.<\/p><p>  I am hopeful that I will receive the report of the Strategic Board on the Establishment of Hospital Groups later this month and that I will be able to bring this matter to my cabinet colleagues for decision shortly thereafter.  Finally, it should be remembered that the hospital groups are an interim, collaborative measure pending the legislation required to establish hospital trusts: before those trusts are established, the composition and functioning of the Groups will be reviewed and if changes prove necessary then they will be made with Government approval when the hospital trusts are being formed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300083#WRBB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Acquired Infections","counter":3529,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300083#WRBB03050"},{"type":"question","counter":3530,"qnumday":620,"qnumall":"[49698\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300083#WRBB03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the hospitals and or healthcare centres in which Legionnaires disease occurred in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1075","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3531,"content":"<p>Since 2010 there have been three cases of patients having Legionella's Disease as a consequence of being a patient of a HSE healthcare facility.

A second registration board, the Radiographers Registration Board, was established on 16th December, 2011 and its register is expected to be established in the near future.  Three further registration boards, the Dietitians Registration Board, the Occupational Therapists Registration Board, and the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board have been established with effect from 1st November 2012.  It is also proposed to establish the Physiotherapists Registration Board either before the end of this year, or in early 2013.  All of the registration boards for the remaining designated professions should be established and their registers fully operational by 2015.  Under the provisions of the 2005 Act,  there is a two-year transitional period from the date on which the register of the members of that profession is established, during which existing practitioners may apply for registration. <\/p><p>  The Council which is an independent statutory body is responsible for setting the level of fees.  The e current fee structure is as follows: <\/p><p>A registration fee of  &euro;100 for new graduates, who have obtained recognised professional qualifications within two years of applying for registration;<\/p><p>An annual retention fee of &euro;295 for registrants, including those who paid the lower rate on graduation, is payable on the annual renewal date.<\/p><p>  Since the annual renewal fee of &euro;295 is subject to full tax relief it reduces to &euro;174 at the higher level of tax.<\/p><p>  All health regulators are self funding by way of annual fee income with operational costs being determined by the complexity and breadth of statutory functions specified in its legislation. e greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the HSCPC is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs. e twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 in the case of Clinical Biochemists to a high of 3,000 approximately for Medical Scientists and 5,550 for Social Care Workers, only amount to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions. is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The HSCPC is charged with extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, registration being only one, and the annual fee of &euro;295 being charged by the HSCPC is considered the minimum required to enable the Council to operate.  The fee charged by the HSCPC, which  is mindful of the requirement to become self funding by end 2015, is on a par with that charged by other health regulators and less than some in certain cases.  It is calculated approximately on the basis of the overall projected costs of the agency when fully operational divided by the total number of registrants and then further reduced to &euro;295 to take account of the Council's phased establishment.  The State is currently funding the HSCPC in its establishment phase (&euro;1.937 million in 2012) to offset the current shortfall in income from registration fees and will continue to do so on a reducing basis for the next 3 years.<\/p><p>  In response to concerns about the level of fee, the HSCPC has reviewed the regulatory structure to establish what scope exists for further reductions in registration fees and operational costs and has adopted the following measures:<\/p><p>Where an existing practitioner with the necessary experience and recognised professional qualifications, or equivalent, pays the registration fee of &euro;295 and is granted registration during the transitional period, also known as grandparenting,  the application fee will cover them for the remainder of the grandparenting period and one full year of retention of registration after expiration of grandparenting is concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;<\/p><p>The Council has requested the HSE to put in place arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;<\/p><p>Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost-effective operating system is will require the enactment of primary legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300085#WRDD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":3660,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300085#WRDD03550"},{"type":"question","counter":3661,"qnumday":670,"qnumall":"[50132\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111300085#WRDD03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the progress made on the implementation of the EU Directive 2010\/63\/EU on the use of animals for scientific and medical research purposes; and if he will confirm if the existing primary legislation here, which is in many aspects stronger than the provisions of the EU Directive, will be retained in the process of incorporating the Directive.","asker":"1110","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3662,"content":"<p>I do not accept that existing measures relating to the protection of animals used for scientific purposes set out in the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act as amended provide a higher level of protection to those set out in Directive 2010\/63\/EU.
