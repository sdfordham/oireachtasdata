An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na make full use of the extensive range of legislation which is in place to address street crime and anti-social behaviour, including knife crime and drug related crime.  In this regard there is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place with respect to knife crime including strong Garda powers to search without a warrant and penalties of up to five years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  Tackling this type of crime is central to the overall and ongoing implementation of the Dublin City Centre Policing Plan.  This involves a high-visibility uniformed presence on key thoroughfares, as well as the use of undercover Garda&iacute; as appropriate. As part of the Garda Plan a range of dedicated policing operations and measures are in place including Operation Spire and Operation Pier which target crime with concentrated high-visibility patrolling, as well as a special operation to enhance public order policing on the Liffey boardwalk. Drug crime is further targeted by covert operations such as Operation Viking and Operation Clean Streets.<\/p>  <p>  The resumption of Garda recruitment and the deployment of newly attested Garda&iacute; are of course key components in providing visible policing in the city centre and elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Garda responses, I am sure the Deputy would concur that the issues involved are not simply policing ones. He will also recall that I have previously met with the key state agencies and other stakeholders in relation to various actions which are aimed at improving the general environment in Dublin City Centre, and strongly support this ongoing work. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the concerns which have been expressed about drug misuse in the city centre, the Deputy will be aware that  the Government's overall response to the problem of drug misuse, is set out in the National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009-2016. The Strategy is being delivered under the stewardship of my colleague, Minister of State &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and it provides a coordinated and comprehensive response founded on a partnership approach and work is already underway in planning the development of the new Strategy post 2016.<\/p>  <p>  I think it is generally accepted that the complex issues which contribute to drug addiction and related behaviours must be addressed in a coordinated and cross-cutting manner.  In response to the particular issues arising in Dublin City Centre a multi-agency street outreach approach is being used to work with vulnerable and high-risk individuals and an offender management programme is being piloted to address repeat offending in the Dublin City area.  These measures, combined with the Government's initiatives to tackle homelessness, are helping to address the broader aspects of the problems referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Deputy will also be aware that I strongly support the continued close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council and other agencies as well as ongoing consultation with key stakeholders, such as the Dublin City Business Forum.  My Department is maintaining contact with these cooperative initiatives, and I understand that positive feedback is being received in relation to the policing measures being employed by the Garda authorities, and their level of engagement with business and community interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100060#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100060#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[42407\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100060#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the additional resources that will be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Gurranbraher and Mayfield in the Cork city Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na division under Operation Thor; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>Operation Thor is a multi-stranded national operation which builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide.

The Government Legislative Programme which was published on 22 September includes the Judicial Council Bill amongst those Bills which are expected to be published in the period from the commencement of the current Dail session to the start of the next session.  The Bill has been the subject of extensive consultation with the judiciary, and my Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to bring it to an early conclusion.  I remain committed to advancing this legislation within a speedy timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  As regards judicial appointments, a consultation process relating to the system of such appointments was conducted in 2014 with the intention of instituting reforms to enhance the current system. The need to ensure and protect the principle of judicial independence was a significant factor in initiating the consultation process.  Further, while the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process was a model of best practice in its day, almost 20 years from its establishment it was considered worthwhile to review the operation of the entire judicial appointments system to ensure it reflects current best practice, that it is open, transparent and accountable and that it promotes diversity.<\/p>  <p>  There was a significant response to the call for submissions and, arising from the consultation process, draft legislative provisions to reform and update judicial appointment procedures are being prepared by my Department.  The review, and reform of this area which is of critical importance to the functioning of our system of justice, provides an opportunity to determine how to best respond to the expectations and needs of a modern State.  I anticipate that legislation in the matter will be published in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100061#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100061#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[42419\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100061#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the additional resources that will be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in County Galway under Operation Thor; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>Operation Thor is a multi-stranded national operation which builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.<\/p><p>This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p><p>Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p><p>The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.<\/p><p>In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.

In fact, I have secured a doubling of the funding for these types of initiatives to be funded by my Department in 2016. My Department is currently considering how this funding might be best allocated, in consultation with the Garda authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100061#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":62,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100061#WRB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":63,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[42422\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100061#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations and the number of garda&iacute; in each station in County Westmeath, County Longford, County Roscommon and County Monaghan on 1 November 2010 and on 1 November 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":64,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel, among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

Implementation of this programme, including the reforms recommended by the Inspectorate, is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach.<\/p><p>Following the publication of the Report, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established an Implementation Steering Group to focus on the implementation of the short<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">, <\/font>medium and long-term recommendations in the Report.  To assist in the overall reform process a Strategic Transformation Office has been established at Garda Headquarters to coordinate the implementation of the reforms arising from the Inspectorate&rsquo;s report.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has taken a number of important steps to address the issues identified including the establishment of a new Data Quality Team within the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), and the piloting of a new incident recording process to test data review processes. Arising from and building on this work, the Commissioner indicated that further measures will be rolled out to enhance accountability, governance and oversight of investigations.<\/p><p>In light of the concerns raised by the Inspectorate about the recording of crime data, and the implications for the Official CSO Recorded Crime Statistics, the CSO conducted an in depth review of the crime figures and published its analysis of these matters on 30 June this year. The work of both the CSO and the Garda Inspectorate identified common issues of concern in relation to Garda crime recording processes and systems.  Many of these issues have no doubt built up over time and it is true to say that similar issues have also been found with police data in other jurisdictions.  CSO's analysis clarified and quantified the issues which were identified by the Inspectorate in relation to crime recording.  Notwithstanding these issues, the CSO concluded that the data are of sufficient quality to allow publication of crime statistics, on the basis that care should be taken in their interpretation in light of the report&rsquo;s analysis.

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.<\/p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.<\/p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100061#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Confidential Recipient","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100061#WRB03150"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[42388\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100061#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she believes that the present arrangements for investigations into Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whistleblowing allegations are sufficiently robust, given the current ongoing cases; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>It is assumed that the cases referred to are the same cases that were raised in Parliamentary Questions on 20 October and 26 May, 2015.

Notwithstanding the deliberations of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on this matter, I am committed to tackling the lengthy delays in the protection system.  A number of initiatives have already been taken to deal with the number of cases on hand, including the scheduling of interviews on Saturdays, the transfer of subsidiary protection application processing to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the establishment and subsequent enhancement of a legal panel to assist the Commissioner with this work, and the appointment of additional members to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. <\/p>  <p>  As I also mentioned in my response to the Deputy on 10 November last, one of the key recommendations in the Working Group Report is the early enactment of the International Protection Bill which will provide for the introduction of a single application procedure for international protection, which is specifically aimed at addressing the length of time persons spend in the protection process.  The Bill provides for the transfer of responsibility for the processing of protection applications from the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is intended to establish a Protection Office within the Department for this purpose.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of an independent International Protection Appeals Tribunal. The new procedure will significantly streamline and speed up the processing of protection applications and will reduce the length of time that persons spend in the Direct Provision system.  Existing best practice will be protected and embedded within the new regime.  The Deputy will be aware that I published the Bill last week with a view to have it enacted by year end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC00550"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[42418\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations and the number of garda&iacute; in each station in County Cavan and in County Monaghan on 1 November 2010 and on 1 November 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor.  This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.<\/p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.  This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles.  We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime.  These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources.  A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.  Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring. <\/p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.  I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment, will help disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety of all our communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Terrorism","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC01550"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[42436\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on the emergency meeting of EU Justice and Interior Ministers in Brussels in Belgium on 20 November 2015 which discussed the European Union&rsquo;s response to the terrorist attacks in Paris in France; the proposals the Irish Government made as being the most appropriate response to the tragic events there; and if she will make a statement on the matter. ","asker":"1003","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>On 20 November 2015, I met with EU Justice and Interior Ministers in emergency session in Brussels to discuss the European Union's response to the terrorist attacks, which took place in Paris on 13 November 2015.  As well as making clear Member States&rsquo; solidarity with France, the focus of Ministers&rsquo; was ensuring an appropriate and unified response to the attacks, including all reasonable measures to counteract the terrorism threat.  In this regard, the Council Conclusions of 20 November 2015 underline the importance of accelerating the implementation of all areas covered by the statement on counter-terrorism issued by the Members of the European Council on 12 February 2015 and in particular of the following measures: the EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) directive, firearms, controls of external borders, information sharing, terrorist financing, and the criminal justice response to terrorism and violent extremism. <\/p><p>At the meeting on 20 November, I expressed on behalf of Ireland my deepest sympathy to the French Government and to the people of France.  I offered Ireland&rsquo;s support for the Council Conclusions, and in particular the proposals put forward by France.<\/p><p>In referring to the critical importance of cooperation between the police and intelligence services in combatting terrorism, I expressed my view that enhanced access for EU police and security services to data and intelligence sharing has a critical role in the fight against terrorism.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already makes full use of the range of information sharing means available to them, including Interpol, Europol and especially bi-lateral information exchange.  I added that we must always be careful to ensure that any additional measures we consider enhance rather than complicate that existing co-operation.<\/p><p>In relation to the European Passenger Name Record Directive, the Council emphasised that the Directive should include internal EU flights in its scope, provide for a sufficiently long period during which the PNR data can be retained in non-masked-out form and that the Directive should not be limited only to crimes of a transnational nature. I confirmed that Ireland fully supports the compromise proposals put forward by the Presidency in relation to the Directive in the interests of securing early agreement with the European Parliament before the end of 2015.  I am satisfied that the Council&rsquo;s general approach on the PNR proposal, which was established in April 2012 and supported by Ireland, contains a robust set of bespoke safeguards for privacy and data protection in the context of a proportionate framework for providing law enforcement access to PNR data to support the fight against terrorism and serious crime.<\/p><p>In relation to other issues discussed, I indicated Ireland&rsquo;s support for the proposals relating to terrorist financing, given the fact that disrupting the flow of funds to terrorists is a vital aspect of combatting their activities.  I also confirmed that Ireland supports EU common standards for the deactivation of firearms and welcomed the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to develop an Action Plan against illegal trafficking of weapons.<\/p><p>  I acknowledged that the establishment in Europol of the Counter Terrorism Centre is an important development and that its role in removing illegal internet content will be particularly important in helping to stem the spread of material that contributes to radicalising people and feeding extremism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Accommodation Standards","counter":114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC01750"},{"type":"question","counter":115,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[42289\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the practice of doubling and trebling the number of prisoners in prison cells is draconian; if there should be one prison bed per prison cell, given that many prisoners in custody have mental health issues and problems with anger management and given that cell sharing is proving very problematic for prison staff and prisoners.","asker":"1005","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":116,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that figures in relation to the prisoner population and capacity levels are published on their website on a daily basis.

importance and the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Service (INIS) of my Department works closely with their UK counterparts across a number of areas to ensure that any abuses of the CTA are addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Over the course of the past year or so, there has been a marked increase in the number of asylum applications from Southern Asian nationalities. Checks carried out show a previous UK immigration history in respect of a substantial number of these applicants.  This year the number of applications for asylum is expected to reach over 3,300 compared to 1,448 last year.  A large portion of this increase can be attributed to persons with previous UK immigration histories.<\/p>  <p>  This matter has been raised at the highest levels between officials of the Department and the UK Home Office, specifically at meetings of the Common Travel Area Forum jointly chaired by the Acting Director of the INIS and his UK counterpart.  Arising from this meeting a joint operation to detect illegal immigrants has been undertaken by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and the UK Border Force to carry out checks at the ferry ports.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is enhanced cooperation with the respective agencies and with the UK to fast track some applications under the Dublin Regulation to return the persons concerned to the UK as quickly as possible.  A similar project is under way to fast track substantive asylum cases through to deportation stage and efforts are underway to enforce a number of Deportation Orders already processed where the applicants have been refused refugee status and leave to remain.<\/p>  <p>  The immigration service works closely with the UK authorities to monitor and address any immigration abuses between the two countries and share relevant information on an ongoing basis in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to compile the figures sought by the Deputy without expending a disproportionate amount of scarce resources.  However, I can say that immigration controls at ports of entry to the State remains a crucial element of enforcement and the numbers of refusals of leave to land this year are expected to be significantly up on last years figure of 2,615.  In that regard, it should be noted that in accordance with Section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004, one of the grounds that a person can be refused leave to land is if the person concerned intends to travel (whether immediately or not) to the UK and would not qualify for admission had they come directly to the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC02350"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[42417\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the additional resources that will be made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in County Cavan and County Monaghan under Operation Thor; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":125,"content":"<p>Operation Thor is a multi-stranded national operation which builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide.

These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p><p>I am confident that this comprehensive operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, supported by Government investment in Garda resources and personnel, will  disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve  the safety of all our communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Measures","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC03550"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[42377\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when legislation reducing bankruptcy terms from three years to one year will be introduced to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality reported to me earlier this year with recommendations in relation to bankruptcy matters, including the bankruptcy term. <\/p><p>I and my officials have now completed consideration of those recommendations and I expect to be in a position to announce further details in relation to this shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Terrorism","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC03750"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[42396\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her assessment of the threat of a terrorist attack taking place here, similar to the attack in Paris in France; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>As I have stated in the House, Ireland, just like other democratic states, cannot be considered to be immune from the threat posed by international terrorism and extremism.

","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":149,"content":"<p>The formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations is a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. <\/p>  <p>  The Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme was implemented in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during 2012 and 2013. The direct savings from the Programme as highlighted by the Deputy are modest.  However, it is important to recall that the primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  In its review of the Garda Station Network, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations, resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and  allows  front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.<\/p>  <p>  In tandem with the rationalisation of stations, efforts have been directed towards ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.  In renewing the Garda fleet to support front line Garda responses over 640 new vehicles are coming on stream since the start of 2015.  So far this year 370 new vehicles have come on stream including new specialised vehicles with a further 260 vehicles between now and the end of the year.  This investment will provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motor cycles for high visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing.  This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan.  The increased budget allocation for 2016 will also facilitate additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing.<\/p>  <p>  This substantial level of investment will be accompanied by the continued renewal of Garda personnel with 600 new Garda to be recruited next year on top of the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year.  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced the commencement of the 2016 recruitment campaign for new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It underscores the Government&rsquo;s commitment to seamless ongoing recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that the Service is renewed and has the capacity to provide effective policing services throughout the country.  The 600 new Garda&iacute; to be recruited next year will bring to 1,150 the total number of new recruits since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  So far 295 of these recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are on the ground in communities nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  The totality of this investment will ensure that Garda&iacute; have the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of highly-mobile criminal gangs and to disrupt crime, particularly burglaries, across our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC04125"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[42428\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100062#WRC04150","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations in the Kilkenny district division on 1 November 2010 and on 1 November 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures. <\/p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.

national operation which builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures. <\/p>  <p>  This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Thor entails a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.  The Commissioner has assured me that she will aim to maximise the use of these additional resources. A large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars. Targeting these prolific offenders is a priority, consequently the allocation of resources under Operation Thor will be intelligence led and based on analysis of crime patterns  by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aim is to deploy resources in advance of where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na anticipate crime might take place in order to prevent the crime occurring.<\/p>  <p>  In this context the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to detail the additional resources that will be made available to any one County under Operation Thor.  However the Commissioner will continually review the allocation of resources under the Operation, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities across the Garda Regions so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of these resources.

The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda Surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.

These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner, in consultation with her senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including the additional allocation of the &euro;5 million to support Operation Thor.

The FG &amp;amp; Labour Government has been in office 56 months and the D&aacute;il has sat for 576 days &ndash; an average of almost 124 days a year, an increase of 31 more sitting days per year. <\/p><p>The first phase of the D&aacute;il Reform Programme was introduced in the summer of 2011 and included:<\/p><p>-  An additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays, taken by the T&aacute;naiste<\/p><p>-  Topical Issues Debates to replace the outmoded Adjournment Debates, so as to give Deputies an opportunity to raise issues direct with Ministers from the relevant Department<\/p><p>-  Friday sittings to enable Deputies to play a fuller role in the legislative process by introducing their own Bills and having those Bills debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il<\/p><p>-  A mechanism for appeal to the Ceann Comhairle if a Deputy is unhappy with the reply received to a Parliamentary Question<\/p><p>-  A Pre-Legislative review system where by Ministers could provide the Heads of a Bill to the relevant Oireachtas Committee to review before the Bill was published<\/p><p>-  Restructuring of the Oireachtas Committee system by reducing the number of Oireachtas Committees from 25 to 16<\/p><p>-  Introducing a new Oireachtas Committee chaired by an Opposition Deputy to work with Ombudsmen's offices and review petitions. <\/p><p>In the summer of 2012, further reforms to the Oireachtas Committee system were introduced, which streamlined the structure and provided an additional focus on areas of priority such as Jobs and Agriculture.<\/p><p>In September 2013 the Government announced the second phase of D&aacute;il Reforms and the D&aacute;il debated and approved changes to Standing Orders in October 2013. These reforms are being phased in and include changes to enable more public involvement in the law-making process:<\/p><p>-  A Pre-Legislative Stage at an Oireachtas Committee is now a general requirement for non-emergency legislation.  A Minister who does not bring a Bill to Committee for Pre-Legislative Stage is required to explain that decision to the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>-  The new Pre-Legislative Stage allows for an unprecedented and extensive engagement by the public in law-making. The Committee can consult with experts and civic society groups; crucially, this takes place before the legislation is drafted.<\/p><p>-  Where there has been a Pre-Legislative Stage, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee has an opportunity to outline the Committee's work to the members of the D&aacute;il during the Second Stage debate after the Minister and main opposition spokespeople have spoken on the Bill.<\/p><p>In addition, each year the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will address the D&aacute;il setting out the Government&rsquo;s annual priorities, with Ministers setting out their Department&rsquo;s plans.<\/p><p>The role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget process has also been expanded.<\/p><p>There has been a reduction in the number of Legislative Programmes to two per year.<\/p><p>The time available for legislative debate in the D&aacute;il has been increased, by increasing the total number of sitting days, extending the length of sitting days and starting at 9.30 am on Wednesdays and Thursdays. <\/p><p>The way legislation is debated in the Chamber has been improved:<\/p><p>-  At First Stage, the proposer of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill now has five minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill to the D&aacute;il and explain the reasons for proposing it.<\/p><p>-  Where proposed legislation has been the subject of Pre-Legislative Scrutiny, at Second Stage the Chair or Vice Chair of the Committee which considered the Bill at Pre-Legislative Stage has a speaking slot, of the same length as that of the Minister and Opposition Spokespeople, to report to the D&aacute;il on the Committee's findings.<\/p><p>-  At the end of the Second Stage debate, 45 minutes may be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies, chosen by the Ceann Comhairle, who have previously spoken. <\/p><p>The number of Friday sittings has been expanded and the D&aacute;il now sits every second Friday to debate Private Members' Bills and Committee Reports selected using a lottery system. This has encouraged a rapid growth in the number of Bills introduced by Deputies, from 14 published in 2010 to 53 published in 2014.  The new Friday sittings also allow Committees, for the first time, to seek directly to have their own reports debated in the D&aacute;il. <\/p><p>The system of Topical Issues now requires the Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department to reply; if this is not the case, the Deputy who raised the issue can have it deferred until a Minister or Minister of State from that Department is available.<\/p><p>The time allocated to Oral Parliamentary Questions to Ministers has been standardised to 75 minutes. An ordinary Oral Question will be answered only if the Deputy tabling the Question is in the Chamber when it is reached, and the Deputy is given a brief period, of 30 seconds, to outline the question. <\/p><p>The Government also passed the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges &amp;amp; Procedures) Act 2013 and the Standing Orders to establish an Oireachtas Inquiry system are now in place. The Banking Inquiry is the first Oireachtas Inquiry established under this new legislation.<\/p><p>The Convention on the Constitution's 7th Report, on the issue of D&aacute;il Reform, is currently being considered and a response is expected on this over the next few months. <\/p><p>D&aacute;il Reform is an ongoing process and the Government intend to bring forward a further package of reforms for consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100063#WRD05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1098"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unemployment Data","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100063#WRD05300"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[42604\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100063#WRD05400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":" the number of persons under the age of 24 who were unemployed and on the live register, who were in employment, who were on activation schemes and who were in tertiary education, over the past 18 months, in tabular form.","asker":"959","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>The exact information requested by the Deputy is not available.<\/p><p>The Live Register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance and other registrants as registered with the Department of Social Protection. <\/p><p>The most recent Live Register figures available are for October 2015.<\/p><p>Table 1a below shows the number of persons under 25 years of age (24 years and under) on the Live Register for the months from May 2014 to October 2015.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the Live Register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, and seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance.<\/p><p>The most recent data on numbers on Live Register Activation Programmes are for September 2015.

The free travel scheme is available to all people aged over 66 living permanently in the State. Applicants who are under age 66, including those with learning disabilities, must be in receipt of a qualifying payment in order to qualify for the scheme. The qualifying payments for those aged under 66 are invalidity pension, blind pension, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance or an equivalent social security payment from a country covered by EC Regulations or one with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement. Free travel is provided for people in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance to facilitate their caring role and support their social inclusion. <\/p>  <p>  There is a provision for free travel passes for visually impaired children who satisfy the medical conditions for the blind pension. The provision is a long standing one based on supports for the blind, including the blind pension that predated other supports for the disabled. <\/p>  <p>  Children with other disabilities may qualify for the domiciliary care allowance. This is a monthly payment of &euro;309.50 for a child with a disability. The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs. On most transport services children under sixteen years of age are charged fares at special concessionary child rates.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the free travel scheme to persons who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Where the travel costs are non-recurring, the SWA scheme provides for exceptional needs payments to be made to assist with essential, once-off expenditure in exceptional circumstances. There is no automatic entitlement to such payments. Again, every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. The ENP scheme is not intended to cover circumstances where responsibility for the payment or the expenditure rests with another Government Department or Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100064#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Allowance Eligibility","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100064#WRE02400"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[42447\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100064#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a fuel allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":248,"content":"<p>The person concerned is a participant on a Community Employment (CE) Scheme.

Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseekers benefit. The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment over two years - 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2.

This policy objective prioritises scarce resources to those in receipt of qualifying welfare payments. Accordingly the employment services and schemes provided by the Department are focused in the first instance on this cohort of unemployed people.<\/p>  <p>  A person in respect of whom an adult dependent allowance is paid under another&rsquo;s Jobseeker Allowance payment is not required to be unemployed (i.e. available for and actively seeking employment). Such a person may however opt to apply for Jobseekers Allowance and become subject to the normal conditionality of the scheme. The Department facilitates such requests through a mechanism known as &lsquo;claim-splitting&rsquo; whereby the total amount due to a couple is divided into two separate claims. In such situations both members of a couple hold a claim in their own right and have access to the full range of activation supports in line with the normal criteria. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, in line with the commitment in Pathways to Work, a range of services are available to non-employed persons who are not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment. For example employment services, such as advice on job-search activities and the use of online job search tools, are available to people if they register with the Department&rsquo;s employment services offices, regardless of their social welfare status. <\/p>  <p>  Unemployed persons not in receipt of payments may be eligible to avail of upskilling opportunities, for example through ETB training for unemployed people (at present there are 1,009 upcoming day courses and 552 upcoming evening courses). Although not eligible to receive a training allowance while undertaking the course, they may receive some support for expenses on travel, meals and accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  An updated Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy is under development within the Department of Social Protection and it is intended to bring this strategy to Government for approval shortly. While the new strategy is still being formulated I expect that it will reflect labour market changes in our economy. In particular whereas the existing strategy was formulated during a period of very high unemployment and focussed on supporting people who are unemployed the new strategy is likely, given the reduction in unemployment and on-going growth in employment, to augment this focus by, in addition, seeking to support an increased level of labour market participation in order to ensure that economic growth can be sustained. The strategy will therefore focus on consolidating previous reforms and on continued prioritisation of key cohorts; as well as considering the expansion of activation services to other cohorts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100064#WRE05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Review","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100064#WRE05500"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[42581\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100064#WRE05600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"in relation to her Department's Estimates for 2008, if a sum of &euro;3.75 million was accrued under provision of a review of community employment schemes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>In July 2008 the Labour Court recommended that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for Community Employment (CE) scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors, and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S (LCR19293).

CESI is the UK&rsquo;s leading not-for-profit company dedicated to tackling disadvantage and promoting social inclusion in the labour market. Based on its knowledge of  how contracted employment services operate in other States CESI provided advice with regard to the design of the JobPath model including detailed financial modelling of a payment by results approach in Ireland.  CESI also assisted with the preparation and delivery of presentations at open consultation fora prior to and during  the procurement process for JobPath itself, with responding to queries from actual and potential tenderers during the procurement process and with the assessment of tenders, in particular the modelling of contract finances based on the prices and performance offers received from tenderers. Given the nature of the financial analysis I believe that publication of the CESI work would undermine the State&rsquo;s ability to secure best outcomes from the existing contracts or indeed from any contracts that might be placed in future years. Accordingly I do not plan to publish the analyses provided by CESI.<\/p><p>With regard to the procurement process for JobPath the Department issued a Prior Information Notice (PIN) on 1 July 2013 in which it advised the market that it was considering the potential of contracting third party providers of employment services. The Department held 2 information sessions on 26 July 2013 at which it outlined its thinking in relation to how JobPath might operate and invited attendees to provide feedback.  There were over 200 attendees at these sessions. On 7 November 2013 Enterprise Ireland hosted a capacity building and networking event for those interested in providing JobPath services. On 12 December 2013 the Department published a Request for Tenders (RFT). In conjunction with CESI the Department held a &ldquo;technical information session&rdquo; on 9 January 2014 at which a detailed explanation was provided to potential bidders on how to complete the &ldquo;JobPath Tenderer Bid Spreadsheet&rdquo; which was required to be submitted as part of a JobPath tender.  Over 50 attendees were present. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 28 February 2014. Contracts were awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender based on the following criteria (i) cost, (ii) implementation of services, (iii) delivery of services and (iv) contract management and governance. Full details of the JobPath procurement requirements and evaluation criteria used during the tender process are set out in the &ldquo;Request for Tenders for the Provision of Employment Services (JobPath)&rdquo;, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at .<\/p><p>The procurement process was conducted in accordance with Irish and EU procurement rules. The procurement process was overseen by a board that was chaired at Assistant Secretary level and included an independent external member who was formerly a commissioner of a regulatory body. The board was advised by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office as well as the National Development Finance Agency. The outcome of the process and the recommendation to award contracts were reviewed with D\/PER and the final decision to proceed to contract was made by Government. The successful companies were Turas Nua and Seetec.  As is the case with  CESI analyses it is not intended to publish the successful tenders as they contain commercially sensitive information and the bid process is confidential. In any event, to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.<\/p><p>Turas Nua is a new joint venture between FRS recruitment, based in Roscrea, and Working Links, a not for profit UK service provider.  It has been acknowledged by Working Links that some members of its staff incorrectly recorded employment and training placement for jobseekers under the 'New Deal', the precursor programme in the UK to the Work Programme. However the Department of Work and Pension (DWP) has publicly stated that the errors occurred in 2008 as a consequence of its heavy reliance on paper-based transactions and that it is satisfied that these cases were investigated thoroughly by Working Links (the amount involved represented less than 0.05% of the payments at the time) and that appropriate actions were taken, with the associated amounts being repaid. DWP has subsequently awarded additional contracts to Working Links.<\/p><p>Seetec was accused of fraudulent activity by former staff members in 2013. This alleged fraud related to claims that Seetec inflated employment outcomes for people with disabilities under the 'Work Choices' programme in the UK (referenced in the May 2014 article).  The DWP has publicly refuted these claims and advised the UK&rsquo;s Public Accounts Committee that it has investigated the claims and found no wrongdoing.  The Work Choice programme is designed for persons with disabilities - the clients selected for referral to JobPath do not include such clients.<\/p><p>It is important to note, that neither of the above companies has been sanctioned by the DWP for any fraudulent activity. The Department is however cognisant of experiences in other jurisdictions with regards to the provision of such services and these have influenced the design of JobPath.  The Department is satisfied, for example, that the potential for the inflation of outcomes will be controlled in Ireland through the use of data matching with Revenue Commencement of Employment records and the Department&rsquo;s own welfare payment systems.<\/p><p>Significant safeguards have been built into JobPath. These include a service guarantee to ensure that all participants receive a baseline level of service. Both companies will be subject to regular on-site inspections and audits (including examination of financial records) to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with contractual obligations and the Department will undertake customer surveys to determine the level of jobseeker satisfaction with the services provided by the JobPath provides. As payments are linked to sustained employment outcomes (jobs must provide work of at least 30 hours per week for a period of at least 13 weeks with a maximum of four outcome fees being paid in arrears over a 52 month period) providers are incentivised not just to find, but also to sustain, employment for clients.  As part of the bid process providers offered and committed to target employment placement rates and payment penalties can be applied if performance is less than the level committed. Payment penalties can also be applied if service quality, as assessed through Department audits or customer surveys, does not meet required standards. In addition payment rates are linked to employment levels in the economy with automatic discounts being applied if employment levels exceed defined levels set out in the RFT.  I am satisfied that these safeguards, that were not a feature of the Work Programme model in Great Britain, protect the State&rsquo;s interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100065#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100066#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[42777\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100066#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will examine an appeal under the carer's allowance scheme from a person (details supplied), given that all medical evidence has been submitted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 6 November 2015.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced, and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The USC, like the Income Levy before it, does not apply to social welfare payments, such as the contributory and non-contributory State pensions,\u00a0or payments of a similar nature.\u00a0 However occupational pensions, including occupational pensions of retired civil servants,\u00a0are liable to the USC if the payment is greater than the exemption threshold, which for 2015 is &euro;12,012.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by my Department in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available on my Department's website at <i>www.finance.gov.ie.<\/i>The issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of that review.\u00a0 Such individuals are (or were) liable to modified rate PRSI, which does not generate an entitlement to the State Pension.<\/p><p>The Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these individuals from the USC charge as it would be very costly and difficult to achieve, and it would involve all income earners with the equivalent income benefiting from the exemption.\u00a0 In addition, it would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income with few exceptions. <\/p><p>However, as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum. Budget 2015 provided for a further\u00a0increase in the\u00a0exemption threshold\u00a0to\u00a0&euro;12,012 and I announced in my recent Budget speech that this threshold will increase to &euro;13,000 per annum from 1 January 2016.

I would point out\u00a0that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and \/or USC in 2014, including pensioners, are seeing a reduction in their tax bill this year where incomes are equal. Budget 2016 is now continuing this process of reducing the tax burden on low and middle income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of USC announced to take effect from January 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100067#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100067#WRH01950"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[42813\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100067#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons with incomes above &euro;500,000 in the past tax year for which figures are available; the average effective tax rate that applied to this group; and the number of these persons who had an effective tax rate of less than 15%, 10%, 5%, 2%, and 1%, respectively.","asker":"1203","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[42814\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100067#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons with incomes of between &euro;250,00 and &euro;500,000 in the past tax year for which figures are available; the average tax rate that applied to this group; and the number of these persons who had an effective tax rate of less than 15%,10%, 5%, 2%, and 1%, respectively.","asker":"1203","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":427,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[42815\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100067#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons with incomes of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;250,000 in the past tax year for which figures are available; the average tax rate that applied to this group; and the number of these persons who had an effective tax rate of less than 15%,10%, 5%, 2%, and 1%, respectively.","asker":"1203","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[42816\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100067#WRH02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons with annual incomes above &euro;100,000 who paid no tax on their income in the past tax year.","asker":"1203","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 to 205, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Unfortunately,\u00a0having regard to the level of detail required, the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to provide the information sought within the time available.

These reports are available on the bank's website at the following links:<\/p><p>and\u00a0.  The report on switching examined how many borrowers could save by switching provider, the costs involved in switching, the numbers switching and initiatives that would benefit borrowers, including increased information and greater transparency on mortgage products. The report on\u00a0mortgage interest rate types looked at\u00a0the number of borrowers on different interest rate types,\u00a0the propensity of contracts to change rate type over time and the level of instalments for different mortgage contract types.\u00a0<\/p><p>These reports do not directly relate to the issues raised by the Deputy in his question.\u00a0 Nonetheless, as the Deputy will be aware, I have taken steps to ensure that the banks provide\u00a0options for mortgage holders to reduce their monthly repayments.\u00a0Last May, I requested a\u00a0report from the Central Bank on the topic which was subsequently published on my Department's website and on the Central Bank's website. This report was entitled 'Influences on Standard Variable Rate Pricing in Ireland' and is available here: . <\/p><p>This report found that the spread between official ECB rates and the standard variable rate is relatively high and that new lending rates are above average compared to European peers. However, they noted that the pricing of loans reflects three main factorscredit risk, competition and bank profitability. Credit Risk is influenced by the high level of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process of collateral recovery; Competition is weak and this is not unrelated to the credit risk as new entrants may be deterred from entering the Irish market; Bank profitability is constrained by legacy issues. Profitability is needed to build capital buffers and to meet increasing regulatory requirements. <\/p><p>It should also be noted that the interest rate charged by banks is determined taking into account a broad range of factors including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.<\/p><p>Last May I met with the six main mortgage lenders and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high.\u00a0The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.<\/p><p>In September I concluded a series of\u00a0follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that\u00a0the majority have put options in place to allow borrowers reduce their repayments. These options\u00a0range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan to value and reductions in fixed rates. <\/p><p>While it is a matter for each individual borrower to\u00a0decide what suits their circumstances, I encourage\u00a0both new and existing borrowers to see what is available to them in their circumstances or, for existing\u00a0customers, to\u00a0consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory. In this regard, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) website www.consumerhelp.ie is a valuable source of information on the rates charged by various financial institutions.<\/p><p>You may also be aware that on 12 November the Central Bank published a consultation paper on proposed increased protections for variable rate mortgage customers. This is called Consultation Paper CP98 and is available on their website. The suggested measures fall under three broad categories: <\/p><p>- Lenders would be required to publish a summary statement of the factors that impact on their variable rate and the criteria and procedures that apply to setting such rates; <\/p><p>- On an annual basis lenders would be required to notify variable borrowers of alternative mortgage options.\u00a0 They would also have to notify borrowers of these options when increasing SVR rates and provide borrowers with a link to the Competition and Consumer Protection (CCPC) website to assist borrowers who wish to switch; <\/p><p>- The Central Bank is consulting on increasing the notification period for variable rate increases (it is currently 30 days) and they are also consulting on a proposal to require the lender to state the reason for changing the rate. <\/p><p>The closing date for submissions to the public consultation is 12 February 2016.\u00a0 <\/p><p>This initiative should increase transparency around the factors which influence a banks' standard variable rate pricing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100067#WRH03100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Sales","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100067#WRH03150"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[43037\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100067#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on reports that online retailers of alcohol from outside of Ireland are offering lower prices, allegedly without paying the correct excise and value added tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that the importation of alcohol into the State is subject to tight regulation.

This will bring the application of USC into line with that of income tax.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments also ensure that those who are exempt from USC due to low income do not become liable to USC on\u00a0all of their income\u00a0solely as a consequence of the additional day in the calendar year being a payday.\u00a0 It similarly provides that those who benefit from the exemption from the higher rates of USC, including those over 70 and medical card holders whose income does not exceed &euro;60,000, will not inadvertently become liable\u00a0to higher\u00a0rates of USC as a consequence of the additional payday falling within the calendar year.<\/p>  <p>  These amendments will come into effect for the current year which means that individuals affected by this issue who are due to be paid on 31 December this year will benefit from the changes.

It is the combination of these factors rather than any one factor that has contributed to an increase in overpayments.<\/p><p>1.  Non-compliance with the standard\u00a0self-service processes that were introduced\u00a0as part of the roll out of shared services across the Civil Service.\u00a0 Employees are now responsible for notifying\u00a0their own absences and forwarding medical certificates in a timely manner, and managers are responsible for updating\u00a0the absence record and return to work notification process,\u00a0all through self-service. These features are standard self-service processes in many other public and private organisations, but were only introduced as self-service responsibilties into the Civil Service\u00a0for the first time in 2013. When\u00a0these responsibilities that are part of the standard process are not completed\u00a0in a timely fashion, this significantly increases the risk of overpayment.<\/p><p>2.  The issue of\u00a0non-compliance with procedures or missing medical certifications is\u00a0being addressed by management in each participating Public Service Body. My Department continues to engage with local HR Departments to assist them address the issue of non-compliance with the absence reporting process itself and to have a positive impact on their own Departmental overpayment balance. The data is showing a positive trend.<\/p><p>3.  The new Public Service Sick Leave Scheme (2014) whereby people are reaching the limits of paid sick leave quicker than they previously would have, has made\u00a0a very significant contribution to\u00a0reducing absenteeism across the Public Service. However, an unintended consequence of reduced access to paid sick leave has been an increase in the number of overpayments. This can also be seen in organisations that are not serviced by PeoplePoint.\u00a0A review of this circular is currently underway within my Department to evaluate and address any operational difficulties with it.<\/p><p>4.  Another key factor giving rise to overpayments is that the majority of staff are paid in advance as opposed to arrears. As a result there is an inherent overpayment built into the system when a sick leave limit is exceeded. Once an organisation becomes a customer of PeoplePoint, the responsibility for recouping any monies owed transfers to PeoplePoint, regardless of the cause or date of overpayment.\u00a0 A single civil service recoupment policy was developed by my Department in March of this year which sets out the standard procedure for recouping money from any staff member when an overpayment occurs.\u00a0\u00a0This policy addresses a number of issues including the principles underpinning the recoupment of overpayments; the recoupment process itself; non-standard arrangements and repayment options.<\/p><p>5.  When\u00a0PeoplePoint\u00a0began operating in 2013, a large number of new staff were hired into PeoplePoint.\u00a0 The length\u00a0of time required to upskill so many new staff contributed to some delays in processing leave and absence transactions in the past. This issue has been addressed through training and development and quality checks, and there is\u00a0close monitoring of key performance indicators against service levels targets and these are being met.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made on the issue through prioritisation and a highly collaborative effort across Accounting Officers, HR Departments and Payroll Centres. A robust communication plan is in place to educate and alert managers on the impact of failing to carry out their responsibilities in the absence process that causes overpayments. Monitoring and reporting on overpayments occurs on a monthly basis to the HR Shared Service Centre Programme Board and on a bi-monthly basis to the Shared Services Steering Board comprising Secretaries General.<\/p><p>In relation to data protection, a <b>Data Protection Policy for Shared Services<\/b>(March 2014) is in place for all shared service centres, and this includes PeoplePoint. Each operation has a fully trained Data Protection Compliance Officer (DPCO) in place. The DPCO is supported by the Operations Governance Manager in Corporate unit of the National Shared Services Office. Compliance officers are ready to respond to any breach of security swiftly and effectively. All staff in operations receive data protection training at induction, and refresher training on an annual basis.<\/p><p>The reporting of data breaches within operations is managed through the DPCO who gathers the data on the breach. Any breach is treated with the utmost seriousness. A breach is investigated, reported and assessed through a root cause analysis approach.

In tandem with this growth, there has also been considerable expansion within the broader consumer internet sector (including social media and mobile internet) to which a large part of the games industry is inextricably linked and with other related activities such as software development, financial services, online gambling, information security, animation &amp;amp; film production, and creative arts (music, art, literature).This is a broad sector that continues to evolve and faces considerable disruptive competitive forces globally &ndash; forces that are shifting the nature of the activities, channels to market, players and competitors &ndash; although there are more recent indications of greater stability in the market. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, Ireland continues to attract foreign investment in the wider sector and continues to have a hotbed of very early stage start-ups and independent games designers, with new entrants every year. The Irish owned element of the Irish games cluster is still relatively young by international standards but its reputation is growing and awareness within the investor community to the attractiveness of the Irish games sector is increasing. A number of Irish games startups (in middleware and content) have raised seed and follow on series &lsquo;A&rsquo; funding investments over the last 24 months. Current exports from the Irish owned segment account for over 95 percent of their turnover and are oriented towards the UK and North American markets in the main. <\/p>  <p>  In response to PQ 318 of 29 September (two months ago), I highlighted the fact that many of the actions set out in the Forf&aacute;s report (2011) have been delivered upon since I established the Games Cluster Development Team in 2012. For example: <\/p>  <p>  -  a pilot &ldquo;hothouse&rdquo; initiative for undergraduate and Post-Leaving Certificate courses was devised and run in late 2013, which saw students from games, animation and multimedia courses working in multi-disciplinary teams on projects supported by an industry mentor;  <\/p>  <p>  -  a leading games expert visited Ireland for six weeks in September and October 2014 as part of a Fulbright U.S. Specialist Award in conjunction with the HEA and carried out master classes and curriculum reviews of Digital Games courses at a number of Irish universities and colleges; <\/p>  <p>  -  EI&rsquo;s Competitive Start Fund (&euro;50k equity) has had a significant impact on the early stage indigenous games sector since December 2010. Over this period, EI has funded over 20 Games companies to date. The cohort has also availed of a number of start-up management development programmes; <\/p>  <p>  -  IDA Ireland sees indications of a stronger pipeline for production activities in the closely related animation sector post the enhancement of section 481.  <\/p>  <p>  - CEOs are collaborating in a structured way to grow the cluster to the next stage of international growth through industry representative groups such as Games Ireland. Indigenous indie developers have recently set up a new representative body called &lsquo;Imirt&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  As with other companies in the technology and creative sectors, games companies can avail of the range of direct supports provided by the enterprise agencies such as the Seed Capital fund, In-market and Management development, R&amp;D funding and tailored company expansion packages. A range of financial instruments also exists to assist companies which are not sector specific. <\/p>  <p>  The enterprise development agencies have worked to heighten awareness within the sector of the existing R&amp;D supports available to the Games sector. They held a number of R&amp;D supports workshops and issued an enterprise friendly guide on R&amp;D tax credits which included examples of relevance to games companies. <\/p>  <p>  Games companies that can avail of existing R&amp;D supports and R&amp;D tax credits may be in a position to avail of the recently announced Knowledge Development Box (KDB) which will be provided for in the Finance Bill. There will also be a mechanism put in place to facilitate small and medium sized enterprises with income of less than &euro;7.5 million arising from IP and group turnover of &euro;50 million which will be introduced during 2016.  The Capital Gains Tax Entrepreneur Relief  introduced in Budget 2016 will also be available to those operating in the games sector (subject to certain criteria) as will the Earned Credit Income credit for self-employed and the extended 3 year corporation tax relief for start-up companies. Other non-sector specific longstanding tax related investment incentives include the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) and Start up Refunds for Entrepreneurs (SURE).<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for business investment across a range of sectors involves range of factors that can influence location decisions. For example, the talent base associated with, and relevant to, the games sector is a significant attractiveness factor. Ireland also possesses a long history and tradition in technical and creative content development, through our innate storytelling abilities seen through the success of our animation industry to the international recognition of Ireland today as a centre of excellence for technology investment. Investment in Ireland&rsquo;s broadband\/internet infrastructures also has had a strong role to play in underpinning new activity in the games sector in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  We have recently launched Enterprise Policy 2025 which sets out the ambition to have 2.18 million people in employment by 2020. The strategy spans a range of sectors including the ICT and creative sectors, of which the games industry is a part. Through the enterprise development agencies, and together with the industry, and we will work to ensure the employment growth potential of this dynamic sector is realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100068#WRJ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":515,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100068#WRJ05900"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[42757\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100068#WRJ06000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the amount spent on lease private security, pest control and other services relating to the maintenance of Carrisbrook House at 122 Northumberland Road in Dublin D04 A295, a development which originally obtained planning permission around the time of the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising to replace a Victorian house and adjoining terrace that played a part in the Rising; if current and projected future expenditure in respect of Carrisbrook House represent value for money for the taxpayer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":517,"content":"<p>The lease on Carrisbrook House has been held by IDA Ireland since September 2013 following the completion of the assignment of properties from Forf&aacute;s to IDA Ireland.

It is a set of rules for managing EU fishing fleets and for conserving stocks. The CFP operates within the international framework of the Law of the Sea.<\/p>  <p>  Control of the vessel within Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Fisheries Zone is a matter for the Irish control authorities who monitor fishing activity of all vessels operating the area.  The Control authorities have on-going information in relation to the vessels operating in the Irish Exclusive Fisheries zone including their activities and characteristics.  Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature concerning sea fisheries control are, as a matter of law, exclusively for the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and the Naval Service. As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational matters including in relation to law enforcement.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the overall framework for fisheries control in the EU, in October 2009 a new regulation dealing with fisheries controls was adopted. Council Regulation 1224\/2009 establishes a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Control and inspection is now focused where it is most effective through an approach based on systematic risk analysis. Inspection procedures are standardised and harmonised for all stages in the market chain, including transport and marketing.  The Control Regulations were introduced so that there is a common EU level playing field and to provide for an effective range of controls across EU waters.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key elements of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy is the introduction of a phased ban on the discarding of unwanted fish catches. The first part of the landing obligation, the ban on discarding pelagic stocks such as herring and mackerel, came into effect on the 1 of January 2015. The EU Commission adopted a Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1393\/2014 on 20 October 2014 which implements a discard plan for certain pelagic fisheries in north-western waters in line with the recommendation of the North West Waters Member States Group.<\/p>  <p>  A Control Experts Group from the North West Waters Regional Group of Member States has been set up and has produced a draft set of recommendations on additional control measures for the pelagic sector in respect of the landing obligation in pelagic fisheries. The views of the Pelagic Advisory Council in accordance with article 18 of the CFP basic regulation (EU No 1380\/2013) on the recommendations have been received and will be fully considered.<\/p>  <p>  The draft recommendations are being considered by the NWW Member States Group. The measures recommended by the Control experts cover a range of actions including the use of cameras or other remote sensing equipment on all large pelagic vessels, both freezer vessels and our own RSW (Refrigerated Seawater Tank vessels) to support the landing obligation. It also recommends control observers &ldquo;for individual trips to address dynamically - assessed risks of a more transient nature.&rdquo; It is important to note that the flag Member State would be responsible for placing control observers on its vessels and funding is a matter for each Member State. I consider that any strengthened control measures must provide tools to both the flag Member State and the coastal Member State to better monitor and control fishing activities. We will continue to work closely with the North Western Waters Member States to identify the control actions that are most useful so that the landing obligation is fully respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100070#WRL03600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishery Harbour Centres","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100070#WRL03650"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[42661\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100070#WRL03700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will report on the urgent need for dredging Howth Harbour in County Dublin; when dredging will commence; the estimated cost of the regular dredging and upkeep of the harbour; if dredging of the harbour is included in the 2016 capital Estimates or in the 2016 to 2018 capital envelope; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":641,"content":"<p>Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is one of the six designated Fishery Harbour Centres which are owned, managed and maintained by my Department under Statute.<\/p>  <p>  While first and foremost a working fishery harbour, Howth, similar to the other five Fishery Harbour Centres, has its own unique features and is home to a broad range of diverse economic and social activities.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to advise the Deputy that, notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, in excess of &euro;4.2 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth FHC as part of my Department&rsquo;s Fishery Harbour and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme from 2011 to 2014.<\/p>  <p>  For 2015, I approved funding of &euro;1.79 million for the maintenance and development of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.

The Justice and Home Affairs Council held an emergency meeting in the week following the appalling attacks in Paris on 13 November and Ministers were at one in seeking an appropriate and unified response to those attacks, including all reasonable measures to counteract the terrorism threat.  In this regard, the Council Conclusions of 20 November 2015, agreed by all the Member States, underline the importance of accelerating the implementation of all areas covered by the statement on counter-terrorism issued by the Members of the European Council on 12 February 2015 and, in particular, of the following measures: the EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) directive, firearms, controls of external borders, information-sharing, terrorist financing and the criminal justice response to terrorism and violent extremism.<\/p>  <p>  In referring to the critical importance of co-operation between the police and intelligence services in combating terrorism, I expressed my view that enhanced access for EU police and security services to data and intelligence-sharing has a critical role in the fight against terrorism.

It is fortunate that in Ireland there appears to be little tolerance for the open expression of extremist views directed against individuals and minority groups.  It is recognised that certain media, and in particular, social media, do provide a platform for the expression of views which can sometimes be characterised as intemperate or immoderate at best and at times, verging on the openly racist.  However, this is a phenomenon that is certainly not limited to the area of concern raised by the Deputy.  <\/p>  <p>  It is widely recognised that it is very difficult to combat or address such viewpoints without engaging civil society in a broader discourse centred around the values of pluralism, civility and tolerance; qualities which in my view find abundant expression in our civil and political discourse.  Unfortunately, there are those in every society who use tragedies such as the Paris attacks to denigrate those who are perceived as &ldquo;different&rdquo; or in some way perceived as &ldquo;separate&rdquo;. Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of people in our society actively oppose the expression of such extremist viewpoints.  In addition, it is a feature of Irish political life that no political party espouses extreme right-wing views on immigrants which I take to indicate that there is little support amongst the public for such extreme opinions. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the recent Government decision establishing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, the Government asked for a Communications Strategy and Implementation Plan to be developed, bearing in mind the issues which might arise during the course of the Programme&rsquo;s implementation.  This matter will be considered at the next meeting of the Taskforce which the Government established to oversee the Programme.

Accordingly, where a young person under the age of 18 comes into conflict with the law, the principles of the Act apply.  <\/p>  <p>  A key principle in the Children Act relating to young offenders is that detention should be a last resort.  In support of this principle, the legislation facilitates the incremental application of a series of measures, ranging from diversion in the first instance through community based sanctions, to detention.<\/p>  <p>  The first main filter in the youth justice system is the Garda Diversion Programme, involving at different stages and depending on the seriousness of the offence, the informal caution (without supervision) and the formal caution (with supervision), including possible involvement with a Garda Youth Diversion Project (GYDP).  <\/p>  <p>  The second main filter is the range of non-custodial sanctions available to the courts including court orders for dismissal; conditional discharge; the payment of fines or costs; compensation and the binding over of parents, and orders imposing a community sanction involving a suite of Probation Service supervised sanctions. In supervising community sanctions, the Probation Service utilises a number of community based organisations with dedicated resources to work with young offenders.  <\/p>  <p>  Finally and as a last resort, detention may be used.  <\/p>  <p>  The operation of the above statutory framework is substantially supported by the significant investment by my Department in community based programmes which are directed at diverting young people from further involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour.

It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  Further to this meeting, the Deaf Community prepared a report to reflect their views on key actions and priorities. The intention is that the recommendations from this report will be reflected in the new National Disability Inclusion Strategy, through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines as appropriate.  Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Inclusion Strategy's monitoring process.

Under the provisions of the EU relocation programme, persons considered for relocation who will be accommodated in EROCs upon arrival, must be from countries with a recognition rate for asylum of at least 75%.  Accordingly, the expectation is that a large proportion of relocated persons will qualify for refugee status within a very short time and will leave the EROCs.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed under the Programme to take in additional resettlement refugees who must also be temporally accommodated in EROCs for the purposes of reception, orientation and integration training, prior to being resettled in communities across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department, responsible for implementing the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP), were tasked with the sourcing of suitable accommodation and orientation services for the proposed network of EROCs. This involves an assessment of information regarding available State properties provided by the Office of Public Works and a request for expressions of interest from commercial accommodation providers.  The commercial expressions of interest are being evaluated alongside the information provided by OPW in respect of State properties.  This process remains ongoing and it would not be appropriate for reasons of confidentiality and commercial sensitivity to identify the sites being considered or examined. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, independent of the commitments under the above Government Decision, the numbers of persons applying for protection in the State has already significantly increased this year and this has placed great pressure on available accommodation.  There is now a need to provide temporary accommodation for the new cohort of asylum seekers and programme refugees who are due to arrive in the State over the next two years under the IRPP.  Ireland has always ensured that persons who applied for international protection were never left without bed and board by virtue of an inability to provide for themselves.  If Ireland is to maintain this honourable practice then the State must be in a position to enter into contracts to give effect to its commitments and to avoid a situation where those seeking international protection and who cannot provide for themselves  are effectively rendered homeless. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to stress that under the IRPP the accommodation being sought for persons is for the limited period of time sufficient to determine their application for asylum and necessary orientation following the attainment of refugee status or in the case of resettlement refugees to allow for a period of orientation prior to resettlement.  A sub-group of the Taskforce established by the Government to oversee the implementation of the Programme is considering how persons temporarily accommodated in EROCs are to be moved from EROCs and housed in communities across Ireland. I am informed that this sub-group is expected to report to the Taskforce in the near future. This aspect of the work of the Taskforce is being led by the Department of the Environment, Community  and Local Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100073#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":803,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100073#WRO02600"},{"type":"question","counter":804,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[42780\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100073#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will examine an application for temporary and limited leave to remain in the State by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry given that all requested documents have been submitted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":805,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that correspondence is due to issue shortly in this case.<\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the Status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been established for this purpose.

This includes personnel, Garda vehicles and the various technologies utilised to support front-line Garda&iacute; and intelligence-led operations against organised crime.  This process takes account of annual policing priorities determined by me as Minister for Justice in consultation with the Garda Commissioner as provided for under section 20 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.  <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are continually looking to ensure that the latest information, communications and forensic technologies are sourced and deployed to achieve their strategic objectives as set out in the context of their annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the 2005 Act.  This policy is designed to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be properly resourced to meet the evolving needs of a modern effective police force and take advantage of proven up to date technological developments in crime detection and prevention as they occur.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, it is also the case that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, in its reports on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, benchmarks the performance of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with best international policing practice.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of existing technology, the Deputy will be aware that a considerable amount of new Garda ICT solutions has been delivered over the past number of years.  These include the deployment of a secure national digital radio system (NDRS), the deployment and support of Garda and Community CCTV systems, an automated number plate recognition (ANPR) system, and the addition of many new functions to the PULSE system, which itself is further supported by a dedicated Garda data entry service in Castlebar.  The substantial additional investment of &euro;205 million in new technology and systems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 will facilitate progress on further important reforms arising from the Garda Inspectorate's report on Crime Investigation. Examples of the new systems to be developed through this investment include:<\/p>  <p> - new computer-aided dispatch to ensure responsive and coordinated deployment of Garda&iacute; in the community;<\/p>  <p> - mobile technology to give the Garda&iacute; secure mobile access to critical information when and where they need it;<\/p>  <p> - investigations management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations; and<\/p>  <p> - upgrading the ANPR to  enhance policing of road safety and compliance.<\/p>  <p>  The 2016 Budget allocation of &euro;1.5 billion for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes over &euro;67 million in additional funding which will allow the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 Garda&iacute; recruited since this Government reopened the Garda College in September 2014. It will also provide additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted, intelligence-led policing. This additional recruitment and budget allocation builds on the current high level of investment in Garda vehicles. We have invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles, as well as investment in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p>  <p>  In the area of forensics, the Garda authorities currently employ state-of-the-art automated fingerprint and ballistics identification systems which I am informed are at least on a par with those used by police forces in other EU jurisdictions.  The Deputy will also be aware of the recent launch of the national DNA database which has capacity to revolutionise the investigation of crime in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  These and other new technological solutions, as well as the investment in resources, will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective policing services in respond to the evolving challenges of modern day criminal activity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100073#WRO05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":830,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100073#WRO05300"},{"type":"question","counter":831,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[42909\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100073#WRO05400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is satisfied with the strength of the emergency response unit, with particular reference to the need to meet the threat of urban crime and acts of terrorism; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":832,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel, among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts.

A new Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill is currently being drafted which will update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board thus consolidating responsibility for legal aid schemes with the Board.<\/p><p>Civil legal aid is provided by the Legal Aid Board which is independent in the exercise of its functions, in accordance with Section 3 (3) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1994.  <\/p><p>However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made of the Board and I have been advised that the Board has carried out a number of initiatives to improve the service it delivers:<\/p><p>- The Board continues to make effective use of private practitioners in District Court cases to help reduce the number of clients waiting for legal services.  The use of private practitioners is designed to improve access to legal aid services in situations where a law centre is not in a position to provide a timely service. 5,194 cases were referred to the District Court Private Practitioner Scheme in 2014, a decrease of 8% on the 2013 figure of 5,640.<\/p><p>- The &quot;triage&quot; system of providing early advice to clients was implemented in 2012 as a means of responding to the increased demand.  The objective of this approach is to ensure that every applicant gets an advice appointment with a solicitor on a timely basis.  An evaluation of the triage approach took place in 2014 and determined that it was effective and it is now in place in all law centres.<\/p><p>- Since the Family Mediation Service came within the remit of the Legal Aid Board in November 2011 a very strong emphasis has been placed on reducing waiting lists nationally to ensure that the service complements that of the Board&rsquo;s law centres and that people who wish to try and resolve matters through mediation are not waiting longer than three months for an appointment with a mediator. The total number of cases dealt with by the mediation service in 2014 was 2,262 which was 6% higher than the number of cases (2,131) dealt with in 2013.  There were 888 agreements reached which is 15% higher than the 2013 figure of 769.<\/p><p>- The Dolphin House initiative which is a court related mediation initiative has achieved more that 1,200 agreements since its commencement and has been established on a permanent basis.The Board has also extended this service model to Naas and Cork and, more recently, Tipperary and Limerick in co-operation with the Courts Service.<\/p><p>- The piloting of mandatory information sessions about ADR\/mediation as a pre-requisite to getting a legal aid certificate to go to court in family law disputes involving children commenced in Cork in July 2014, Athlone in October and Castlebar in January 2015.<\/p><p>- The approach to be adopted in the delivery of legal services in the Coroners Court was agreed by the Board and my Department in November 2014.  The Board will grant legal aid certificates and has responsibility for the operation of the Private Practitioner Scheme whilst my Department will provide administrative assistance.<\/p><p>- The Refugee Documentation Centre provides an independent and confidential query and research service for Country of Origin Information to all agencies in the asylum process.  It processed 1,394  queries in 2014.  It also manages the Board&rsquo;s library and information service.<\/p><p>- The Board continues in its efforts to reduce non-pay and non-legal costs in order to free up more resources for service delivery. <\/p><p>The table shows the numbers waiting for Civil Legal Aid for the last five years. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2010<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Number waiting<\/td><td>3,412<\/td><td>5,067<\/td><td>5,014<\/td><td>4,443<\/td><td>3,153<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the number of persons waiting for Civil Legal Aid at 1 October 2015 had dropped to 2,684 and I am assured that the Board keeps the delivery of its services under constant review with a view to getting legal services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100074#WRP02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Resources","counter":867,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100074#WRP02700"},{"type":"question","counter":868,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[42931\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100074#WRP02800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position regarding the taking away of resources from the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Drogheda in County Louth, as stated by the local Garda superintendent (details supplied), and the urgent need to reverse this decision immediately in order to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the extra resources it requires, particularly the need to have more foot patrols in the town and in its environs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":869,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel, among the Garda Regions, Divisions, and Districts. <\/p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Gardai assigned to County Louth Garda Division on the 31 October 2015, the latest dates for which figures are readily available are 281 of which 104 are assigned to the Drogheda Garda District.

A crucial element of the Government's strategy is ongoing seamless recruitment to renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>With this in mind Budget 2016 made provision for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. On attestation, new probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are assigned to mainstream uniform policing duties. I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and that 10 of these newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to Co Louth Garda Division, 5 each to Dundalk and Drogheda Garda Stations.<\/p><p>I was very pleased to announce the commencement of the recruitment campaign for 2016 last Friday, 27 November. It is being organised by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Garda Commissioner. Applications must be made through .  The closing date for applications is Tuesday 5 January 2016.  Successful candidates can expect to enter the Garda College from June 2016 onwards. <\/p><p>In relation to the crime of burglary, Operation Thor is a multi-strand, national operation which builds on previous and current Garda operations to tackle crime, particularly burglaries, the number of which, as we know, increase with the advent of the long winter nights, in both urban and rural communities nationwide.  In excess of &euro;5 million is being committed to support Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support abroad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These activities include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.<\/p><p>This special, targeted operation has to be seen in the context of the major investment that this Government is making in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  The Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for a further &euro;46 million of investment in vehicles as well as an additional &euro;200 million for Information and Communications Technology which will allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. We are also investing in airborne surveillance.  Taken together, this step-change in investment in policing will ensure that the Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100074#WRP02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Prevention","counter":870,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100074#WRP03000"},{"type":"question","counter":871,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[43034\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100074#WRP03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will consider the use of security cameras for strategic locations in rural communities that are must-pass areas for criminals targeting isolated areas in locations (details supplied), meaning a handful of cameras could provide added security to thousands of persons; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":872,"content":"<p>Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005 lays down the conditions governing the operation of CCTV schemes in public areas.

However, in recognition of the link between staff qualifications and the quality of early years services, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme, which is provided in nearly all of the early  years services in this country provides a higher rate of capitation to services that employ staff who hold a higher level of qualification.  There are in the region of 4,300 early years services participating in the ECCE programme and more than 1,400 of these services were in receipt of the higher capitation  in the 2014\/2015 programme year. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that, in Budget 2016, the Government committed a further &euro;85 million to the early years sector in 2016. This additional funding, which will support the expansion of a number of childcare programmes implemented by my Department, has also enabled me to restore the capitation payments provided under the ECCE programme to pre-2012 levels from September 2016. This means that the higher rate of capitation provided to services will be increased from &euro;73 to &euro;75 per child per week with standard rate of capitation increasing from &euro;62.50 to &euro;64.50 per child per week.  <\/p>  <p>  The expansion of the childcare programmes in 2016 and the increased capitation levels will help providers to address some of the cost issues that impact on their services including remuneration costs. It will also provide support to services employing staff with Level 7 or higher qualifications and will provide a further incentive to other services to employ more qualified staff. <\/p>  <p>  New qualification requirements for staff working directly with children in early years services will be introduced in 2016 under the Early Years Quality Agenda.  All staff will be required to have a minimum Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in early years care and education, or an equivalent . In addition, pre-school leaders delivering the ECCE Programme, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will be required to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent. To support staff to meet these new qualification requirements, my Department established the Learner Fund which has already allocated &euro;3.5 million to over 3,000 staff for the purpose of up-skilling.<\/p>  <p>  Further funding to improve  the qualifications of the early years sector was secured as part of Budget 2016. This includes:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;1.5 million, which will be directed towards a Learner Fund in 2016. I will announce details of this Learner Fund shortly.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;1.5 million, which will fund the delivery of a 'Higher Education Programme for Inclusion Co-ordinators in Early Years Settings' as part of the model of supports I recently announced to ensure children with a disability can access and meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme.

During 2016, work will also commence on developing a new simplified childcare subsidy programme. This programme, which will replace the existing CCS and TEC programmes, will be available through both private and community\/not-for-profit providers in 2017.<\/p><p>- In 2012, capital funding of &euro;6m was provided to fund a maintenance programme for services (i.e. to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work and to purchase equipment).

Both Groups consulted widely with a range of stakeholders, including the early years sector, during the course of their work. <\/p>  <p>  Under this extended Programme, there will be three opportunities for eligible children to enrol during the pre-school year: children who reach the age of 3 between April and August will have the opportunity to enrol in September; children who reach the age of 3 between September and December will have the opportunity to enrol in January; and children who reach the age of 3 between January and March will have the opportunity to enrol in April. As a result of this extension, the number of children benefiting from the Programme is expected to rise from around 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year. For the 2016\/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, 22,000 from January 2017 and 15,500 from April 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In order to provide the early years sector with the time to build capacity to meet this increased demand, a decision was taken to introduce this new measure from September 2016. As the increased demand for the Programme is not expected to peak until January and April 2017, this timeframe should allow pre-school providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is already additional capacity in the early years sector to cope with some of the increased demand. Indeed, the Annual Survey of Early Years Services, which was conducted in December 2014, estimates that there are more than 24,000 vacancies in early years services across the country with almost 13,000 of these vacancies in sessional services. I am also aware that every year a significant number of new pre-school providers apply to participate in this Programme, and, this increased demand for, and additional investment in, free pre-school provision should encourage a greater numbers of applicants. <\/p>  <p>  The restoration of capitation rates to pre-2012 levels from September 2016 should also encourage a greater number of new applicants and encourage existing pre-school providers to expand.<\/p>  <p>  I am clear that more capacity will be required and that building this capacity may pose a challenge for some pre-school providers. Officials in my Department are committed to assisting with these challenges. They are already working closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations on a range of measures, which will assist pre-school providers meet increased demand for free pre-school provision, particularly from January and April 2017. Further information on these measures will be available shortly.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to payment for sick time for children availing of the ECCE Programme, the Programme contains provision for payment to continue in instances where the child is absent for periods of 4 consecutive weeks or less. It is only in instances where a child is absent for a period of more than 4 consecutive weeks  that the pre-school provider is obliged to cease claiming payment. If the child subsequently returns to the service, payment will be re-instated.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to payment for holiday time, pre-school providers voluntarily contract into the ECCE Programme on the basis of the capitation rates and number of payment weeks provided for under the Programme. It is a matter for pre-school providers themselves to decide whether the terms of the Programme are suitable for their service and whether they operate for the 38 weeks of the ECCE programme only.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100075#WRQ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":938,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100075#WRQ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":939,"qnumday":380,"qnumall":"[43030\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100075#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"to revert to this Deputy on (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":940,"content":"<p>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy's previous question, the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP), which was introduced by my Department and launched in September 2014, provides for childcare providers to submit applications for childcare funding through an online facility.  <\/p><p>For the purposes of further clarification, when a parent decides to register a child for participation in a childcare programme, the childcare provider in question gives the parent a Child Registration Form to fill out.

The purpose of ABF is to change the model of funding from the existing block grant budget system to a new approach where hospitals are paid based on the quantity and quality of the services they deliver to patients. Hospitals will be incentivised to pursue the most cost-effective means of achieving their performance targets and will also be subject to overall budgetary ceilings.  <\/p><p>Implementation of ABF is a multi-year project and extensive preparatory work has been undertaken over the last 24 months.  This work has allowed 2016 to be identified as the &ldquo;conversion year&rdquo; for inpatient and day case activity. This means that hospital budgets will be separated into ABF and non-ABF budgets for the first time.  Hospital funding associated with inpatient and day case activity will effectively be withdrawn from hospitals and replaced with funding provided upon the delivery of activity in line with agreed targets.  In order to maintain financial stability in the system, where appropriate, hospitals will be given transition adjustment payments to reflect the difference between their current costs and the national average cost.  These transition payments will be phased out over time. All non-ABF activity will remain block funded during 2016.  The ABF model will continue to evolve in subsequent years to encompass other aspects of hospital services, such as outpatient activity, before extending into community services.<\/p><p>It is important to note that ABF does not seek to reduce budgets.  Instead, it will encourage hospitals to use the resources at their disposal more efficiently and will provide a more transparent funding mechanism that more fairly rewards hospitals for the activity they undertake.<\/p><p>The Government published details on this major element of its programme of health service reform in the &quot;<i>Money Follows the Patient Policy Paper on Hospital Financing<\/i>&quot;.  In addition, the HSE has in  recent months published the &ldquo;<i>Activity Based Funding Programme Implementation Plan 2015 &ndash; 2017<\/i>&rdquo; which outlines the timetable for implementation over the next two years.

These measures in total have more than doubled capacity for this surgery for patients on the Crumlin waiting list in 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Additional consultant orthopaedic surgeons have also been appointed at Galway University Hospital to support the spinal service there.

Regional co-ordinators have been appointed by the HSE to assist individuals to provide advice, information and access to local services.<\/p>  <p>  On the education side, the National Educational Psychological Services engaged with all of the schools being attended by children with narcolepsy to provide guidance and assistance on the condition and the supports available.  These include special education home tuition, the provision of supplemental learning support\/resource teaching support on a needs basis and the provision of Special Needs Assistants support if required.  Furthermore, reasonable accommodations, including special examination centres and rest breaks were provided for students who sat state exams in June.  Similar arrangements will be available on a needs basis to students sitting state exams in future years.  The Department of Education and Skills issued circulars providing information to schools on the nature, likely symptoms, possible effect of the condition of narcolepsy on students and the supports available for students.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to third level, students diagnosed with narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination can access the Disability Access Route to Education scheme, which is a college\/university scheme which offers enhanced access routes to third level education.<\/p>  <p>  All health and educational services and supports will continue to be provided on an ex-gratia basis.

Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand, inter alia, the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings as part of the rollout of the new inclusive preschools model. <\/p><p>It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.<\/p><p>Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has raised.

The General Scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on the 3 February 2015.  The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sponsorship.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.

It provides for the making of regulations regarding the marketing and advertising of alcohol and includes provisions, inter alia, for restrictions on broadcast marketing and advertising, cinema advertising, outdoor advertising, print media and the regulation of sponsorship by alcohol companies.  The provisions in relation to marketing and advertising will be reviewed after three years to gauge their effectiveness. <\/p><p>The other measures set out in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, 2012,<\/i>were endorsed by Government and are to be progressed by the relevant Departments and organisations.

The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 and 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.

The safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised.

Decisions on the supply of vaccines into the market are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day.  <\/p><p>The EMA has recently completed a review of the HPV vaccine.

The outcome of the review which was carried out by the EMA Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  <\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  <\/p><p>As of the 27 November, the HPRA has received 936 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  Of the 936 reports received, 933 were associated with use of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and three were associated with Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.  The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  Parents of any child with a suspected adverse reaction following administration of a vaccine are advised to contact the HSE vaccination teams or their general practitioner for advice and are referred for further management if required.<\/p><p>The EMA has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines as there are no new safety concerns regarding HPV vaccines.

There are reductions in the total In-patient\/Daycase waiting list, and in the numbers of patients waiting between 15&ndash;18 months and waiting over 18 months.

All employees including medical staff are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy.  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer.  Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.<\/p>  <p>  I recently announced that the Government has given its approval to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents.  This will be included in the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s draft Bill on Periodic Payment Orders which is well advanced.  The legislation is part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events. <\/p>  <p>  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential.  The intent of this legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure, which is undertaken in good faith and in compliance with national standards.  This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs.  The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure.  <\/p>  <p>  Open disclosure is now HSE policy and therefore any unjustified breach of the policy (as with any HSE policy) will be managed in line with the HSE disciplinary procedures.  Where potential deviations have been identified the Healthcare records must be reviewed to ascertain any documentation in relation to communication with the patient about the adverse event and to establish if any rationale for non-disclosure has been documented.  Where there is no evidence that open disclosure has occurred the incident must be reviewed with the staff involved in the event.  The patient must be informed of the event and the impact of the event explained and acknowledged.  The patient should also be informed of the initial failure to disclose and an appropriate acknowledgement, explanation and apology provided.<\/p>  <p>  From a patient safety perspective the key focus of open disclosure is on learning so that systems and processes can be improved in order to reduce potential future harms to patients.  If a person is not satisfied that a health professional or administrator has fulfilled their obligations regarding open disclosure then that person has recourse to the HSE's complaints procedures.  It is also open to a person to raise a complaint with the appropriate professional regulatory body or with the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100079#WRU04600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services","counter":1210,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100079#WRU04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1211,"qnumday":476,"qnumall":"[42966\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100079#WRU04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will increase support for neonatal care and, in particular, for the roll-out of a retro-transport service to be run in conjunction with the neonatal transport programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1212,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

This provides a legal basis for the various policies and practices which are applied by the Passport Service in the processing of passport applications.  Section 10 of the Act provides that a passport will issue in the name of a citizen as it appears on his\/her birth certificate.  However, a name change for a passport from that which appears on a person&rsquo;s birth certificate is permitted under the Act in situations such as marriage for example.<\/p>  <p>  In cases where name change arises, other than by marriage, civil partnership, adoption or gender change, the Act specifically requires evidence of the use of this new name over a two year period.  While there is discretion under the Act in accepting evidence of usage for less than two years, this has been normally applied in the past to serious cases such as those involving domestic abuse.<\/p>  <p>  While the person in question may have changed her name by deed poll, this is not, of itself, evidence of a change of name.  To determine a person&rsquo;s name at any given moment in time depends upon evidence to support the constant and sustained use of this new identity.  A deed poll merely sets out an intention to change a person&rsquo;s name and does not, by itself, have the effect of changing that person's name.  A deed poll is, therefore, not conclusive evidence of a change of name.<\/p>  <p>  There is no record on the system of a passport application refusal to this person in her new name.  It should, therefore, be noted that her current passport is a travel identity document that is issued under the provisions of the Act and which is accepted at all international border points.  As indicated, it may be replaced with her new name if relevant evidence of the usage of that name is available to her.  If this is the case, she should make a passport application in the new identity well in advance of any future travel that she may have planned.

In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.<\/p>  <p>  Children with autism over the age of four may be eligible for home tuition if a school placement is not available for them.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.<\/p>  <p>  SENOs engage with schools annually in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each year, in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post primary school level to meet demand in a given area.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents are encouraged to liaise with the local SENO to discuss placement options for their child.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will continue to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes, where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.  Where a school opens a special class the NCSE will allocate supports to the class to meet the educational and care needs of the students enrolled.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the mainstream educational provision provided for, there are over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post primary level.  Each special class for autism at post-primary level has a 6:1.5 pupil teacher ratio.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has advised that the school referred to by the Deputy opened an ASD class in September 2015.

Traditionally all of the schools have been multi denominational and provide for children of all religions and none.  This applies equally to the second level schools where a legal agreement was entered into with a diocese or a diocese and religious order at the time the school was formed, often involving the amalgamation of a vocational school and a catholic voluntary secondary school.<\/p>  <p>  These agreements included a provision relating to religious worship and instruction. Notwithstanding that the agreements were entered into with catholic bishops or orders the provision in the agreements requires that the religious worship attended by any pupil and the religious instruction given by the ETB school must be in accordance with the rites, practice and teaching of the religious denomination to which the pupil belongs. The arrangements regarding religious worship and instruction reflect the definition of the schools as being multi-denominational. <\/p>  <p>  The term multi-denominational is also applied by Educate Together in relation to schools under its patronage but the usage can be distinguished from its application to ETB schools as Educate Together schools exclude any religious worship or instruction from the ordinary life of the school, and therefore could be described as non-denominational.<\/p>  <p>  The position of ETB schools and religious worship and instruction is evolving with an agreement reached between one ETB and Educate Together in respect of one school and a second such school in planning by another ETB.

This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.

The Commissioner for Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including the most appropriate method of valuation.\u00a0 The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally are deeply embedded in the local government system.\u00a0 A large body of case law is well established and local authorities and ratepayers are, in the main, very familiar with, and generally accepting of, the operation and practice of the rating system.\u00a0 Rates are also a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial rates are legally payable in two moieties; the first moiety and arrears are payable on the date of the making of the rate and the second moiety is payable on 1 July. In practice local authorities facilitate payments of commercial rates by instalments including by direct debit. As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of due amounts is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in light of prevailing circumstances and in accordance with normal accountancy procedures. <\/p>  <p> I am aware of the continued need to restrain costs on businesses. My Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard. The national average ARV decreased each year from 2010 to 2014; 2015 and 2016 are not directly comparable with previous years due to the local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas. <\/p>  <p>  I have no immediate plans to amend the legislation governing commercial rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100083#WRY00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Exemptions","counter":1418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100083#WRY00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1419,"qnumday":547,"qnumall":"[42530\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100083#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to exempt pensioners from the water charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1420,"content":"<p>A revised water charging regime was announced by the Government on 19 November 2014.

The Valuation Act 2001 comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. <\/p><p>The Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides for global valuations of utility undertakings, to be carried out by the Valuation Office every five years and entered on the central valuation list. The most recent global valuations carried out by the Valuation Office are in respect of Gas Networks Ireland, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and telecommunications companies BT Ireland, Eircom, Vodafone, Three Ireland and Meteor. On 4 November 2015 the Valuation Office issued a copy of the Valuation Certificate and a schedule setting out the apportioned value to each rating authority. The previous valuation for these utilities had taken place in 2010. The Global Valuation Certificates show a reduction in the combined valuations for these utilities of &euro;112m. Moreover, the reduction in the global valuation of the ESB, following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal, will reduce the rates payable by the ESB from 2016.<\/p><p>The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.\u00a0 The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. This process has recently been concluded in each local authority as part of the budgeting process for 2016. The implications of the Commissioner of Valuation&rsquo;s global revaluation of utility infrastructure for individual local authorities will ultimately be dependent on each authority&rsquo;s ARV, and its overall income and expenditure decided on in its budget.<\/p><p>My Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and there will be a once off adjustment in support from the Local Government Fund in 2016 to local authorities affected by the global valuations.<\/p><p>The estimate of the reduction in rates income arising from the new global valuations and the amount of the adjustment in the Local Government Fund in 2016 is set out in the table. The amount of the adjustment per local authority was calculated with reference to the reduction in valuation of each global utility (including the reduction in valuation of the ESB following an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal) in each local authority area, applying the latest available Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) to obtain the estimated reduction in rates income and by reducing the amount by just over 28% to accord with the available funding. <table><tr><th>County Council <\/th><th>Estimate of reduction in income arising from new valuations <\/th><th>Amount of Adjustment in Local Government Fund <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow <\/td><td><div>&euro;243,887 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;175,549 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan <\/td><td><div>&euro;212,638 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;153,056 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare <\/td><td><div>&euro;646,702 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;465,493 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork <\/td><td><div>&euro;1,897,841 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,366,056 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal <\/td><td><div>&euro;717,503 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;516,455 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown <\/td><td><div>&euro;1,045,936 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;752,859 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal* <\/td><td><div>&euro;0 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;0 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway <\/td><td><div>&euro;796,831 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;573,554 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry <\/td><td><div>&euro;835,463 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;601,362 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare <\/td><td><div>&euro;879,403 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;632,989 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny <\/td><td><div>&euro;361,120 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;259,932 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois <\/td><td><div>&euro;252,149 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;181,495 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim <\/td><td><div>&euro;122,730 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;88,341 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford <\/td><td><div>&euro;222,631 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;160,249 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth <\/td><td><div>&euro;399,540 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;287,587 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo <\/td><td><div>&euro;691,776 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;497,937 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath <\/td><td><div>&euro;793,217 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;570,953 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan <\/td><td><div>&euro;195,614 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;140,802 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly <\/td><td><div>&euro;315,895 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;227,379 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon <\/td><td><div>&euro;322,133 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;231,870 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo <\/td><td><div>&euro;267,373 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;192,454 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin <\/td><td><div>&euro;1,337,243 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;962,540 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary <\/td><td><div>&euro;568,963 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;409,537 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath <\/td><td><div>&euro;312,487 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;224,926 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford <\/td><td><div>&euro;533 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;383 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow <\/td><td><div>&euro;749,197 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;539,268 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>City Council <\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork <\/td><td><div>&euro;1,638,904 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,179,674 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin <\/td><td><div>&euro;4,429,335 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;3,188,211 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway <\/td><td><div>&euro;369,492 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;265,959 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>City and County Council <\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick <\/td><td><div>&euro;1,655,398 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;1,191,546 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford <\/td><td><div>&euro;849,664 <\/div><\/td><td><div>&euro;611,584 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><blockquote>*Fingal County Council had already adopted its Budget prior to 4 November 2015. <\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100083#WRY05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff Recruitment","counter":1462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100083#WRY05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1463,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[42525\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100083#WRY05400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when an application by Clare County Council to sanction the position of community warden will be considered and sanctioned;

Mayo County ha s a target of 566 units, supported by &euro; 30.3 m of investment, broken down as follows: <table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>Local Authority Housing\/ <br \/><br \/>AHB delivery via CAS\/ <br \/><br \/>Return of vacant properties<\/th><th><\/th><th>Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme<\/th><th><\/th><th>Rental Accommodation Scheme <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Period <\/td><td>2015-17 <\/td><td>2015 <\/td><td>2016\/7 <\/td><td>2015 <\/td><td>2016\/7 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Social Housing Units <\/td><td>146 <\/td><td>5 0 <\/td><td>137 <\/td><td>115 <\/td><td>118 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The detailed implementation of the programmes and projects to deliver on targets is a matter for each individual local authority, but I am confident that good progress is being made in their achievement. When the targets were announced, it was indicated that the funding would support the refurbishment of vacant social housing units and support local authorities in both building and acquiring housing. Subsequently, I announced new social housing construction projects to the value of approximately half a billion euros, including 39 new units for Mayo at a cost estimate of &euro;7.2 million.

In this regard, Ireland was assigned a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our overall energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  In addition, Member States must ensure that at least 10% of the energy used in the transport sector is from renewable sources by 2020.  The 10% transport target contributes to the overall 16% target, with the additional required contributions coming from renewable electricity (40%) and renewable heat (12%).  <\/p>  <p>  While the cost of any shortfall in Ireland's target of 16% has yet to be established, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that the cost to Ireland may be in the range of &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target.  In arriving at these figures, SEAI used the Irish onshore wind tariff support cost (lower bound) and the UK offshore wind tariff support cost (upper bound) as the cost per megawatt hour (MWh) of purchasing renewable energy credits to meet 2020 targets.  Further work commissioned by SEAI suggests the cost to Ireland may be in the range of &euro;70 million to &euro;140 million per percentage point shortfall (equivalent to &euro;50 to &euro;100 per MWh).  These estimates are based on the projected marginal cost of the renewable energy being brought to market by the selling Member State, with the cost per MWh based solely on the premium component of the tariff support and the type of technology used, ranging, as with SEAI estimates, from onshore wind (lower bound) to offshore wind (upper bound).   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100085#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Service Provision","counter":1556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100085#WRAA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1557,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[42393\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120100085#WRAA01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has plans to invest in improvements to the fixed line broadband network in east County Galway, specifically in the Raheen and Catherlistrane areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
