It is predominately made up of individual self-employed, self-supervised sole traders whose work is generally intrinsically linked to the family home and family life. \u00a0Pressures and difficulties in agricultural work are generally exacerbated by seasonality, periods of peak activity, time pressures and the constant influence of various weather conditions. \u00a0The aim of the HSA is to prevent loss of life, serious injury and ill health arising out of agricultural work activity to farmers, farm families and all who interact with farmers. <\/p><p>In 2017 the HSA aims to improve health and safety in agriculture by &ndash; <\/p><p>- carrying out 2,000 inspections <\/p><p>- continuing the emphasis on engagement with farmers e.g. through knowledge sharing groups, combined with a series of agriculture inspection campaigns both nationally and regionally;<\/p><p>- conducting two agriculture inspection campaigns, each of three weeks&rsquo; duration.\u00a0 The first began on 1<sup>st<\/sup>March and was concerned with livestock safety and the second commenced on 2<sup>nd<\/sup>May and focussed on tractors and machinery.\u00a0 The campaigns had both a national and regional focus and were also supported by media campaigns;<\/p><p>- continuing to deliver coordinated awareness raising\/safety promotion\/training initiatives with major stake holders (e.g. the National Farm Safety Conference which will take place on the 17<sup>th<\/sup>November in Ennis);<\/p><p>- assisting in the implementation of the second year of the Farm Safety Action Plan 2016-2018, developed in conjunction with the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee.\u00a0 This plan lays out a series of specific actions and priorities for tackling the high rates of illness, injury and death on Irish farms including active participation by the HSA in Farm Safety Week which took place in July and the Ploughing Championship in September.<\/p><p>My Department has sanctioned the recruitment of 11 inspector posts for the HSA.

As Minister for Finance I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.<\/p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.\u00a0This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance.\u00a0To achieve this aim, there is a focus on:<\/p>  <p>- prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities,\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>- development of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes, and\u00a0<\/p>  <p>- improving channels of communication between the OPW and the insurance industry in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland has informed me that its members, since 1 June 2014, have factored data on all completed flood defence schemes, provided by the OPW, into its assessment of flood risk within these areas.\u00a0This information has been provided as part of an information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding). The nature of this arrangement is such that it should lead to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas, and at better prices. <\/p>  <p>  While it is not possible for me to comment on individual cases without the full facts, I am advised by the OPW that Bath Avenue Gardens, Dublin 4 is within the benefiting area of the River Dodder Tidal Scheme,\u00a0the details of which have been shared with Insurance Ireland under the Memorandum of Understanding.<\/p>  <p>  I note however, that the River Dodder Tidal Scheme contains 3 demountable defences.

Increasing the provision of flood insurance to households in areas protected by schemes containing demountable defences is a topic which is subject to ongoing discussions between Insurance Ireland, the Department of Finance, and the OPW.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, you should be aware that a consumer can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman in relation to any dealings with a Financial Services or Insurance provider during which they feel they have been unfairly treated.\u00a0In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000065#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tribunals of Inquiry Expenditure","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000065#WRB02300"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[42814\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000065#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 122 of 20 September 2017, the parties that received reimbursement under the section reimbursements to the State Claims Agency in respect of third party claims, which amounts to over &euro;5.4 million up to the end of August 2017.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>The State Claims Agency have advised me that it is not possible, at the present time, to divulge the full details of the seven third-party costs settlements comprising the sum of &euro;5,493,524.00, on grounds of the commercial sensitivity attaching to those settlements, in circumstances where there are other outstanding thirty party Bills of Costs.<\/p>  <p>  However, when all Moriarty Tribunal third party costs have been agreed, it may be possible, at that time, to furnish the details the Deputy has requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000065#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Assessments","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000065#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[42815\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000065#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to basing property tax on income for pensioners similar to the French system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>The 2012 report of the Inter-departmental Group on the Design of a Local Property Tax (the \"Thornhill Group\") comprehensively examined the basis of assessment for the Local Property Tax (LPT). The report favoured the use of market value of residential properties as the basis of assessment and this recommendation was accepted by the Government. The Group considered that under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property would be related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it was located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood. There would be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the properties. <\/p>  <p>  At the request of the Minister for Finance, the operation of the LPT was reviewed in 2015 by Dr. Thornhill. A number of submissions to the review favoured changing the basis of determination of LPT liabilities to site value, floor area or variations thereof. Dr. Thornhill considered these but remained of the view that market value is the most appropriate and equitable basis on which to determine LPT liabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended provides for a system of deferral and partial deferral arrangements in\u00a0certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax.

The deferral\/partial deferral option also attracts an annual interest charge of 4%.<\/p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting.

Those changes came into effect on 9 December 2015 and reduced the costs of accepting card payments, as interchange fees make up part of the merchant service charge collected by acquirers from retailers. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank does provide other credit and debit card statistics, including the number of debit and credit cards currently in issue to Irish residents, and these are available on the website of the Central Bank.

The set-off was limited to 50% of the\u00a0profit in any given year. It did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but\u00a0instead lengthened the period over which they could be used. Section 396C was\u00a0introduced as a form of claw-back\u00a0for the taxpayer. <\/p><p>However,\u00a0with the introduction of the new capital rules on\u00a01 January 2014 under CRD IV and the State having acquired ownership positions in the banks,\u00a0it no longer served its original purpose and accordingly, in the Finance Act 2014, the Minister for Finance deemed it appropriate to remove the provision. The removal of Section 396C\u00a0put the covered banks in the same position as other\u00a0corporates including other banks operating in Ireland. Indeed\u00a0I would\u00a0highlight\u00a0for the\u00a0Deputy\u00a0that the provision which allows the carry-forward of tax losses for set-off against future trading profits is available not only for banks but for all Irish corporates. This is a standard tax policy internationally.<\/p><p>In relation to the impact on the banks of changing the treatment losses that can be brought forward, I can confirm that an analysis was carried out in late 2013 as part of the preparations for the Finance Bill 2014 when S396c of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 was repealed. <\/p><p>To recognise the part that the banks played in the financial crisis, in 2013, the Government also decided that the banking sector should make an annual contribution of approximately &euro;150 million to the Exchequer for the period from 2014 to 2016. In Budget 2016, the payment of this levy was extended until 2021. The bank levy is expected to raise &euro;750 million over the five years.<\/p><p>My Department\u00a0requested that each of the banks to respond to the\u00a0Deputy's query and received the following information.<\/p><p><b>Bank of Ireland:<\/b><\/p><p>&quot;In 2016, the Group paid taxes of &euro;263m to the Irish State and collected taxes of &euro;858m on behalf of the Irish State. In the first six months of 2017, the Group paid taxes of &euro;96m to the Irish State and collected taxes of &euro;455m on behalf of the Irish State. Note 19 on page 81 of the published Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 contains the Group&rsquo;s disclosures on the deferred tax asset that has been recognised in respect of historical trading losses. At 30 June 2017, deferred tax assets include an amount of &euro;1,251 million in respect of tax losses which are available to relieve future profits from tax. Of these losses, approximately &euro;1.1 billion relates to Irish tax losses and &euro;0.1 billion relates to UK tax losses. It is currently projected that the deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses will be recovered in full by the end of 2038.<\/p><p>&quot;The deferred tax assets have been recognised on the basis that it is probable the tax losses will be recovered as the Directors are satisfied that it is probable that the Group will have sufficient future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets can be utilised. Under current Irish and UK tax legislation there is no time restriction on the utilisation of trading losses.&quot;<\/p><p><b>AIB: <\/b><\/p><p>&quot;Information in relation to AIB&rsquo;s Deferred Tax Asset are contained on Pages 257-259 and Pages 296&ndash;298 of the 2016 Annual Financial Report and Page 115 of the 2017 Half-Yearly Financial Report. At 31 December 2016, AIB Group recognised deferred tax assets of &euro;2,928 million arising from unused Irish tax losses. No deferred tax assets were recognised in respect of other unused Irish tax losses of &euro;122 million.<\/p><p>&quot;Under Irish tax legislation, there is no limit on the period of time for which any company can carry forward losses incurred in its trade for offset against future profits for the same trade. <\/p><p>&quot;Notwithstanding that AIB is carrying forward large amounts of trade tax losses, it also pays significant amounts of tax in Ireland such as the bank levy, corporation tax on capital gains and on non-trading income, irrecoverable VAT on purchases, and employer&rsquo;s PRSI. In addition, it remits to the Revenue taxes collected from others including PAYE, USC and PRSI relating to its c. 10,000 employees.&quot;<\/p><p><b>PTSB:<\/b><\/p><p>&quot;As noted in PTSB&rsquo;s 2016 Annual Report, the PTSB Group recognised a deferred tax asset on tax losses carried forward of &euro;373m at 31 December 2016.

The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and effective condition.  The annual maintenance programme typically involves some clearance of vegetation and removal of silt build-up on an average five-yearly cycle.

However it is not in a position to give details in relation to the timing or frequency of tours and it is not currently involved in any marketing of the site; however, it was the general  understanding that during 2016, the Centre made tours available on demand during normal working hours in the summer months as required by visitor arrivals in their facility in Kiltyclogher.<\/p>  <p>  The Centre was not in a position to provide services to the Cottage in 2017 and is currently closed.  The OPW remains open to the possibility of assisting a local initiative at the site and has indicated publicly recently that funding support options remain available.  The OPW has also indicated that it will support initiatives such as publication distribution, creating an online presence and any other measures designed to increase awareness of the property.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000067#WRD02850","answer":true,"speaker":"1363"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Service Staff Data","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000067#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[42679\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000067#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of principal officer grade positions in the Civil Service;

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.  <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the sale. This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and apprenticeships. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this, newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward Circular which reduced the qualifying period from a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs. In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers included a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before. <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost (including new entrants recruited this September) would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. <\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servant and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all. It would not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000068#WRE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":295,"content":"<p>Question No. 98 answered with Question No. 91.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000068#WRE03400"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[42555\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000068#WRE03500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will address the request for a fifth year teacher and adequate resourcing and supports by a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1304","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, St. Thomas Special School is a school which caters for boys who are members of the Traveller community.

This is a substantial allocation of hours for a school of this size. <\/p>  <p>  Whereas the profiled allocation had indicated a need of 67.50 hours for this school, based on its school profile and size, and relative to the profiled needs of all other schools, the school was allocated 68.90 hours, which was equivalent to the allocation the school received in 2016\/17. <\/p>  <p>  There has therefore been no reduction to the allocation of special educational needs teaching support for this school.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged and accepted that schools will have some additional pupils with special educational needs enrolling to their school subsequent to the profiles having been developed. <\/p>  <p>  However, for the most part these will be balanced by the fact that some students who had additional teaching needs in the previous year will have left the school. The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils. This school also has some additional capacity in the retained element of its allocation which is above that indicated by the school profile.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.   <\/p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the previous model which had been in place. <\/p>  <p>  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. <\/p>  <p>  A process has also been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process due to the fact that the school had rapidly developing status where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17\/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12\/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).<\/p>  <p>  Schools who have qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts on the basis of developing growth in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has issued guidelines for schools to support them in the management of their resources. These guidelines are available on my Departments website.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to take guidelines on board in the planning process for the 2017\/18 school year. In order to determine the levels of need within each school, it will be important for schools to have properly identified students with additional learning needs and have developed plans for each student indicating how the supports available will be used. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will be available to support schools where these plans have been developed and implemented but the school considers that further support may be required. This support may involve Continuing Professional Development or further training for school staff, advice in relation to the support plan that is in place, and possibly a review process once schools can clearly demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have arisen in the school.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will shortly be advising how schools can seek a review of the utilisation of their allocations in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000068#WRE05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000068#WRE05300"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[42628\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000068#WRE05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if funding will be allocated for parking facilities at a school (details supplied).","asker":"1354","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has no record of receiving correspondence from the school to which he refers relating to the facilities in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000068#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000068#WRE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[42633\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000068#WRE05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to reconsider the new provision limiting secondments for the purpose of serving as directors for education support centres.","asker":"1354","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>My Department arranges for the secondment of teachers from their teaching posts for the purpose of developing and providing CPD for teachers and for appointment as Directors of Education Support Centres (ESC's).<\/p>  <p>  By their nature, secondments are not permanent appointments and are renewed each year subject to ongoing need and policy requirements.  <\/p>  <p>  Secondment arrangements provide flexibility and ensure that the in-service needs of teachers and other support priorities of the school system can be met within the resources available. Having teachers with relevant and recent teaching experience and expertise is a key requirement for the role.

In this way, their expertise and knowledge is not lost to the system.

A reply will issue shortly to the group in relation to this correspondence.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas. My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.<\/p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to demand for particular models of school provision, it should be noted that the patronage process for new schools is a separate process which has been in place since 2011.  This process is run after it has been decided that a new school is required.  Parental preferences are central to this process and prospective patrons are required to provide evidence of demand for their particular school model and medium of instruction. Therefore, where, based on demographics, it might be indicated that a new school is required, it cannot be guaranteed that this would be a school under a particular type of patronage as this will be dependent to a large degree on parental preferences in the area at the time of a patronage process. <\/p>  <p>  As with other school planning areas nationwide, the demographic data for these school planning areas is being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and updated enrolment data.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Every child therefore has access to educational psychological assessment services either through the NEPS or SCPA psychologist.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <\/p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational development of any student that these should be raised, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to the Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS office. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000069#WRF04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staff Data","counter":372,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000069#WRF04200"},{"type":"question","counter":373,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[42837\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000069#WRF04300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost of employing extra special needs assistants for every ten employed.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":374,"content":"<p>The initial cost of employing 10 additional Special Needs Assistants for one year would be approximately &euro;323,000.\u00a0 This is inclusive\u00a0of the cost of employers PRSI.<\/p>  <p>  Special need assistants are paid on an incremental salary scale and accordingly the cost of their employment would increase in subsequent years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An additional 975 SNA posts have been made available for allocation to schools from September 2017 which is a 7.5% increase to meet the demands for the new school year.\u00a0 A total of 13,990 SNA posts are now available at a\u00a0gross annual cost of &euro;458 million. \u00a0This is more SNAs than we have ever had previously and will ensure that all children who qualify for SNA support can continue to receive access to such support.\u00a0 In total, the number of SNAs available has increased by\u00a0over 32% since 2011, when 10,575 posts were available.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0As the Deputy may be aware, the NCSE are currently undertaking a Comprehensive Assessment of the SNA Scheme.

SNA support will only be provided for behaviour related care needs where there is a clear diagnosis of Emotional Behavioural Disturbance\/Severe Emotional Behavioural Disturbance, or a behavioural disorder in conjunction with another disability, and also where it is clear that behavioural management strategies have not been successful to date, and where it is demonstrated how access to SNA support can assist the\u00a0student. <\/p><p>There are currently over 13,000 special educational needs teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools\u00a0which includes\u00a0an additional 900 teaching posts provided to support the\u00a0introduction of the new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools from September 2017. \u00a0<\/p><p>In addition, 169 new Special Classes have been opened for the 2016\/17 school year, which means there are now over 1,300 special classes in place, compared to 548 special classes in 2011. 1,042 special classes cater for students diagnosed with ASD (including 103 Early Intervention ASD special classes) and 11 cater specifically for students diagnosed with severe emotional behavioural disorders.<\/p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those students with complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with severe behavioural disorders.<\/p><p>Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service through the Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO), or the National Behavioural Support Service, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.<\/p><p>The Special Education Support Service (SESS) now also part of NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service, provides continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers working with students with special educational needs, including training for teachers in the area of challenging behaviour and Autism. <\/p><p>Many schools withdraw students occasionally from the main classroom for short periods of time in order to provide support to them, or to manage student behaviour, if a\u00a0student is exhibiting behaviours which may be a danger to themselves or others.<\/p><p>In some circumstances, a student who is exhibiting extreme behaviours may be brought to another room to ensure the safety of other students and until they are calm again.

It is a matter for the school authorities, the student and the parents or guardians of the student concerned. <\/p><p>Some schools also have multi-sensory rooms that provide a variety of sensory stimuli and which are designed to provide sensory stimulation for students with special educational needs, in spaces which are designed to encourage positive actions and responses for students with sensory impairment.

Schools\u00a0are frontloaded with resources to provide additional\u00a0teaching support to all pupils who need such support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Circulars note that for the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding 2016\/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new model for each school.<\/p>  <p>  This means that on the introduction of the new allocation model and until allocations are reviewed, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, which is less than the allocation they had received to support pupils with Low Incidence special educational needs during the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  This also means that no allocation for pupils made by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p>  <p>  Whereas schools will have greater discretion as to how they can distribute resources under the new model, based on the individual needs of pupils, no reduction in allocations have been made to schools in respect of any pupils who were previously in receipt of a Low Incidence special needs allocation in that school.<\/p>  <p>  A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being\u00a0finalised by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) <\/p>  <p>  This model will take account of the decision making process and qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. <\/p>  <p>  For the next re profiling of the model, the Complex Needs category will be the existing low incidence allocations for schools, less any leavers included in this category, plus additional allocations for any new complex needs category pupils, over the period of time since the first school profiles were developed, to the point of the next re-profiling of the model. <\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has issued guidelines for schools to support them in the management of their SEN teaching resources.  These guidelines are available on my Departments website.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to take guidelines on board in the planning process for the 2017\/18 school year. In order to determine the levels of need within each school, it will be important for schools to have properly identified students with additional learning needs and have developed plans for each student indicating how the supports available will be used.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for the management of behaviour in schools is a matter for individual schools.

Department policy is that students with special educational needs should be included where possible and appropriate in mainstream placements with additional supports provided. <\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are provided for.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for special education provision in 2017 will amount to some &euro;1.68 billion, which is equivalent to approximately 19% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training and represents an increase in spending in this area of 12% over the last two years.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently over 13,000 special educational Needs teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools with an additional 900 teaching posts provided to support the\u00a0introduction of the new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools from September 2017. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This year, 13,990 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are available for allocation to primary and post primary schools to the end of the 2016\/17 school year, which is an increase of 32% in the number of posts available since 2011.  SNA Circular 0030\/2014 details the circumstances in which SNA support will be provided for behaviour related care needs.  SNA support will only be provided for behaviour related care needs where there is a clear diagnosis of Emotional Behavioural Disturbance\/Severe Emotional Behavioural Disturbance, or a behavioural disorder in conjunction with another disability, and also where it is clear that behavioural management strategies have not been successful to date, and where it is demonstrated how access to SNA support can assist the child. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the NCSE are currently undertaking a Comprehensive Assessment of the SNA Scheme. In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive\u00a0assessment, I requested the NCSE to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing a better model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs.<\/p>  <p>  This Working Group has commenced its work and it\u00a0will run in tandem with the completion of the overall Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme. It is intended that the reports of the Working Group and of the Review will be completed in Spring 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Schools may seek advice from their local National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) psychologist, from the NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service through the Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO), or from the National Behavioural Support Services, as to how children with behavioural needs can best be supported in school.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) now also part of NCSE&rsquo;s Support Service, provides continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers working with students with special educational needs, including training for teachers in the area of challenging behaviour and Autism.  My Department is also currently examining the issue of developing guidelines for schools on the specific issue of restraint or intervention.<\/p>  <p>  Published guidelines which are available to schools include:<\/p>  <p>  - Supporting Students with Behavioural, Emotional, and Social difficulties, which is available on the Department's website www.education.ie;<\/p>  <p>  - the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) guidelines for schools on Developing a Code of Behaviour and the National Educational Psychological Services document Behavioural Emotional and Social Difficulties - a Continuum of Support: Guidelines for Teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teacher Recruitment","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG01200"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[42901\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans in place to deal with the critical shortage of substitute teachers; and his further plans to tackle the shortage of Irish language teachers in secondary schools.","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>In overall terms, my Department has no evidence of a recent or current shortage of primary teachers.\u00a0 However, I am\u00a0aware that some schools have experienced difficulty in recruiting adequately qualified substitute teachers, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing this issue. <\/p>  <p>The final report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; was published on 9th   June 2017.\u00a0 The report focusses on the development of\u00a0a model of primary teacher supply, while outlining the work which will be required to establish a sustainable long term model of post primary teacher supply.\u00a0In considering the model of teacher supply at primary level the report took account of many variables, including the number of additional teachers required to cover for teacher absences, such as illness, maternity leave, career break or secondment.<\/p>  <p>  The report sets out an approach to planning the work necessary to develop a model for achieving a better balance between teacher supply and demand in the medium to long term.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Officials of my Department are now considering how the development of a model can be progressed, from within available resources.

The identified actions in the Policy to achieve this aim includes increasing the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary Initial Teacher Education programme and the granting of two additional post to the Post-graduate Masters in Education in NUI Galway to increase teacher supply at post-primary level and strengthen Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects. It is anticipated that these action should also increase the supply of Irish language teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":414,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG01500"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[42902\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to tackle the shortage of behavioural therapists in some regions and the two year waiting list experienced by students to access the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS.

","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>As a consequence of the financial crisis, there was a need to enact a number of measures to reduce public expenditure so as to stabilise the country&rsquo;s public finances. A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the sale. This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and apprenticeships. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this, newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward Circular which reduced the qualifying period from a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs. In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers included a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before. <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost (including new entrants recruited this September) would be in the order of &euro;130 million. Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher. <\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servant and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all. It would not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on. <\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":427,"content":"<p>Question No. 147 answered with Question No. 92.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Administration","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG02900"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[42908\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to provide greater access to administration services for smaller schools that have a teaching principal (details supplied).","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>Circular 12\/2016, which is available on the Department website, outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.

The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils. This school also has some additional capacity in the retained element of its allocation to absorb additional pupil movement.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis,\u00a0as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the previous model which had been in place. <\/p>  <p>  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.\u00a0 Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations. <\/p>  <p>  A process has also\u00a0been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process due to the fact that the school had rapidly developing\u00a0status where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p>  <p>  This process also takes into account the position for new schools who may be rapidly expanding.<\/p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17\/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12\/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).<\/p>  <p>  Schools who have qualified for additional mainstream developing school posts on the basis of developing growth in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has also issued guidelines for schools to support them in the management of their resources. These guidelines are available on my Departments website.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to take guidelines on board in the planning process for the 2017\/18 school year. In order to determine the levels of need within each school, it will be important for schools to have properly identified students with additional learning needs and have developed plans for each student indicating how the supports available will be used. <\/p>  <p>  In this context, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will be available to support schools where these plans have been developed and implemented but the school considers that further support may be required. This support may involve Continuing Professional Development or further training for school staff, advice in relation to the support plan that is in place, and possibly a review process once schools can clearly demonstrate that exceptional circumstances have arisen in the school.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will shortly be advising how schools can seek a review of the utilisation of their allocations in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The exceptional circumstances cited by this school can be considered as part of this review process.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the provision of a special class in the school, I wish to advise that\u00a0the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE continues to\u00a0establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs, including Autism as required.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will liaise with the school referred to by the Deputy to establish whether there is a\u00a0need to open a special class for pupils with Autism in this school, prior to the moving of the school to\u00a0its new temporary location, and\u00a0taking account\u00a0of current special class placement availability in\u00a0the local area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG06200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG06300"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[43020\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG06400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":462,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that a building project for\u00a0the school in question\u00a0is included in my Department's 6 Year Construction Programme. <\/p><p>The preparatory work required to initiate the architectural planning process for this building project is\u00a0currently underway and\u00a0as part of this process,\u00a0my Department\u00a0recently met with\u00a0the Local\u00a0Authority.<\/p><p>My Department will\u00a0be in further contact\u00a0with the school authority during\u00a0the architectural planning process.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Teaching Qualifications","counter":463,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG06600"},{"type":"question","counter":464,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[42202\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000070#WRG06700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason secondary teachers are required to complete a two year masters degree to qualify rather than a higher diploma; and his views on whether this is leading to cost pressures on young graduates.

The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision.  In deciding on the location of a special class SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision and they must be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located.

This is a substantial allocation of hours for a school of this size.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Whereas the profiled allocation had indicated a need of\u00a045 hours for this school, based on its school profile and size, and relative to the profiled needs of all other schools, the school was allocated\u00a046.03 hours, which was equivalent to the allocation the school received in 2016\/17.  There has therefore been no reduction to the allocation for this school.<\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged and accepted that schools will have some additional pupils with special educational needs enrolling to their school subsequent to the profiles having been developed. <\/p>  <p>  However, for the most part these will be balanced by the fact that some students who had additional teaching needs in the previous year will have left the school.  The baseline is also designed to ensure that schools have some capacity to provide additional support to pupils.  This school also has some additional capacity in the retained element of its allocation which is above that indicated by the school profile.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours\u00a0may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis,\u00a0as schools will now receive\u00a0a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including\u00a0where\u00a0a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or\u00a0where there are\u00a0newly\u00a0enrolling pupils\u00a0to the school. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the previous model which had been in place. <\/p>  <p>  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students\u00a0with additional teaching needs will\u00a0leave and others will\u00a0enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally\u00a0be adjusted between allocations. <\/p>  <p>  A process has also\u00a0been put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process due to the fact that the school had rapidly developing\u00a0status where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in DES Circular 17\/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) and DES 10,11,12\/2017 (Post Primary School Staffing Schedule).<\/p>  <p>  Schools who have qualified of additional mainstream developing school posts on the basis of developing growth in accordance with these criteria will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has issued guidelines for schools to support them in the management of their resources.  These guidelines are available on my Departments website.<\/p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to take guidelines on board in the planning process for the 2017\/18 school year.

Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. <\/p><p>I am pleased to announce today that I have secured sufficient funding to provide for the recruitment of another 800 new Garda recruits in 2018, which will ensure that the planned Garda strength of 15,000 by 2021 remains on course to be achieved. Budget 2018 will also facilitate the recruitment of a further 500 civilians and the strengthening of the Reserve.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014,\u00a0that\u00a0close to\u00a0 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of which 119 were assigned to the DMR West Division, 17 of which were assigned following\u00a0last September's attestation.  I understand that another\u00a0200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to allow\u00a0to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the DMR West Division, in the coming years.<\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that as of the 31\u00a0August\u00a02017, the latest date for which figures are available, the Garda\u00a0strength of Clondalkin,\u00a0Lucan, Ronanstown and Rathcoole\u00a0Garda Stations from\u00a02012 up to 2017\u00a0are as set out in the tables below. <\/p><p>Garda Strength by Station 2012 - 2017\u00a0<table><tr><th>Station<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><th>2017*<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td>95<\/td><td>91<\/td><td>89<\/td><td>87<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>99<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lucan<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>72<\/td><td>74<\/td><td>73<\/td><td>74<\/td><td>69<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ronanstown<\/td><td>93<\/td><td>91<\/td><td>91<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>91<\/td><td>93<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rathcoole<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><\/table><b>*Up to 31 August 2017<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000072#WRJ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigrant Investor Programme Administration","counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000072#WRJ04100"},{"type":"question","counter":571,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[42503\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000072#WRJ04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a project (details supplied) was referred to the immigrant investor programme committee; if so, the reason it was not successful; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":572,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department that enquiries were made to officials in the Immigrant Investor Programme Unit in relation to\u00a0the project referred to by the Deputy.

There are, therefore, no delays in dealing with such applications.<\/p><p>In provincial locations Barring Order applications are generally listed for the next dedicated family law day (most Districts have at least 1 day per month dedicated to family law only).  This means that such cases are generally listed for hearing between 2 - 6 weeks from the issue date.  There are exceptions, however, and in some instances the first listing for the hearing of a barring order summons may be up to 14 weeks.  Applications for Barring Orders are prioritised within court lists and a decision is generally made on such applications on the first listing date.  Where adjournments occur they are generally granted at the request of one or both parties.<\/p><p>The President of the District Court as well as the Courts Service will continue to monitor the position in regard to waiting times and the length of court lists and where possible appropriate consideration will be given to allocating additional judicial resources to address any issues that may arise.<\/p><p>The 2011-2016 Programme for Government contained a commitment to establish a &ldquo;<i>distinct and separate system of family courts to streamline family law court processes and make them more efficient and less costly<\/i>&rdquo; and draft legislation is in preparation to give effect to this commitment. <\/p><p>A working group comprised of the Department, the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board is currently in place to examine, among other things, how the new Family Court would operate on the ground and what are the implications for family law cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000072#WRJ07200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Remit","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[42630\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has engaged with the Courts Service regarding affording greater involvement to wards of courts and their families with the wards of courts funds and the funds of minors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the High Court has jurisdiction in wards of court matters and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998. <\/p>  <p>  In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that when a person is taken into wardship, the President of the High Court appoints a committee, usually a relative (or relatives) of the ward, to deal with the ward's property and it is the responsibility of the President of the High Court to ensure that the estate of the ward is protected.  It is standard procedure for funds of the ward to be brought under the custody of the court for investment by the Accountant of the Courts of Justice in accordance with the directions of the President of the High Court and the Registrar of the Office of Wards of Court.  Investment of court funds is carried out in line with the strategies devised and reviewed on a regular basis by the Investment Committee, chaired by the President of the High Court.<\/p>  <p>  The Investment Committee reviews the investment strategies with the assistance of its investment advisors to ensure the protection and suitable investment of funds of wards, minors and others lodged in court for the benefit of those persons.

When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. <\/p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner, that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 33 of whom have been assigned to the Cavan \/ Monaghan Division.

To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Lobbying Data","counter":641,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK04100"},{"type":"question","counter":642,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[42295\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of occasions on which he has been lobbied in respect of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill since March 2016; the persons he has met with; the dates of these meetings; the details of the basis of the lobbying; his views on the issues raised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":643,"content":"<p>Since taking up office as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have been lobbied by organisations registered on the Register of Lobbyists under the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 in respect of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill on two occasions.

To inform future decisions around the use of the Reserve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting a strategic review as a matter of priority with a view to completion before the end of this year. As a first step the Garda Executive has taken a decision to transfer the management of the Reserve from the Human Resource and People Development Directorate to the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for Community Engagement. This is intended to ensure that its development and deployment is viewed more broadly through a community policing lens. This is a very welcome step as it is my strong view that the greatest dividend to be gained from the Reserve is in terms of a visible presence on the ground engaging with local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK05600"},{"type":"question","counter":657,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[42365\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of community garda&iacute; in each district in each of the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":658,"content":"<p>I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the Garda Commissioner and I will write to the Deputy on receipt of same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Expenditure","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK05900"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[42366\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK06000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount of funding allocated to each division in each of the past ten years for the purposes of establishing or supporting text alert, community alert or neighbourhood watch schemes, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities. This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will also be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders; for example, the well established Community Alert Programme and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme to name but a few.  <\/p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  Since the Community Text Alert scheme was launched in September 2013, it has developed as an important crime prevention mechanism with over 700 local groups involving in excess of 130,000 subscribers and with an estimated 200,000 text messages sent each month under the scheme. Every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that funding from my Department is not used to provide direct assistance to Neighbourhood Watch Groups or any local Community Alert (or Text Alert) Groups.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Community Alert, funding is allocated by my Department for the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers. These Development Officers, operating in Muintir Na T&iacute;re, provide support to Community and Text Alert schemes and offer advice on how to establish new schemes. The long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to the Department to support effective community crime prevention actions. <\/p>  <p>  At the National Ploughing Championships this year, I was pleased to announce that an additional &euro;100,000 was being made available to Text Alert Groups, registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to provide modest financial assistance with the running costs they incur each year.  This Text Alert Rebate Scheme will be administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re and Groups wishing to participate at the Scheme can find more details at www.muintiir.ie. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am pleased to announce that I have also secured an additional &euro;100,000 in the budget announced today for local crime prevention initiatives, including the text alert scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":662,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK06200"},{"type":"question","counter":663,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[42367\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK06300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; over each of the past ten years, by rank and division, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":664,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that on 31 August 2017, the latest date for which figures are currently available, the number of Garda&iacute; was 13,293.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. <\/p><p>This plan is progressing apace. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years. <\/p><p>This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute; over each of the past ten years by Rank and Division is as set out in the following tables.<\/p><p><b>Garda Strength by Division and Rank 2008<\/b><table><tr><th>DIVISION<\/th><th>GD<\/th><th>SG<\/th><th>IN<\/th><th>SU<\/th><th>CS<\/th><th>AC<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan \/ Monaghan<\/td><td>332<\/td><td>72<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>418<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare<\/td><td>283<\/td><td>44<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>337<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>550<\/td><td>106<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>678<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork North<\/td><td>242<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork West<\/td><td>258<\/td><td>43<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td>313<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>D.M.R.

Chapter 6 of the Report is dedicated to the specific needs of female offenders.   Work is underway to progress these recommendations. The Penal Policy Implementation Oversight Group has published three Progress Reports which are available to view on my Department&rsquo;s website. I expect to publish the fourth report in the near future. The recommendations in respect of females are also included in actions 2.12 &amp;amp; 2.13 of the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020. <\/p>  <p>  Further, the Probation Service and Irish Prison Service Joint Strategic Women's Plan puts in place a structure for these two agencies to work more effectively with this vulnerable group in society.  The Probation Service works very closely with a wide variety of statutory, voluntary and community services and resources.  Prompt referral and effective communication with a variety of agencies is beneficial and a key aspect of the model used by the Probation Service in working with women. Focussed interventions help reduce offending, improve opportunities for reintegration and to improve outcomes more generally.<\/p>  <p>  The Abigail Women's Centre run by DePaul Ireland (Tus Nua) was opened in a north Dublin suburb, in December 2014.  This is a Probation Service funded project working with women leaving prison or on probation supervision and provides these women with a safe and positive supported environment.  It is a dedicated women's initiative involving a range of agencies working together including the Dublin Regional Housing Executive, Dublin City Council, Probation Service, Irish Prison Service, Health Service Executive and the Dublin City Education and Training Board. <\/p>  <p>  In the afore-mentioned Joint Strategic Women's Plan, the Irish Prison Service gave a commitment to explore the development of an open centre for women assessed as low risk of re-offending.  This option was explored by a joint Irish Prison Service\/Probation Service working group. Having considered the matter, it decided that rather than developing an open centre, a step down facility for women was a more practical and cost effective approach. The Irish Prison Service and Probation Service are in the process of tendering for the development of a step down unit for women in Dublin. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000073#WRK07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prison Service Strategies","counter":676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000074#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":677,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[42384\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000074#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his strategy to develop an open prison for women as an alternative to overcrowding in the D&oacute;chas centre and Limerick women's prison.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":678,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that in the joint Probation Service\/Irish Prison Service Women's Strategy 2014 - 2016, An Effective Response to Women Who Offend, published in 2014, the Irish Prison Service made a commitment to explore the development of an open centre\/open conditions for women assessed as low risk of re-offending.<\/p>  <p>  This commitment was acknowledged in the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy which also recommended a greater focus on step down facilities, supported accommodation, the use of more community based open conditions for female offenders and the provision of an open centre for women.  <\/p>  <p>  A joint Irish Prison Service\/Probation Service Working Group was then established to consider an open centre for women.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to deliver this objective in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment, as well as the High Tech Arrangement, is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017.<\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, it is essential that the resources invested in medicines are used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies across the supply chain and also the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>In 2013, the HSE established the Medicines Management Programme (MMP).  It is headed by the (NMIC) and the (NCPE), in collaboration with the (HSE-PCRS), and provides sustained national leadership on issues such as medicines management, access to medicines and the cost effective provision of medicines in Ireland.  The MMP has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve evidence-based and cost-effective prescribing nationally and the review of Versatis is an example of this.<\/p><p>Versatis 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  Following an MMP review of the evidence available for the use of Versatis, the HSE introduced a new system for reimbursement of Versatis from 1 September 2017.  This process will support the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to have receive this treatment.  The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Versatis has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  Initially, the projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication.  However, total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, due to off-license use as a general treatment for pain not associated with shingles.  Currently, over 25,000 patients are in receipt of this item.  The MMP report highlighted that the clinical evidence for Versatis in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain.  The NCPE estimates that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of the prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN.<\/p><p>All patients who currently receive antivirals for shingles, or patients who are prescribed antivirals for shingles in the future, will automatically be approved for Versatis for three months.  No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy will be notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017.  However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer be dispensed Versatis under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has produced patient information leaflets and advised GPs on treatment alternatives.<\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be dispensed for unlicensed indications.

The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that in recent times some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position of the Government and the Oireachtas that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may make a complaint to the HSE Local Health Office, who will deal with the matter in accordance with the HSE's Complaints Policy.  In order to achieve clarity on this issue, I have asked that any difference of perspective in relation to the provision of phlebotomy services be addressed in the GP contractual review process, which is currently underway.  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.<\/p>  <p>  The GMS contract stipulates that fees are not paid to GPs by the HSE in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, \"under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences\".

To date this group has met seven times.<\/p><p>The Expert Group is tasked with the development of clinical guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme.

This has involved continuous ongoing dialogue between the Experts and third parties throughout this initiative.  The Group conducted a targeted consultation on the draft guidance, which will be finalised shortly.

The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the granting of such a licence must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has published extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website.  This contains information for the public on protection measures as well as information for healthcare professionals on diagnostics measures and clinical management.  The website address is:<\/p><p><i>www.hpsc.ie\/a-z\/vectorborne\/lymedisease\/<\/i>. <\/p><p>Lyme borelliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment Regulations) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows: 2012 - 8 cases, 2013 - 13 cases, 2014 - 18 cases, 2015 - 12 cases, and 2016 - 21 cases (provisional).  However, recent estimates suggest that, due to underreporting of mild cases, there may be up to 50-100 cases in Ireland per year.  The Weekly Infectious Disease Report, published by the HPSC on 4 October 2017, indicated that for week 39-2017 (24\/9\/17-30\/9\/17) there have been 10 cases notified so far in 2017 &ndash; a decrease of 4 on the same period last year.<\/p><p>Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful consideration of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is provided routinely by all major, regional hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory Service of Public Health England in the Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  All laboratories must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics. <\/p><p>Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, then management of patients can be undertaken by Infectious Disease consultants in regional hospitals when intravenous antibiotics may be considered as a method of treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000078#WRP02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres","counter":981,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000078#WRP03000"},{"type":"question","counter":982,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[42701\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000078#WRP03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the opening hours for the Derrinturn and Johnstownbridge health centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":983,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000078#WRP03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","counter":984,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000078#WRP03300"},{"type":"question","counter":985,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[42708\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000078#WRP03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the waiting list times for occupational therapists assessments in the regional autism services, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":986,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[42709\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000078#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will be seeking more funding for autism services in budget 2018 (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":987,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[42710\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000078#WRP03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the average waiting time for children on the autism spectrum looking to access preschool services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":988,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 to 344, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

However, it should be noted that typically the HSE does not operate a 'vacancy rate', but rather records a staff turnover rate. The HSE estimates that for 2016, the adjusted turnover rate was 5.7%.  This means that, each year, at any one time, people will be moving in and out of about 1 in 20 posts across the HSE.  This can be for a range of reasons such as simply moving to a new location but still within the HSE, retirements, resignations or other types of leave such as maternity leave. When a position is vacated, work may be covered through a variety of measures such as redeployment, restructuring or reallocation of the work.  Also, it may be necessary for the duties to be covered by agency or overtime.  <\/p>  <p>  The need to increase the numbers of consultants, doctors, nurses and midwives in the public health service is a priority for me, my Department and the HSE against a backdrop of global shortages. <\/p>  <p>  At the end of August 2017 there were 2,913 whole time equivalent consultants in the public health services.  This is 103 more than the end August 2016 figure and an increase of over 700 in the past decade. At the end of August there were 6,209 whole time equivalent NCHDs, an increase of 278 on the August 2016 figure and an increase of over 1,300 in the past decade. The HSE has been focused on addressing issues associated with the creation and approval of consultant posts and successful recruitment. It is now giving effect to the report 'Towards Successful Consultant Recruitment, Appointment and Retention', completed in December 2016. It is also focused on implementing the recommendations of the 'MacCraith Group' to support the recruitment and retention of NCHDs.<\/p>  <p>  The Nursing Recruitment and Retention Agreement concluded with the INMO and SIPTU Nursing earlier this year committed to increasing the number of nurses and midwives by 1,224 additional permanent posts in 2017. The recent quarterly progress report (30th Sept 2017) from the HSE states that the HSE has filled 20% of the target posts.  However, the report shows that there is an increase of 739 whole time equivalents between August 2016 and August 2017.  In addition, the HSE is currently concluding the process of offering all graduating nurses and midwives permanent contracts and is focused on the conversion of agency employees into HSE direct employees. This is expected to deliver a significant increase in staff nurse numbers between now and year-end.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission will also be examining the reasons behind the recruitment and retention issues faced by some public service grades in the next phase of its work.  This will include certain health sector grades, including doctors, nurses and radiographers.

That said, it is a comprehensive legislative undertaking which must also now take account of the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 which was enacted after completion of the Expert Group Report.

I had a constructive meeting with representatives of the Alzheimer Society on 29 August where these matters were discussed. <\/p>  <p>  In response to the rising number of people with dementia, currently estimated at 55,000, the Irish National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014 with the objective of increasing awareness, ensuring early diagnosis and intervention and developing enhanced community based services.  The Strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and to participate in those communities for far longer than many people appreciate.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with the Strategy, the Department of Health and the HSE agreed a joint initiative with the Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the Strategy over the period 2014-2017.  This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m. The Programme includes the provision of intensive home care packages for people with dementia, the upskilling of GPs and primary care teams in dementia diagnosis and management, and a public awareness and inclusion campaign. A National Dementia Office has been established to drive implementation of the Strategy in the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  I am happy to be able to confirm that my Department has recently secured funding of &euro;1.23 million under the 2017 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to support a number of dementia projects. These include post-diagnostic supports, dementia friendly communities, assistive technology libraries and further exploratory work on the development of a national dementia registry. These measures will help ensure that people with dementia can live well in their communities for as long as possible.<\/p>  <p>  An evaluation of the Dementia Advisers employed by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland has been commenced by the HSE. It would be appropriate to await the outcome of this evaluation before considering the appointment of additional advisers.<\/p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has undertaken a project to examine the role of Key Worker for people with dementia, a commitment outlined in the National Dementia Strategy. There are a number of potential models and approaches and the NDO is currently identifying these with a view to determining a suitable approach to this action under the Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond. The resources required for the ongoing implementation of the Strategy, including in relation to the role of key worker, can only be considered in the context of the Estimates and Budget process. The mid-term review will assist in identifying further actions required and will be helpful in the context of budgetary considerations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000079#WRQ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1059,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000079#WRQ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1060,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[42831\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000079#WRQ04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects the day care centre in Drogheda Street, Monasterevin, County Kildare, to be open; and the services that will be provided there.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1061,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000079#WRQ04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Speech and Language Therapy Provision","counter":1062,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000079#WRQ04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1063,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[42832\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000079#WRQ04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on the HSE's engagement with the introduction of a new in-school speech and language service.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1064,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits that a new in-school speech and language service will be established to support young children as part of a more integrated support system. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive undertook an extensive review of existing Speech and Language therapy provision earlier this year and the findings and recommendations of that review, which is based on best international practice will inform the development of a new model for delivery.<\/p>  <p>  It has been shown across the OECD as the most effective way of managing and intervening with the educational and social issues consequential to speech and language difficulties in children. <\/p>  <p>  Teachers and SLTs have different, but complementary, skills in developing children&rsquo;s language and learning.

This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners, and when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  These recommendations include examining the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  The programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.

The helpline streamlines and consolidates the good work in the area of animal welfare already carried out by Department Staff and associated agencies of the state as well as animal welfare organisations and the public as a whole.<\/p><p>For a direct comparison on the figures for 2017 to date, it may be helpful to note that my Department received 512 calls for the period Jan to September inclusive in 2016.<\/p><p>The line is Lo-call\u00a0 0761 064408 with a dedicated email address of <i>AnimalWelfare@agriculture.gov.ie<\/i>.\u00a0<\/p><p>The number of calls to the Animal Welfare Helpline for 2015 to 2016 and to date in 2017 are as follows:<table><tr><th>Year \u00a0<\/th><th>Number of calls<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>687 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>652<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017 to date<\/td><td>526<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000083#WRU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Slaughtering Data","counter":1317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000083#WRU02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1318,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[42560\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000083#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of horses slaughtered for human consumption in 2015 to 2016 and to date in 2017; the number of approved equine slaughter establishments in 2015 to 2016 and to date in 2017, by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1319,"content":"<p>There are currently two establishments approved by my Department to operate as equine slaughter plants under Regulation (EC) No 853\/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin on the hygiene of foodstuffs.<\/p><p>The plants are located in County Kilkenny and County Kildare.<\/p><p>The number of horses slaughtered for human consumption in 2015 to 2016 and to date in 2017 are\u00a0set out in the table below.<\/p><p>No. of equines slaughtered for human consumption \u00a02015\u00a0to\u00a0September 2017.<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>No.<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2015 <\/td><td>6033<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016 <\/td><td>7618<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017 to date<\/td><td>5837<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000083#WRU02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":1320,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000083#WRU02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1321,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[42561\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000083#WRU03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of prosecutions under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, in 2016 and to date in 2017; the number of prosecution files being processed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1322,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[42562\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000083#WRU03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of convictions under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, in each of the years 2014 to 2016 and to date in 2017, by district; the number of prosecution files being processed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1323,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 463 and 464 together.<\/p><p>The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 has changed the basis upon which animal owners must treat their animals and is specifically designed to allow early intervention in a much wider range of cases than the previous legislation allowed for.  Thus minor cases can be tackled before they escalate and the Act is a vehicle to encourage and educate animal keepers.  This new approach means that authorised officers are addressing problems while they are relatively minor, reducing the risk of escalation.<\/p><p>Enforcement is a complex issue, so a progressive aspect of the Act is that it does not just focus on prosecution, which is only appropriate in cases where there have been serious welfare issues that can be clearly demonstrated to the courts.  The new enforcement approach reflects the need to intervene as early as possible in animal welfare situations.  This approach is aided by The Early Warning\/Intervention System (EWS) initiative introduced by the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council involving, amongst others, my Department, the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which provides a framework within which farm animal welfare problems can be identified before they become critical or overwhelming.<\/p><p>The Act provides for animal health and welfare notices to be issued by authorised officers.  This means that minor situations can be addressed at an early stage and that encouragement, guidance and best practice are introduced rather than just punishment.  It also provides for fixed penalty notices to be issued in minor cases and allows authorised officers to seize and re-home animals where the owner&rsquo;s capacity to care for their animals is being overwhelmed.  Furthermore the Act contains provisions that where an individual convicted of serious animal welfare offences may be banned by the courts from keeping animals, or indeed have the numbers of animals they may keep restricted.<\/p><p>The provisions of the Act are enforced by authorised officers of my Department, An Garda Siochana, officers of Customs and Excise and authorised officers of ISPCA and DSPCA, along with individual officers of the Turf Club and Bord na gCon.  This approach provides a large cross section of experienced officials whom are aware of welfare issues and can flag them up as and when they arise.<\/p><p>The table sets out the position in respect of cases initiated and prosecuted for the years 2014-16.

The Beef Data and Genomics Programme is the main support for the suckler sector and provides farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over Rural Development Programme period. <\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0response to significant demand, earlier this year I reopened the BDGP programme for new entrants, reflecting the success of this programme, which targets both the environmental footprint and the profitability of the suckler herd through improving the genetic merit in participating herds.  There are currently\u00a025,669 participants.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of challenges facing the beef sector including the suckler sector in the short and medium term, particularly exchange rate volatility and Brexit.  One of my priorities now is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are an exporting nation, with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.\u00a0By further increasing our footprint internationally\u00a0we can make a contribution to\u00a0mitigating the effects of Brexit and develop our agri-food sector to realise its full potential.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Live exports also play a vital role in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers, including weanlings from the suckler herd at this time of year.

In tandem with opportunity, challenges such as volatility must be faced. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0period between mid-2014 through to Q4 2016 was extremely challenging for the dairy sector. Factors contributing to global price volatility in 2015 and 2016\u00a0included the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers including the EU on the supply side. <\/p>  <p>  While the outlook in 2017 has been more positive, there\u00a0are a number of factors which\u00a0continue to contribute to price volatility in the sector, including political factors outside our control.  Notwithstanding challenges on the horizon, amongst which Brexit is paramount, stakeholders in the Irish dairy sector are well placed to benefit from\u00a0expanding global demand.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of market returns to primary producers, raw milk prices remain in the region of 35 to 36 cents per litre\u00a0which is ahead of the EU average and over 50% ahead of where\u00a0prices were\u00a0this time last year.  Peak production months have passed in Ireland and by end September circa 80% plus of the average dairy farmer&rsquo;s annual production has been completed.  This combination of good prices and stronger supply means that 2017 can be expected to be a very good year for Irish dairy farmers in terms of market returns for their raw milk, which is welcome in the context of a very difficult 2016 in particular.<\/p>  <p>  I remain conscious of the pressure volatility in dairy markets can exert on farmers and\u00a0I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to utilising measures at our disposal, including EU market measures such as intervention, aids to private storage and exceptional market measures, as necessary.\u00a0 The legislative provisions underpinning these measures were finalised during the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2013. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have already outlined the measures taken to assist Irish\u00a0 farmers, including\u00a0 dairy farmers, \u00a0on a number of occasions.  These include\u00a0the launch of a &euro;150 million low-cost Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, increased funding under the Rural Development Programme, as well as the allocation of additional &euro;6.75 million to Bord Bia to provide supports to companies in terms of diversification of markets.  My Department continues to support and fund initiatives that help Irish farmers verify the high standards and quality of their production, including Origin Green and the Sustainable Dairy Assurance Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years dairy markets have been characterised by periods of both high and low prices and the challenge is to ensure that farmers have the tools available to manage their enterprises through the more difficult periods.  The industry itself has a critically important role to play and I welcome initiatives such as fixed price and margin contracts, which offer producers stability for a proportion of their supplies of milk going forward. In\u00a0our taxation policy, we have made it possible for farmers to average their income over a period of five years. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to carefully monitor market developments and engage with the EU Commission, with other member states and\u00a0with industry stakeholders to ensure that measures are in place to\u00a0help farmers through periods of uncertainty and volatility. <\/p>  <p>  I recently hosted the fifth meeting of the Dairy Forum with key stakeholders from the Irish dairy sector to discuss how best to future proof the sector by formulating a cohesive approach to dealing with ongoing challenges.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work closely with the dairy sector, with\u00a0EU colleagues and International counterparts to ensure the development and maintenance of a sustainable dairy sector in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000085#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Funding","counter":1438,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000085#WRW01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1439,"qnumday":503,"qnumall":"[42358\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000085#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to increase funding for TAMS and increase investment aid for commercial horticulture in budget 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1440,"content":"<p>The budget allocation for TAMS II for 2018 will be confirmed later today.<\/p><p>Under the TAMS II scheme, support is provided under a suite of seven measures:<\/p><p>- Young Farmers Capital \u00a0Investment Scheme;<\/p><p>- Dairy\u00a0Equipment Scheme;<\/p><p>- Organic Capital Investment Scheme;<\/p><p>- Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme;<\/p><p>- Low Emission Slurry Spreading;<\/p><p>- Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme;<\/p><p>- Tillage Capital Investment Scheme.<\/p><p>A wide range of investment items are available under each of these measures to help Irish farmers to improve their farms. <\/p><p>The\u00a0\u00a0scheme is co-funded by the National Exchequer and the EU's\u00a0European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development under Ireland's Rural Development Programme.

If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.<\/p>  <p>  However, notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I recognise the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  In that regard, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July 2016, I\u00a0established the Taskforce to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The December 2016 report of the Taskforce is available on my Department's website. <\/p>  <p>  The Taskforce worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders to produce the report which contains 40 actions to alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland.  To maintain momentum, I\u00a0established an Implementation Group to drive and monitor implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This Group will report on progress every 90 days and\u00a0has met twice this year, in March and July, with another meeting due to take place\u00a0in the coming weeks.  Two quarterly progress reports have been published so far, which\u00a0are available on my Department's website.  These demonstrate that good progress has been made in delivering the actions.  I am also pleased at the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry. <\/p>  <p>  This engagement was clearly demonstrated last Friday in Athlone where myself and Minister Kyne jointly hosted the first National Stakeholder Forum.\u00a0 This Forum arose out of a recognition by the Taskforce that, given the rapid pace of technology and the emergence of new equipment and solutions to deliver telecommunications services, it was critical that an opportunity be afforded to stakeholders to raise concerns on impediments to the rollout of services. \u00a0At last week&rsquo;s Forum, the opportunity was taken not only to discuss the issues impacting on such rollout, but also to suggest new recommended actions\u00a0to the Taskforce that will assist in providing improved services to consumers and in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.  The Forum will also inform the review to be conducted prior to completion of an annual report by the Implementation Group for\u00a0end 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg&rsquo;s announcement earlier this year of the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, will mean an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The award of 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band will provide stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The very significant commercial investment by mobile operators has resulted in improved services,\u00a0with\u00a0at least one operator now having in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000086#WRX00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Network","counter":1503,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000086#WRX00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1504,"qnumday":525,"qnumall":"[42234\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000086#WRX00600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on reports in the media (details supplied) which report 400 post office closures throughout the country; his plans regarding same; if an assurance can be given to postmasters on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1505,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[42337\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000086#WRX00700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the outstanding recommendations of the post office network business development group; the estimated cost of implementing all recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1506,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 525 and 528 together.  <\/p><p>I refer to the reply to Question No\u00a022 of 4 October and to the topical issues debate on post offices in the House on the same date.<\/p><p>It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and that it maintains a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.  However, the An Post Group lost &euro;13.7 million in 2016 with the core mails business losing over &euro;30m<font color=\"#1F497D\">.\u00a0<\/font>An Post has entered a period of structural change and decline in activity mainly due to the impact of e-substitution on mail volumes and post office transactions.\u00a0\u00a0This\u00a0has had a significant impact on the post office network and I understand that overall activity levels are down approximately 15% since 2013.  In addition annual payments\u00a0have reduced by up to 20% in some offices. \u00a0There is no doubt that the environment in which the post office operates is changing and the network needs to change to thrive, particularly with the move to digital transactions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I am responsible for the postal sector including the governance of An Post.\u00a0 Operational matters relating to the company&rsquo;s retail business, including the post office network, are matters for the Board and management of An Post.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate that there is concern regarding the potential closure of post offices and the potential number involved.\u00a0 This has been exacerbated by the media coverage on this issue over the past week.\u00a0 I would again reiterate that no definitive decision has been made by An Post regarding post office closures.  The post office plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike and this is at the forefront of An Post&rsquo;s mandate.  Government remains fully committed to\u00a0a sustainable\u00a0post office network which it sees as a key piece of economic and social infrastructure for both rural and urban.\u00a0<\/p><p>The fundamental review of the company is being undertaken\u00a0 to identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to put the company on a sound financial footing.  An\u00a0Post has recognised the realities of the current postal\u00a0environment and is transforming how it does business to be a better fit for the future of e-commerce where the average spend per consumer in Ireland is forecast to nearly double in the next five years.\u00a0\u00a0It is imperative that the network be restructured into a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates.  Inevitably, the scale of the envisaged change will impact on individual postmasters and some postmasters, who have given long and dedicated service to their local communities and to An Post, may find it a challenge to adopt to a very significant renewal programme.\u00a0 Any changes in this area will have to be the subject of negotiation between An Post and the postmasters.\u00a0 I continue to encourage An Post to continue to work closely with all parties to find an agreed solution to the renewal of the network.<\/p><p>I\u00a0have met the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union\u00a0and\u00a0was interested to hear their perspective on how to renew what continues to be a very valuable resource for both urban and rural communities.<\/p><p>Until such time as the review is finalised and assessed it is not be possible to comment further.

The SEAI estimates that less than 5% of transport emissions came from the public transport fleet in 2015 (buses, rail and taxis).  It is reliance on private car travel that represents the most considerable challenge, producing\u00a0over 50% of overall transport emissions. <\/p>  <p>  Moving to a low carbon society represents a significant challenge for Ireland&rsquo;s expanding transport sector where the use of fossil fuels and individual travel patterns are firmly established.  Decarbonising transport will require a significant step-change in how we travel, how we do business and the types of fuels and technologies we employ. <\/p>  <p>  To date, a number of successful measures have already been introduced to reduce transport sector emissions including: sustained investment in the public and sustainable transport network to increase capacity and promote modal shift; implementation of EU regulations limiting tail pipe emissions; redesigning the Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and motor tax regimes to promote low carbon emitting vehicles; incentives to encourage alternative fuel and technologies; and the introduction of a Biofuel Obligation Scheme.  Furthermore, under the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government a dedicated Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce was established to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the uptake of alternatively powered vehicles. <\/p>  <p>  The transport sector must and will continue to play a strong role in contributing to our national emissions reduction effort.  Ireland's\u00a0welcome return to economic growth has brought with it an increase in transport demand and, without intervention, transport emissions will unquestionably continue to rise.  The transport sector is faced with the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions without hindering social improvement or financial recovery.<\/p>  <p>  To decarbonise\u00a0transport\u00a0a diverse range of measures is required, key among them being\u00a0increasing public transport capacity, promoting sustainable travel and modal shift, and encouraging the uptake and deployment of cleaner alternative fuels and technologies.

To this end I am currently engaged with my Government colleagues with a view to securing additional investment for the childcare sector in Budget 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Although it is my intention to continue to pursue further increases in investment in the childcare sector going forward, it would be premature at this juncture to speculate as to what fiscal space might be available in the budgetary years 2019-2022 to secure this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000089#WRAA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Affordable Childcare Scheme","counter":1740,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000089#WRAA03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1741,"qnumday":609,"qnumall":"[42677\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000089#WRAA03300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the removal of the 15-hour standard hours subsidy proposal from the development of the affordable childcare scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1742,"content":"<p>There are no plans in place to remove the proposed 15 hour standard hours subsidy from the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  I want to ensure a balanced approach to eligibility for childcare subsidies under the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  While a family&rsquo;s income will determine the amount of subsidy the family will qualify for, the parents&rsquo; participation in work or training will determine the number of hours of subsidy available.  When parents are engaged in work (including part-time work and labour market activation programmes) or in education or training, they will be eligible for an enhanced subsidy of up to 40 hours per week.  When parents are not in work or training, childcare will be subsidised on a standard basis of up to 15 hours per week.  I believe that this is a reasonable approach that reflects a balance of the labour market and child development objectives that will underpin the new scheme.<\/p>  <p>  It will mean that this Scheme is open &ndash; albeit for standard hours rather than enhanced hours &ndash; to parents who are not taking part in work or training, but who choose to avail of up to 15 hours of childcare per week.

The Committee had an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services.  In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.  The Committee had its final meeting on 26 November 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. <\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published in, 2015.  The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy.  There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross-sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures.  At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF.  At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees.  Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework. <\/p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed.  These include the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant.  I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is fully committed to the reform of the many youth funding schemes.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of targeted funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead.  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review.  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has commenced a review of the Youth Service Grant Scheme.  This review is intended to enhance its accountability, transparency and outcome measurement.  It is also seeking to determine how best to meet the ever evolving needs of young people. <\/p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people. <\/p>  <p>  For the above reasons, it is not my intention to reconvene the National Youth Work Advisory Committee while the reform process is ongoing.  Given the seismic changes which have occurred over the past sixteen years, my Department will be revisiting the Youth Work Act, 2001 on the conclusion of the reform process, to ensure that it fully articulates the needs of young people in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000089#WRAA05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services","counter":1765,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000089#WRAA05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1766,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[42882\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000089#WRAA05800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of ETBs that have an integrated youth services programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1767,"content":"<p>Tusla has advised that a total of 41 School Completion Programme staff are employed directly by Education and Training Boards.

The additional funding is being used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I approved the launch of an updated and improved Local Youth Club Grant Scheme and from 2017, the scheme incorporated the National Quality Standards for volunteer led youth groups.

The Programme was rolled out in April 2015, and will run until 31 December 2017. Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders.  The SICAP funding allocation, for front-line delivery, for 2017, is &euro;37.5m, which includes an allocation of &euro;3m under the European Social Fund (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020. <\/p>  <p>  SICAP is a key intervention for the harder to reach, with delivery in each area (or Lot) overseen and managed by the relevant Local Community Development Committee (LCDC) in each local authority area.  The programme is currently delivered in a total of 51 Lots, and it targets both rural and urban areas.  The number and configuration of the Lots was decided upon by the LCDCs, based on their considerable knowledge of their local areas.<\/p>  <p>  LCDCs bring a more joined-up and coherent approach to the local management of publicly funded programmes in the areas of economic, social and community development, including SICAP, through the development and implementation of the community elements of the Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP). It is for the LCDCs to target and plan their strategy in accordance with local need and the contents of their LECP.  Whilst complying with the programme&rsquo;s aims, objectives and requirements, Programme Implementers are expected to ensure that actions set out under SICAP reflect the priorities and needs identified in the community aspect of the LECP, which emerged from extensive local consultation processes.<\/p>  <p>  The next iteration of the programme, SICAP 2018-2022 is due to supersede the current programme with effect from 1 January 2018.  The programme has been refined to allow LCDC&rsquo;s to include their own &lsquo;emerging needs&rsquo; group to more efficiently target supports within their Lot area.  As with the current programme and in accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP 2018-2022 is subject to a public procurement process which is currently underway.  The national procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.  The process is managed within each Lot area by the relevant LCDC.  The process is the same for every County.  Given the deliberative process, currently underway, I am not in a position to comment further. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000090#WRBB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Improvement Scheme Funding","counter":1809,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000090#WRBB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1810,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[42922\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000090#WRBB03900","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the reason the local improvement scheme allocation to Tipperary County Council was smaller and in some cases half of what was allocated to other smaller counties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":1811,"content":"<p>On 21st September, I announced the provision of &euro;10 million\u00a0for a Local Improvement Scheme.\u00a0 This is a nation-wide scheme which supports improvement works on private and non-public roads. <\/p>  <p>  My Department wrote to Local Authorities in August to establish the level of demand for an LIS scheme this year.

The scope of the review included the long-term age-related policy changes to the scheme that were implemented since January 2012, in addition to the shorter term changes required to achieve savings across all social welfare expenditure over the same period on foot of the economic downturn. <\/p><p>In order to complete the review, Indecon carried out a detailed quantitative and econometric analysis of a number of relevant datasets to assess the impact of the changes on lone parents.  The review also included one of the largest surveys targeting one-parent families in Ireland, with 33,000 lone parents surveyed.Responses were received and analysed from almost 3,700 lone parents who were directly affected by the changes.  This provided an excellent opportunity to gather the views and experiences of lone parents affected by the changes. <\/p><p>I have received the review  and  I laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas on Monday 9thOctober 2017, as provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 2016.  I welcome a number of positive findings in the Review: <\/p><p>-The policy changes introduced have been successful in increasing employment and in reducing welfare dependency &ndash; the reforms increased the probability of both employment and of higher employment income. <\/p><p>-Responses to the survey showed that the percentage of lone parents in full-time employment increased from 15% to 22%. <\/p><p>-Welfare dependency rates fell in the year after One-parent Family Payment was lost, and continued to fall in subsequent years. <\/p><p>I believe that these findings indicate that the broad policy intentions of the changes are having positive results and making real changes to the lives of lone parents, where they have been able to transition into employment. <\/p><p>I acknowledge, however, that the review has also raised a number of matters of concern: <\/p><p>-Many of those who lost the One-parent Family Payment remain unemployed, or are in low paid or part-time employment, <\/p><p>-The balance of evidence indicates that there is an increased probability of being at risk of poverty as a result of the changes, <\/p><p>-Further supports, aimed at assisting lone parents to obtain full-time employment or increased hours of work, need to be put in place. <\/p><p>The impacts on lone parents arose from the combination of the policy changes to the scheme, and from the imposition, simultaneously, of the financial cuts imposed to welfare schemes across the board, arising out of the economic downturn.  I, and my predecessors, have already taken action in recent Budgets to improve the position of lone parents, for example by progressively increasing the income disregard for those on Jobseekers Transition (JST) from a low of &euro;60 a week to &euro;110 euro a week, and by targeting improved, tailored activation measures towards this group, to assist them into training and employment. <\/p><p>For example lone parents who wish to participate in education can continue to receive support from the Department either through the retention of their primary payment or Family Income Supplement or they can transfer to the Back to Education Allowance. Furthermore, to support lone parents participate in education, SUSI grants (both maintenance and fee grants) are payable concurrently with One-parent Family Payment and Jobseekers Transition.  Therefore a lone parent can participate in education and receive the dual support of the One-parent Family Payment\/ Jobseekers Transition and the SUSI maintenance grants. <\/p><p>Where the lone parent is on Jobseekers Allowance they can, should they wish to, participate in education, transfer to the Back to Education programme.  The additional childcare supports coming on-stream are also of particular benefit to lone parents. <\/p><p>I consider that these measures are a step in the right direction, and I am working to ensure that there is no loss in the momentum to enhance the support for lone parents.  The Review points to the need to intensify both the engagement with lone parents as they move off One-parent Family Payment, and the activation supports available, and I am requesting my officials to prioritise this. <\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s employment services provide a case-managed approach to assist lone parents to avail of various opportunities within an ever-improving labour market.  This case-managed approach will be developed further, specifically to offer more tailored and holistic progression plans for lone parents, that better reflect their individual circumstances. <\/p><p>The move to more tailored progressions plans for lone parents will incorporate supports to access the childcare, education and training and other appropriate supports that they require to, in turn, access the labour market.  These changes should help to improve the living standards of, and reduce the risk of poverty faced by, lone parents. <\/p><p>I intend to continue to prioritise supports for lone parents, particularly those which incentivise work over welfare.  I intend also to provide for the further review of the scheme.  As there is a time lag before the benefits of labour market reforms appear I anticipate that this review will include data to the end of 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homemakers Scheme","counter":1870,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1871,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[42532\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of backdating the homemaker's scheme to 1970 in incremental steps of five years from 1994; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1872,"content":"<p>To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension contributory easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.<\/p>  <p>  While the Deputy has requested the estimated cost of backdating the homemaker scheme to 1970 in incremental steps of five years from 1994, there are a number of factors that make it difficult to estimate that cost for specific year bands.  In the first instance, it should be noted that there are twenty methods by which someone can qualify for a contributory pension depending upon their PRSI record, and so the impact of incremental changes to the Homemakers scheme is not possible to estimate without doing an analysis of the actual contribution records of potential claimant groups.  <\/p>  <p>  There are further data-related issues which make it even more challenging.  For example, much of the data (e.g., child benefit records) used in the operation of the scheme at present for periods from 1994, is not readily available in computerised form for periods prior to 1984.  Any projection, therefore, has to make assumptions regarding the composition of gaps in contribution records.<\/p>  <p>  Costing multiple partial backdatings over a range of years would require very detailed analysis of the distribution of gaps in individual records during particular periods, an estimation of which gaps were driven by child rearing and which are a result of alternative reasons, and then re-calculation of those individual entitlements under the various qualification rules.  <\/p>  <p>  While no analysis of the particular proposal contained in the Deputy&rsquo;s question has been conducted, it is clear that any backdating would entail a significant and ongoing cost to the Social Insurance Fund.  It is estimated that backdating it in respect of periods before its introduction in 1994 would cost some &euro;290 million per year, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the overall rise in the cost of State pensions.  Limiting that backdating to 1970 would moderate that cost somewhat.  However, it is unlikely to have a significant impact as the bulk of the cost would likely arise in the years immediately prior to 1994 and would decrease the further back the backdating was taken.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension non-contributory, which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a Total Contributions Approach.  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the total number of contributions made by people, not when they paid them.  The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing this new system of calculating the State Pension (contributory).<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that this approach to pension qualification will replace the current one from 2020. Following publication of the current actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, a refined proposal will be developed.  My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders, including interest groups, representative bodies and the Oireachtas.  Following the consultation period, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval for the new approach, and then proceed to introduce legislation to give effect to this reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory)","counter":1873,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC03500"},{"type":"question","counter":1874,"qnumday":655,"qnumall":"[42533\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC03600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of reversing changes made to the eligibility criteria for the State pension (contributory) in 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1875,"content":"<p>As a result of more people living to pension age and living longer in retirement the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision.  This demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year &ndash; not including the impact of rate increases.    The current rate bands applying to the SPC were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  These rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012. <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of over &euro;60 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million each following year (e.g. it would be expected to cost some &euro;70 million in 2019).  This estimate reflects the numbers of those in receipt of reduced rate SPC payments, and does not include those who are claiming an alternative payment at a higher rate than their reduced SPC entitlement, and who might qualify for a higher rate of SPC if such a change were introduced.  This estimate also assumes that any such change to rate bands would generally be implemented from a current date and as a result would not generate retrospective arrears. <\/p>  <p>  The main beneficiaries from such a decision would be younger (post September 2012) pensioners who both:<\/p>  <p>  a. haven&rsquo;t sufficient paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund to qualify for a contributory pension at the maximum rate, or for the 98% rate applying to those with a yearly average of 40-47 weekly PRSI contributions paid or credited per year, and <\/p>  <p>  b. do not qualify for means-tested pension payments at the maximum rate because, in addition to their state pension, they also have means above a certain level (e.g. they are in receipt of an occupational pension and\/or own a second residential property). <\/p>  <p>  The savings created by the new rate bands were an alternative to cutting the core rate of pensions, at a time when Exchequer savings were required, and other social protection payments were being reduced across the board.  Had a similar approach been taken with pensions, affecting everyone over State pension age &ndash; regardless of their means and their contribution record &ndash; the hardest hit would have been pensioners with no additional incomes, notably those paid a State pension (non-contributory), and widows and widowers living alone on only one pension payment.  A very significantly higher proportion of such pensioners are women, and this approach would have been expected to result in more women over 65 experiencing consistent poverty, relative to men of the same age.  The most recent CSO statistics show that this negative outcome has been avoided. <\/p>  <p>  The alternative approach, taken by the Government at that time, made savings in respect of the State pension (contributory) by making rates of payment for new pensioners more reflective of contribution history, while maintaining the rates of payment for non-contributory and Widows\/widowers pensions, as well as for contributory pensions paid to those who had contributed into the Social Insurance Fund throughout their working lives (i.e. with a yearly average of 40 or more).  This approach safeguarded those most vulnerable pensioners, whilst avoiding undermining the contributory system, which is the basis for collection of PRSI, which funds the SPC on a &lsquo;Pay-As-You-Go&rsquo; basis. <\/p>  <p>  Where people do not qualify for a maximum-rate contributory pension in their own right, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Where their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them, and is subject to a personal means-test.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.    In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, and where a person is available for work, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age. <\/p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension. <\/p>  <p>  However, it is estimated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to rise to &euro;87 million by 2020.  These figures do not include future rate increases.  Reversing this decision would, therefore, significantly increase the annual cost of State pensions, and would reduce the funds available to pay for any future increases in the rates of the payment. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no statutory retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may originally have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so. <\/p>  <p>  In January 2016, an Interdepartmental Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established specifically to examine the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages.  The final report of the Group made a number of recommendations to support working and retirement practices.  This included a request to the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to help manage the engagement between employers and employees regarding retirement issues and longer working.  The final report, the recommendations of which were accepted by Government in August 2016, is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Reform","counter":1879,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1880,"qnumday":657,"qnumall":"[42535\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the steps which have been taken by her Department to date in establishing an auto enrolment pension system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1881,"content":"<p><b><\/b>Pensions reform is a priority for my term as Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and I can confirm the Government&rsquo;s intention to publish and commence the implementation of a pensions reform plan in the coming months.  Perhaps the most fundamental reform measure which will be contained within this plan will relate to the development of a new auto enrolment supplementary retirement savings system for employees without pensions coverage.The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is 47% of the working population and this reduces to 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Whilst the State pension provides a reasonable basic level of income and guards against poverty in retirement, if measures are not taken to address this low rate of supplementary coverage, many future retirees will experience unwanted reductions in living standards when they reach retirement. <\/p><p>Auto enrolment will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary supplementary pension system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  This reform, where the saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out, will encourage long term saving and asset accumulation amongst those who may otherwise suffer a reduction in living standards at retirement.  It will increase the well-being, financial security and independence of future retirees. <\/p><p>Preliminary work has been undertaken by officials in my Department to begin to identify the most effective, deliverable and sustainable automatic enrolment model.  Previously, an Interdepartmental &lsquo;Universal Retirement Savings Group&rsquo; (URSG) considered the issue and concluded that building reform consensus across political, business and civil society is essential for any new system.  To this end, the URSG held initial consultations with citizens, employer representatives, trade unions, the pensions industry, advocacy and interest groups, as well as Irish and international experts. <\/p><p>A review of international automatic enrolment retirement systems by my officials has confirmed that success is dependent on well tested design principles and securing member trust.  To this end, further detailed evidence building and consultation will be undertaken to inform fundamental choices which are required regarding the preferred operational structure and organisational governance for a new system as well as many design elements such as contribution levels, financial incentives and target membership.  Correctly positioning\/designing each of these will be critical to the success of any system.  <\/p><p>Subject to any Government decision regarding the manner in which this project should be progressed, it is my objective that first members would be enrolled in the new system in 2021.  This project timeframe reflects the scale of such a programme and its importance as being the most fundamental reform of the Irish supplementary pension system in generations. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reviews","counter":1882,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1883,"qnumday":658,"qnumall":"[42536\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number and subject matter of reports and reviews that have been commissioned by her Department and are currently under way, in tabular form; if an outside body has been commissioned to conduct the report and or review; the expected publication dates; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1884,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is currently being compiled by my officials and will be provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Administration","counter":1885,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04700"},{"type":"question","counter":1886,"qnumday":659,"qnumall":"[42537\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of households in receipt of rent supplement by county, in tabular form; the number of households in each county that have had their rent supplement increased above the prescribed limits; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1887,"qnumday":678,"qnumall":"[42839\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC04900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the annualised cost of the average monthly rent currently paid to rent supplement recipients under the scheme; the number of families availing of the scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1338"},{"type":"question","counter":1888,"qnumday":691,"qnumall":"[42996\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000091#WRCC05000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a mechanism whereby persons who are awaiting the outcome of their HAP application with their local authority can be permitted to apply for and be paid rent allowance or SWA in the interim will be approved in view of the length of time it is taking for these applications to be processed.","asker":"1278","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1889,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 659, 678 and 691 together.<\/p><p>The rent supplement scheme, administered by my Department, plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting in excess of 37,460 recipients for which the Government has provided &euro;253 million for in 2017.  A county breakdown of rent supplements recipients as at end September 2017 is provided in the attached tabular statement. <\/p><p>The full annualised costs for the existing customer base at current blended rent supplement tenancy rates of &euro;480 per month, is approximately &euro;220 million. <\/p><p>In recognition of the on-going rental market difficulties, my Department continues to implement a targeted case-by-case policy approach in the administration of rent supplement that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent limits.  In addition, the Protocol arrangement in place with Threshold continues to operate in the areas where supply issues are particularly acute covering Dublin, Cork, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow and Galway City.  To date in 2017, in excess of 1,450 recipients have been supported with increased rent payments.A county breakdown of these payments is provided in the attached tabular statement. <\/p><p>As the Deputies will be aware the strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support, with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, available nationwide from 1 March 2017.  There are currently c. 27,600 HAP tenancies in place of which c. 8,200 (c. 30%) are transfers from rent supplement.  In addition to the ongoing transfer of long-term rent supplement recipients to HAP, the majority of new applicants seeking State support towards their rent are supported by Local Authorities through HAP rather than rent supplement. <\/p><p>Rent supplement is not an interim or ancillary payment while a HAP application is being processed.  However, rent supplement will continue to be paid to households who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require a short term income support to pay their rent. <\/p><p>Officials in my Department continue to work closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and local authorities to facilitate the ongoing implementation of the HAP scheme including the transfer of cases from Rent Supplement.

People who have made significant contributions into the Fund are more likely to receive their pension under that scheme than under other pensions.   <\/p>  <p>  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.   <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or caring for incapacitated people over that age, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory) also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of pensioners who qualify for that scheme, which is used to set the rate of his or her pension.   <\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  The large majority of both of these payments are made at the maximum rate.<\/p>  <p>  Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a Total Contributions Approach which it is hoped will replace the current one from 2020.  Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the total number of contributions made by people, not when they paid them.  The position of homemakers is being carefully considered in developing this new system.  Following publication of the current actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, a refined proposal will be developed.  My Department will conduct a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders on possible approaches.  Following that process, I will submit a proposal to Government seeking approval for the selected approach, and then proceed to introduce legislation to give effect to this reform.   <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000092#WRDD03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":1945,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000092#WRDD03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1946,"qnumday":680,"qnumall":"[42850\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000092#WRDD03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the position in respect of public services cards for those claiming a social welfare payment; the number of persons that have been refused payment as a result of not having a card; the payments concerned and the legal basis for such refusal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1947,"content":"<p>In 2005, the Government approved a rules-based standard for establishing and authenticating an individual&rsquo;s identity for the purposes of access to public services.

Accordingly, the relevant IB has responsibility for the day-to-day operation of each scheme including the recruitment of eligible participants.  <\/p>  <p>  At this point, all of the IBs have plans in place to fully utilise the places available to them and, therefore, there are no plans at present for the re-distribution of unfilled places.  However, my Department will keep the position under review.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000092#WRDD06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Leave","counter":1975,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000092#WRDD06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1976,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[42984\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000092#WRDD06300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the details of the recent Government announcement to extend maternity leave to mothers that have a premature baby; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1977,"content":"<p>Maternity Benefit is a payment made for 26 weeks to employed and self-employed pregnant women who satisfy certain pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions in order to avoid the need for them to work pre and post-delivery of their baby.

The most recent scientific studies carried out on a diverse range of farm and soil types as part of Teagasc&rsquo;s on-going Agricultural Catchments Programme has provided further evidence in support of the efficacy of the current closed periods in reducing nutrient losses to waters.  A key message from the research is that there are disproportionately high nutrient losses to waters during the winter and the current closed period coincides with the time during which risks of incidental nutrient losses to water are highest.  Farmers are advised to spread slurry early in the season when growth and nutrient uptake are at their peak.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have been closely monitoring the situation and have\u00a0recognised that there may be some potential concerns for animal welfare arising from heavy rainfall in specific parts of the country (the north west in particular).  Farmers with such concerns are advised to contact the Nitrates Section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at (053) 9163444 or by email to nitrates@agriculture.gov.ie with details of the flooding and\/or trafficability situation, their herd number and other relevant data.  Such contact should be made by Saturday 14 October at the latest.<\/p>  <p>  Farmers wishing to avail of such flexibility will be advised:<\/p>  <p>  1. To spread only that volume of slurry necessary to ensure adequate storage capacity for the remainder of the closed period<\/p>  <p>  2. That any spreading should occur as soon as good spreading conditions exist<\/p>  <p>  3. That they will be prioritised for inspection by Local Authorities in the immediate future to ensure compliance with the Nitrates Regulations<\/p>  <p>  4. That assessment of overall on-farm storage capacity may be part of that inspection process<\/p>  <p>  5. That the\u00a0Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will subsequently contact the farmers to ascertain and record the date(s) on which this additional spreading takes place.<\/p>  <p>  Local Authority inspection reports will be returned to my Department and will be\u00a0shared with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and those farms needing to avail of this flexibility will become a priority category for inspections in future years also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000093#WREE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Refunds","counter":2021,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000093#WREE04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2022,"qnumday":706,"qnumall":"[42720\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000093#WREE04200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will assess a proposal (details supplied) to assist the not-for-profit sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2023,"content":"<p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services recommended adherence to the principle of equity of treatment for those who have paid and have not paid their water charges since domestic charges were introduced.

This will commence by the end of 2017. <\/p><p>I did not meet with the Representative Associations in September, but I intend to meet them in the coming weeks to further discuss the issues raised in the climate survey. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000095#WRGG02550","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Representative Organisations","counter":2147,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000095#WRGG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":2148,"qnumday":754,"qnumall":"[42268\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000095#WRGG02700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he has responded to requests from RACO in 2016 and 2017 to review both the national level industrial relations structures of the Defence Forces representation and internal Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":2149,"qnumday":755,"qnumall":"[42269\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101000095#WRGG02800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his plans to align equivalent industrial relations structures of the Defence Forces with changes planned for the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na associations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":2150,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 754 and 755 together.<\/p><p>I can advise the Deputy, as I announced recently, that I intend to initiate a review of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.
