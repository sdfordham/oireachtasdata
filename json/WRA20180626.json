The remaining 700 Mandays are allocated to provide for Reserve Defence Force Representative Association (RDFRA) business. <\/p>  <p>  While the minimum provision of paid training days is 7, members of the Reserve may avail of additional paid training days, up to a total of 28 days, in the context of career courses, specialist and other additional training. <\/p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the voluntary nature of Reserve Service, training continues to be organised both in and out of normal working hours and at weekends. Reserve training is also organised during academic and traditional holiday periods, in order to maximise attendance of Reserve personnel. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600058#WRB05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":107,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 79 to 81, inclusive, answered with Question No. 71.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600059#WRC00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Enlargement","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600059#WRC00300"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[28040\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600059#WRC00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he continues to pursue and advance the cause of the Western Balkans in the context of EU enlargement, having particular regard to the sensitivities of the region and its geopolitical importance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>Ireland is a strong supporter of EU enlargement.  We believe it is a transformative driver for stability and peace, and that it will enhance stability and economic growth in the Western Balkans while also shoring up security on the borders of Europe.  It is our strong view that providing the countries of the Western Balkans with a credible membership perspective is essential.  Both the Taoiseach and Minister McEntee made this point when attending the EU-Western Balkans Summit on 17 May, during which they were able to productively engage with our EU and Western Balkan counterparts.  I had the honour to host my Albanian counterpart in Dublin on the eve of the summit.<\/p>  <p>  The General Affairs Council is meeting today in Luxembourg and is looking at the opening of accession negotiations with both Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Ireland is a strong supporter of opening negotiations, as we feel that while considerable efforts need to be made in certain areas, both countries had made sufficient progress to warrant opening and that such a step was important in order to provide momentum to the enlargement process.  We also believe that FYROM deserves praise for the considerable political courage it has shown in reaching the historic agreement with Greece in regard to the name issue.<\/p>  <p>  Concerning Serbia and Montenegro, Ireland shares the view of the EU that the 2025 date given in the Commission&rsquo;s Western Balkans Strategy represents an indicative &ndash; and ambitious &ndash; perspective to conclude the accession process for Serbia and Montenegro, rather than a deadline or target. We believe that setting an indicative date provides Montenegro and Serbia with a concrete EU perspective that should reinforce the reform process in those countries. We have also been very clear that all benchmarks and criteria must be met before accession can be agreed.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ireland is a strong supporter of Bosnia&rsquo;s European perspective but we recognise that significant work will have to be done across multiple areas before it can advance on its European path.  Progress has been made and we hope that this progress gathers momentum and is supplemented by practical efforts to ensure real reform.<\/p>  <p>  On Kosovo, Ireland was one of the first countries to recognise Kosovo&rsquo;s independence, and we were represented at the celebrations of Kosovo&rsquo;s 10th anniversary of independence in February this year.  As a supporter of enlargement, we fully support Kosovo&rsquo;s joining the EU, provided that it meets all the relevant requirements, which include a normalisation of relations with Serbia.  It is Ireland&rsquo;s hope that a normalisation of relations with Serbia, resulting in a bilateral agreement that is mutually acceptable to both sides, will lead to Kosovo&rsquo;s eventually joining the EU with the unanimous consent of all Member States.  Of course, all of the other requirements for accession would also need to be met in full.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600059#WRC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600059#WRC00600"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[27412\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600059#WRC00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the criteria for applying for a first-time passport for a child (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>All passport applications are subject to the provisions of the Passports act, 2008 (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;).

It seems clear from reports we have received that significant challenges persist regarding Honduran citizens&rsquo; enjoyment of basic human rights.

I would also call for those responsible for such violence to be brought to justice.

Over 500,000 applications have been received so far this year. Applications received in the first 5 months of this year have increased by over 8% compared with the same time period last year.The Passport Service offers a variety of channels through which citizens can apply for a passport and the choice of channel determines the turnaround period of applications. The quickest and easiest way for an adult to renew a passport is to apply online.  Over 50% of the 100,000 applicants who have used this channel this year, have got their passport back within a week and all have the passport issued within the advertised 2 week timeframe.The largest proportion of applications, almost 50%, are still made via the Passport Express channel.  Adult and children renewals are given a target turnaround time of 15 working days and this timeframe is being met.  First time applicants, and those with lost or stolen passport are taking longer.  These applications require additional security measures including robust identity verification and entitlement checking, and as a result, take longer to process.  In cases where other family member have submitted renewal applications alongside the first time application, all applications are linked in the system and can only be dealt with once the necessary checks have been completed on the first time application.<\/p><p>The Passport Service monitors the volume of applications on an ongoing basis to ensure that resources are available to meet demand.In order to respond to anticipated application increases and to seasonal demands, the Passport Service received sanction for 220 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) this year to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork. These TCOs are working together with permanent staff to process passport applications and to deal with the high number of enquiries being made through the Passport Service&rsquo;s various customer service channels.  <\/p><p>The number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) staff permanently employed by my Department and assigned to the Passport Service stood at 322 at the beginning of the year. This compares to 301 FTE staff assigned to the Passport Service at the same point last year. This year, since these figures were released, over 30 additional permanent staff have started with the Passport Service. <\/p><p>The Passport Service is doing everything possible to ensure that passports are processed as quickly as possible. In addition to the intake of TCOs and use of targeted overtime, experienced staff from across the Department have been re-deployed to processing applications and respond to customer queries.<\/p><p>The high number of queries being received from applicants is in line with the increasing volume of applications being received. The Passport Service makes every effort to respond to as many queries as possible. In the week of June 11 the Passport Services dealt with over 9,500 of these queries. In recent weeks the Passport Service has allocated additional resources to the existing Communications Unit to respond to customer queries on phones, email and webchat. Measures taken include the temporary redeployment of existing Department staff and the assignment of temporary clerical officers to the communications unit. <\/p><p>Many queries received by the communications unit can be answered with information readily available on the Passport Service&rsquo;s website <i>www.DFA.ie\/passport<\/i>.  Detailed and regularly updated information on passport services; current average turnaround times and comprehensive guides to the various application processes can be consulted here. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that applicants can track the status of existing applications at any time through the Passport Service&rsquo;s online tracker which can also be found on the Passport Service&rsquo;s website.

This standard emphasises, amongst other things, the ceiling clearance level of the patient compartment which gives sufficient space for the treatment of the casualty during transport.

IAASA is under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. <\/p><p>Under the Companies Act 2014, the Transparency Regulations and the Audit Regulations, IAASA has seven primary functions: <\/p><p>- Supervision of how the Prescribed Accountancy Bodies (PABs) regulate and monitor their members;<\/p><p>- Monitoring of the periodic financial reporting of certain entities whose securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market in the EU;<\/p><p>- Carrying out certain functions in respect of liquidators;<\/p><p>- Promotion of adherence to high professional standards in the auditing and accountancy profession;<\/p><p>- Acting as a specialist source of advice to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on auditing and accounting matters;<\/p><p>- External quality assurance of the auditors of listed companies, credit institutions and insurance undertakings to ensure a high quality of audit; and <\/p><p>- Adoption and maintenance of the audit framework for Ireland.<\/p><p>Further information on IAASA can be found on its website:  <i>https:\/\/www.iaasa.ie\/About-IAASA\/Our-Role<\/i><\/p><p>The EU completed a significant reform of the rules governing statutory audit with the adoption of two new instruments in April 2014.\u00a0 The resulting EU Directive and EU Regulation on Audits update existing EU law on statutory audits.\u00a0 S.I. 312 of 2016 transposed the EU Audit Directive and gave effect to some provisions of the EU Regulation, was signed into law on 15 June 2016. <\/p><p>The following are the main areas of impact &ndash; <\/p><p>- The framework for public oversight was enhanced and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) is now the single competent authority with ultimate responsibility for oversight of statutory auditors and audit firms and has direct responsibility for oversight of audits of public interest entities (credit institutions, insurers, and listed entities). The recognised accountancy bodies still retain responsibility for certain oversight tasks such as approval and continuing education of auditors and inspections of non-public interest entity audits.<\/p><p>- The obligations on statutory auditors to be independent when auditing the financial statements of their clients were strengthened and in particular limits placed on the type and amount of non-audit services an auditor may provide.<\/p><p>- New obligations on public interest entities with respect to the appointment of and interaction with their auditors were introduced, most significantly the requirement to change auditor at least every ten years.<\/p><p>- The Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017 avails of options not available in secondary legislation which will enhance the system of oversight of audit in Ireland and audit quality. It elevates the provisions of S.I. No. 312 of 2016 into primary legislation to provide a single, comprehensive framework for statutory audit in the Companies Act 2014. It gives IAASA, as the competent authority with ultimate responsibility for oversight, enhanced powers for monitoring and enforcement of the new requirements.<\/p><p>The Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017\u00a0passed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 21 February 2018. D&aacute;il Report Stage is expected to take place mid-July. The Bill has yet to pass through the Seanad but it is intended that it be enacted as soon as possible. <\/p><p>The above matters are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and any further queries on any should be directed to her. <\/p><p>Further\u00a0to the above legislation governing auditors, there are additional requirements for  the auditors of Regulated Financial Service Providers (RFSPs)\u00a0imposed by the Central Bank of Ireland. These include the Auditor Protocol and a number of reporting requirements, which are detailed below. <\/p><p>The Protocol between the Central Bank of Ireland and the Auditors of Regulated Financial Service Providers: <\/p><p>- The Auditor Protocol was first developed and published in 2011 and applied to those firms which were rated High Impact under the Central Bank&rsquo;s then new regulatory risk model, Probability Risk Impact System (&ldquo;PRISM&rdquo;). Institutions are categorised based on the greatest impact on financial stability and the consumer as follows, High Impact, Medium-High Impact, Medium-Low Impact and Low Impact<\/p><p>- Following a review in 2013 the scope of the Auditor Protocol was extended to include all meetings held between external auditors and the Central Bank including meetings held in respect of supervisory tasks relating to medium high and medium low impact firms.<\/p><p>- For High Impact firms it is expected that there will be at least two formal bilateral meetings per year. These meetings will take place at the pre audit stage and the post audit stage.<\/p><p>- For non-High Impact firms the frequency of meetings will be determined by the impact category of the firm under the PRISM engagement model.<\/p><p>- The Central Bank, through its Corporate Governance requirements, places a significant onus on the Audit Committee to monitor the effectiveness and adequacy of the firm&rsquo;s internal control (including around IT systems) and internal audit. It is because of this reliance that the Central Bank believes that trilateral meetings should take place between the Central Bank, the auditor and the Chair of the Audit Committee or, if an Audit Committee is not in place, an appropriate Independent Non-Executive Director, to discuss areas of concern and\/or mutual interest regarding the firm. The Trilateral Meeting will, in the normal course of audits, be conducted at the planning stage of the audit process. These meetings should cover all issues that the parties consider may be of interest to the other parties in carrying out their statutory or fiduciary functions.<\/p><p>- Pre Audit Meeting: It is envisaged that this meeting will be held as part of the Trilateral Meeting process but it could also be held as a bilateral meeting if both the Central Bank and the auditor believe that it would be more beneficial to do so.<\/p><p>- Post Audit Meeting: It is envisaged that this meeting will be arranged after the audit report is signed off. However, this meeting may occur before audit sign off if it is deemed more beneficial.<\/p><p>- The Central Bank's Auditor Protocol is available at the following link:  <i>https:\/\/www.centralbank.ie\/docs\/default-source\/regulation\/codes\/gns-4-1-7he-auditor-protocol.pdf?sfvrsn=4<\/i><\/p><p>Reporting Obligations to the Central Bank<\/p><p>Client Asset Regulations for Investment Firms 2015 and Investor Money Regulations 2015 for Fund Service Providers<\/p><p>In accordance with the Client Asset Regulations for Investment Firms 2015 and Investor Money Regulations 2015 for Fund Service Providers an investment firm\/fund service provider should engage an external auditor to report (&ldquo;assurance report&rdquo;) at least on an annual basis on the investment firm&rsquo;s\/fund service provider&rsquo;s safeguarding of client assets and shall ensure that the external auditor appointed for this purpose receives full co-operation in a timely matter in relation to the preparation of the assurance report.<\/p><p>Statutory Duty Declaration\/Annual Positive Statement<\/p><p>Section 27B of the Central Bank Act 1997 places a duty on auditors to make a written report to the Central Bank, within one month after the date of the auditor&rsquo;s report on the financial service provider&rsquo;s financial statements or within such extended period as the Central Bank allows, stating whether or not circumstances have arisen that require the auditor to report a matter to the Central Bank under a prescribed enactment and if such circumstances have arisen specify those circumstances (the &ldquo;Statutory Duty Confirmation&rdquo;).<\/p><p>Auditors Reports to those charged with governance including &lsquo;Nil&rsquo; Return <\/p><p>Section 27C of the Central Bank Act 1997 requires that if the auditor of an entity regulated by the Central Bank makes a report to the entity, or those concerned with its management, on any matter that has come to the auditor&rsquo;s notice during the course of the financial statement audit (or while carrying out any work for the entity of a kind specified by the Central Bank), the auditor must provide the Central Bank with a copy of that report.

Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel. Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession. <\/p><p>As I, and my predecessor, have pointed out before, because of the price differential with Northern Ireland, the collection of SFCT is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State. This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities.\u00a0 This regime, which imposes higher environmental standards on coal in the State than applies in Northern Ireland, enables local authorities to undertake enforcement action to prevent the sale or distribution of coal that does not meet our standards.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I am advised that Revenue met with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here.\u00a0 I understand that contacts are ongoing with a view to undertaking a number of joint operations and to explore the scope for follow up action by Revenue in relation to persons found to be in breach of environmental regulations. However, any such operations will be based on a clear understanding of the statutory responsibilities of the agencies involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600061#WRE02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600061#WRE02800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Sick Leave","counter":251,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600061#WRE02700"},{"type":"question","counter":252,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[27654\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600061#WRE02800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if a person who is employed in the public sector and has exceeded the allowed sick leave days for a four-year period due to being involved in a car accident can appeal the decision to block their promotion chances for the next four years due to the sick leave overrun through no fault of his or her own; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":253,"content":"<p>The provisions of the Public Service Sick Leave Scheme (Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations 2014 (S.I.

One of the benefits of this new approach is that schools will have greater flexibility as to how they will deploy their resources.<\/p><p>The Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme\u00a0which was published by the NCSE on 30 May 2018 set out to ensure that the Scheme is achieving the best outcomes possible for children with special educational needs.

The distribution of the population necessitates a relatively large number of small primary schools. In the case of Principals in smaller schools, while management and administrations duties are smaller in scale than those of larger schools, they must be undertaken in addition to their full-time teaching duties.<\/p><p>The enrolment required for administrative principal in ordinary schools, Gaelscoileanna and schools in the Gaeltacht is 176 pupils, or 113 if operating a specialist autism unit.\u00a0<\/p><p>Schools that have less than this enrolment have teaching principals. Recently published Circular 40\/2018\u00a0is available on the Department&rsquo;s website, which outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties. Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.<\/p><p>Building on measures in previous budgets to enhance school leadership, Budget 2018 made &euro;0.4 million available to fund almost 4,600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This additional funding will see an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018\/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.<\/p><p>Budget 2017 allowed for the commencement of restoration of middle management posts as part of an agreed distributed leadership model and meant lifting the rigidity of the longstanding moratorium on these posts at primary and post-primary levels. This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.<\/p><p>&euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts (Assistant Principal I and Assistant Principal II) at both Primary and Post-Primary. (2,600 in total)<\/p><p>The selection and recruitment process is well under way in most of our primary schools and the majority of these new middle management posts will be filled in the current school year, including schools where the Principal is a &quot;Teaching Principal&quot;.<\/p><p>Circular 63\/2017 was issued by the Department in September 2017 which deals with and sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools.<\/p><p>While the Principal is ultimately responsible to the Board of Management for the management and leadership of the school, the Deputy Principal occupies a position of vital importance within the senior leadership team in each school. The Deputy Principal co-operates with the Principal in the fulfilment of the Principal's role and acts or deputises as the Principal in the Principal's absence.<\/p><p>In relation to the duties assigned to Assistant Principal\u00a0posts, the Principal following consultation with staff, agree the schedule of duties as best meet the needs of the school. These duties are designed to reduce the workload of the Principal.<\/p><p>I recently announced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the 2018\/19 school year. This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.<\/p><p>Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector. <\/p><p>The following table sets out a breakdown\u00a0of\u00a0the number of teaching principals in primary schools by county as requested.<\/p><p><b>Teaching Principals by county in 2017\/18 school year<\/b><\/p><p>The Principals in these schools are in schools with less than 176 pupils:<\/p><p><table><tr><th><b>COUNTY<\/b><\/th><th>Number of teaching Principals 2017\/18<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CARLOW<\/td><td>19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN<\/td><td>57<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE<\/td><td>88<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK<\/td><td>184<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>140<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DUBLIN <\/td><td>48<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY.<\/td><td>155<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY<\/td><td>101<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE<\/td><td>31<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY<\/td><td>46<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LAOIS<\/td><td>42<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEITRIM<\/td><td>29<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK<\/td><td>83<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LONGFORD<\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH <\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO<\/td><td>138<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH<\/td><td>52<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN<\/td><td>43<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>OFFALY<\/td><td>39<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON<\/td><td>79<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO<\/td><td>49<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY<\/td><td>113<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD<\/td><td>40<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH<\/td><td>47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD<\/td><td>59<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW<\/td><td>38<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>1765<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600065#WRJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600065#WRJ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[27864\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600065#WRJ03500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a site inspection has been carried out at a location (details supplied) by the design team for the project to evaluate the extent of work required to complete the project following the liquidation of a company; when the retendering for the project will commence; when it is hoped to have new contractors on-site to complete the project; if there is a new hoped for completion date for the project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>The delivery of the projects referred to by the Deputy has been\u00a0devolved to Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB). <\/p>  <p>  KWETB, its design team and officials from my Department&rsquo;s Planning and Building Unit are working closely to ensure that a new contractor is appointed as quickly as possible to complete both schools.

It is a whole-of-government support system for those seeking international protection in Ireland, although the term is more often used to describe the Accommodation Centres provided by the Reception and Integration Agency of my Department.  Notwithstanding the criticisms levelled at the system, particularly in terms of length of stay, it has proven effective in ensuring that those who come to our country seeking international protection receive food and shelter and have immediate access to our state services.  Over 60,000 people have been provided with shelter since its inception.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to predict how many people may arrive in any given year seeking international protection.  However, the system ensures that all applicants can be offered immediate shelter, full board accommodation and a range of services, such as health and education while their applications are being processed.  Not every person who seeks international protection chooses to accept this offer, and some choose to live independently or with friends in communities across the country, as they are entirely free to do.<\/p>  <p>  If the system was simply disbanded, as some have been calling for, without a viable alternative, the risks of consigning vulnerable people, who know neither our country, its systems nor our language, to poverty, exploitation and homelessness are multiplied.  The Government cannot countenance that.  I have not heard a viable alternative put forward as to how a person, who has unestablished needs and turns up here unexpectedly, can be immediately provided with shelter and an acceptable level of care.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of an alternative, any commitment to abolish a system that offers instant shelter and support would pose a serious risk to the wellbeing of protection applicants and undermine our international obligations.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the system has already been subject to a complete review in 2014.  Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon chaired a Working Group comprised of advocates and officials and made 173 recommendations for reform of the protection process including direct provision.  The report was accepted by Government and three separate itemised progress reports on these recommendations were published on my Department&rsquo;s website, resulting in change being achieved across 98% of the recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The improvements to living conditions for applicants for international protection have been significant over recent years.  These include the implementation of self or communal catering arrangements in a number of accommodation centres.  As a result of this initiative, over 1,500 residents are now able to prepare meals of their own choosing.  In addition, there have been improvements to a number of outdoor playgrounds and football pitches to provide for &lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; facilities and the introduction of teenagers rooms in centres to provide social areas for this age group.  Friends of the Centre groups have also been established in each centre.  This initiative aims to bring residents, community and voluntary groups together with a view to increasing integration opportunities and providing for the development of greater community linkages with the residents and the centre.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the McMahon Report, a Standards Advisory Group was set up in 2017.  The work of this group is to build on the recommendations of McMahon and to develop a set of standards for accommodation provided for those people seeking the protection of the State.  The Standards will meet the minimum standards set out in the Recast Reception Conditions Directive and EASO Guidance on Reception Conditions: Operational Standards and Indicators and will also take account of national developments in the provision of services to those in the protection process.  They will take due cognisance of the responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by policies and plans as defined by the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty.  The group is comprised of members from a range of organisations supporting refugees as well as staff from a number of government Departments and will deliver a Working Document in September 2018, following widespread consultation.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, individual problems and issues can and do arise when any individual interacts with a service provided by the state but, in such circumstances, where complaints are made and applicants are not happy with how matters are resolved, international protection applicants now have full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the improvements made arising from the recommendations in the McMahon Report, the Government has looked to further consolidate those improvements and build upon them.  In particular, the decision to opt into the (recast) Reception Conditions Directive represents another major reform of the process.  I am satisfied to report that the opt-in process has proceeded quickly and, on Tuesday 22 May 2018, the decision of the EU Commission confirming Ireland&rsquo;s opt in to the EU (Recast) Reception Directive was adopted.  The decision was published in the Official Journal the following day.  The opt-in process is continuing and will be concluded shortly.  This will allow the European Commission to conduct its assessment of the management and conditions pertaining to our Direct Provision system and present their findings in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to the on-going reform in relation to Direct Provision or any other aspect of our asylum system that may be required in order that we have a system in Ireland that reaches or exceeds the standards required by the Reception Conditions Directive and that will compare favourably with the best systems of our EU partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600066#WRK03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders Re-examination","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600066#WRK03600"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[27374\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600066#WRK03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a deportation order for a person (details supplied) will be rescinded to allow them remain here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":558,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order signed on 23 April 2009.<\/p><p>The statutory criteria which must be considered in relation to a decision to make a deportation order under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 include national security and public policy, the character and conduct of the person concerned and the common good.

No. 12 of 2016) commenced the bulk of the Act with effect from 18 January 2016.  That Commencement Order brought provisions of Parts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the Act into operation.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 355 of 2017) commenced part of section 47(c) of the Act with effect from 31 July 2017 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order 2017\u00a0(S.I. No. 474 of 2017) commenced provisions of the Act relating to adoption by civil partners and cohabiting couples with effect from 2 November 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Part 10 of the Act, which amended the Passports Act 2008, was commenced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on 1 July 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Part 11 of the Act, which related to adoption, was not commenced and was repealed by section 2(2) of the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, which came into operation on 19 October 2017, as provided for by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (Commencement) Order 2017 (S.I. No. 443\u00a0of 2017).  The provisions in Part 11 have been incorporated into\u00a0the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017, for which the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible.<\/p>  <p>  Section 177 of the Act has not yet been commenced.  Following adoption of the 34th amendment to the Constitution and its subsequent legislative changes, my Department identified a lacuna in the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 that prevents male same-sex married couples from availing of adoptive leave and benefits.  To address this lacuna, my Department has prepared draft legislative proposals that will amend the Adoptive Leave Act and will\u00a0afford the same entitlements to adoptive leave and benefits to all couples who are married, co-habiting or who are in a civil partnership, irrespective of gender.<\/p>  <p>  Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  The issue of the recognition of parentage for same-sex couples and their children is dealt with under Part 2 of the Act.  The Minister for Health has responsibility for commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Other provisions of the Act which relate to DAHR have not yet been commenced as they are linked to Parts 2 and 3.  The commencement of the provisions of the Act which are related to Parts 2 and 3 will be co-ordinated with the commencement of those Parts by the Minister for Health.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  That Bill will provide for the establishment of\u00a0an Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority which will, among other things, undertake certain functions under Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Part 9 of the Act provides for a number of amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004.  Section 95 deals with the re-registration of the birth of a donor-conceived child\u00a0on foot of a court order.  No provision of Part 9 has yet been commenced.  Some sections cannot be commenced until Parts 2 and 3 are brought into operation by the Minister for Health.  Other sections are dependent on provisions of the Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014 being commenced by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and my Department is liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in relation to scheduling the commencement of these sections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600066#WRK06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Leave to Remain","counter":583,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600067#WRL00300"},{"type":"question","counter":584,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[27496\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600067#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a stamp 4 application (detail supplied) will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":585,"content":"<p>The Deputy\u00a0will appreciate that his question primarily concerns\u00a0the issue\u00a0of eligible and ineligible categories of employment for employment permit purposes, which is a policy matter for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.\u00a0 My Department has no function in the matter. <\/p>  <p>  However, I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person's application for permission to remain in the State has been considered and that the person concerned has been notified of the decision.<\/p>  <p>  The original application was received from the person concerned on 2 November 2017 and a decision letter issued on 17 January 2018.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On 22 March 2018 a\u00a0review of the original application was requested as an exceptional measure.\u00a0\u00a0A decision letter in response to this exceptional request for a review of the original application was issued on 28 May 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.<\/p>  <p>  I have met the family involved and am aware of the circumstances of the case.

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. <\/p><p>The Garda stations referred to form part\u00a0of the Dublin Metropolitan Region (D.M.R) West Division. I am informed by the Commissioner that the number of Garda&iacute;\u00a0assigned to that Division\u00a0on 31 May 2018, the latest date for which information is readily available,\u00a0was 671, of whom 68 are community Garda&iacute;.\u00a0There are also\u00a026\u00a0Garda Reserves and\u00a055 Garda civilian staff\u00a0attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. \u00a0<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just\u00a0over 1,960 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide\u00a0of whom 194 were assigned to\u00a0the D.M.R. West Division including 39 from the recent attestation which took place on the 15 June. Garda<b><\/b>numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. <\/p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 400 of whom have attested\u00a0to date.\u00a0Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.<\/p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. <\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the D.M.R. West Division. <\/p><p>In relation to the number of &quot;Community Garda&iacute;&rdquo; it is important to recognise that community policing is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official\u00a0categorisation as a &ldquo;Community\u00a0Garda&quot;\u00a0simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities including through the giving of talks to schools, community groups and others.\u00a0It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.<\/p><p>I am assured by the Commissioner that the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part\u00a0in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs. Overall the Model advocates\u00a0a partnership based, pro-active, community-orientated style of policing. It is focused on crime prevention, problem-solving and law enforcement, with a view to building trust and enhancing the quality of life of the entire community.

After several years of improvement, the decline in Ireland's overall ranking is disappointing.  Despite the fall in competitiveness, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance remains positive.  The IMD Report shows that Ireland is the 3rd most competitive economy in the Euro area and the World Bank&rsquo;s most recent &ldquo;Doing Business 2018&rdquo; report ranks Ireland the 17th most competitive economy out of 190 countries.  <\/p>  <p>  The IMD report is a timely reminder of the importance of remaining competitive in a global environment.  It is important to continuously implement policies to improve our performance further considering significant challenges in the external environment, particularly Brexit.  That is why we are continually examining how we can improve on factors that are crucial to improving our competitiveness, including our cost base, infrastructure and the availability of talent and innovation.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 Renewed - which I launched in March - placed an increased emphasis on enhancing our competitiveness position by developing our Irish owned enterprises.  There is a strong focus on taking action that will embed resilience in our enterprise base.  We are placing a spotlight on innovation and on skills.  Enterprise Ireland also places a strong emphasis on competitiveness.  It supports exporting enterprises with initiatives in Lean, RD&amp;I, and management development.  The Agency helps enterprises to take a strategic approach to understanding and responding to potential implications arising from Brexit and assists them to enter into new markets and diversify their export base.  The Local Enterprise Offices offer a suite of supports to enhance the competitiveness of small and micro enterprises.  Initiatives include mentoring, innovation vouchers, Lean Start and access to a Brexit diagnostic and guidance.  <\/p>  <p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness remains a key economic priority for Government and we continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis.  The Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2018 Report, published by the National Competitiveness Council on 1st June, found that the cost base for enterprise is internationally competitive across a range of metrics (e.g. the cost of starting a business, communications costs and average income taxes).  Despite these improvements, Ireland remains a relatively high cost location and cost pressures are evident in property, credit, labour and business service costs.  <\/p>  <p>  Government is committed to taking action to address unnecessarily high costs (i.e. cost and price levels not justified by productivity) wherever they arise.  A range of initiatives set out in the Action Plan for Jobs are in train across Government Departments to improve the ease of doing business, reduce the administrative burden, enhance our cost competitiveness and productivity, and drive greater efficiencies across the enterprise base.  Through the Action Plan for Education and Pathways to Work the Government is working to ensure the pipeline of talent can meet the demand for labour to reduce labour cost pressure.  The ongoing work of the Personal Injuries Commission, the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance and the complementary work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group should help to reduce insurance costs for businesses.  In March, I launched the Brexit Loan Scheme which will make &euro;300 million available to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees at an interest rate of 4% or less.  Rebuilding Ireland Plan presents a wide-ranging set of commitments to address housing supply, and while many of these will take time, the Government is implementing and driving change.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of ensuring our cost competitiveness, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage the controllable portion of their respective cost bases, drive efficiency and continue to take action to address unnecessarily high costs.  Such actions will ensure that improvements in relative cost competitiveness are more sustainable, leaving Ireland better positioned to cope with external shocks.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":712,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN02500"},{"type":"question","counter":713,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[27918\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN02600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the action she is taking to attract foreign direct investment in view the fact that Ireland is included in the EU top ten for attracting foreign direct investment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":714,"content":"<p>I am proud that Ireland continues to perform very strongly in terms of attracting FDI.

This reflects the health of the pipeline of foreign direct investment (FDI) here. The mid-year results for 2018 indicate that we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in Ireland so attractive in the first place.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s overall FDI offering which despite an increasingly competitive global environment, remains very attractive to overseas companies.  Multinational companies invest in Ireland for many reasons, not just one.  Ireland has a strong pool of highly skilled workers and a first-class education system that produces top-level graduates.  <\/p>  <p>  Our country benefits as well from favourable demographics &ndash; over 40% of our population is under 29. Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the EU is another key selling point.  When companies establish operations here, they immediately benefit from barrier-free access to an EU market of over 500 million consumers.  Ireland is simply a great place to do business: we offer strong incentives for research and development, a rich talent pool and a stable and competitive corporation tax regime.  <\/p>  <p>  However we are not complacent and the Government is continuing to work hard to consolidate this country&rsquo;s traditional strength in terms of talent productivity and export competitiveness.  Ireland&rsquo;s ability to remain competitive in attracting FDI is dependent on the provision of high-quality infrastructure.  Underinvestment in capital infrastructure means that our future economic competitiveness would be harmed.  <\/p>  <p>  Through Project Ireland 2040, the Government is delivering a step-up in investment in road, energy, water and broadband infrastructure and in education and research facilities.

While there are no Trade Missions to Japan currently planned, an intensive programme of Ministerial visits and Trade Missions was carried out to mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Japan.  This programme concluded in March 2018, however the focus on growing Enterprise Ireland client exports to Japan continues.  <\/p>  <p>  High level visits by the Department of Education, SFI and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are planned for Q4 2018 including an event with Keidanren (Japan&rsquo;s largest business association) addressing matters impacting Trade and Investment with Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland is continuing with an intensive programme of inward buyer visits, fintech and life sciences initiatives, and Food FDI research in market.  <\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is the state agency under my aegis with responsibility for helping Irish companies to internationalise and scale.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Trade Missions and Events promote the capabilities of client companies to potential business partners and customers in international markets; a central element of the agency&rsquo;s strategy for 2017 -2020: Build Scale, Expand Reach.  In 2017 Enterprise Ireland ran 57 Ministerial-led international trade events, including a trade mission to Japan.  <\/p>  <p>  My predecessor, Ms. Frances Fitzgerald T.D., led a joint Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland trade and investment mission to Japan in September 2017.  The trade mission, which also included a visit to Singapore, took place over 5 days and involved 60 Enterprise Ireland client companies.  A Ministerial address to Keidanren presented an opportunity to engage with Japanese businesses and to sell the benefits of investing in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  On the 12th of March, Enterprise Ireland announced that it is set to undertake over 200 international and domestic trade events in 2018 to accelerate the number of Enterprise Ireland clients diversifying into new markets, beyond the UK and into the Eurozone and global markets.  The number of trade events being undertaken represents a 50% increase on 2017, reflecting the challenge that Brexit poses for Irish businesses.  70 of these export focused trade events will be led by Government Ministers.  <\/p>  <p>  A key objective of the most recent Trade Mission to Japan was to promote the potential of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), particularly from a &lsquo;new opportunities for Irish companies&rsquo; perspective.  It is expected that the Economic Partnership Agreement will be signed in July.  The Agreement will open opportunities for Irish exporters across a range of sectors through tariff reductions and the removal of other barriers to trade.  <\/p>  <p>  Japan currently has high tariffs on agricultural products which will be significantly reduced on a phased basis.  The EPA will also remove non-tariff barriers to trade in agricultural products bringing Japan&rsquo;s regulations more in line with other countries.  These measures will provide opportunities for Irish exporters in the agri-food sector in particular for producers of cheese, beef, pork and processed agricultural products.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to improved market access for goods, the EPA will present opportunities for the services sector. Irish exports of services to Japan were valued at &euro;4.8bn in 2016, an increase of 48% on the previous year.  The removal of barriers to trade in services through the EPA should support further growth in this area.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to promotion of the Economic Partnership Agreement, other objectives of the trade mission to Japan included supporting participating Irish companies to further their relationships with new and existing customers, deepening relationships with existing IDA clients to secure further investments for Ireland, and positioning Ireland as a post-Brexit solution for Asian companies.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of the &lsquo;Global Ireland 2025&rsquo; plan, which aims to take Ireland&rsquo;s global engagement to the next level by doubling our global footprint, the Government is committing significant resources to a new state-of-the-art Ireland House in Tokyo which will bring together a new embassy as well as state agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Bord Bia under one roof.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":721,"content":"<p>Question No. 292 answered with Question No. 271.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":723,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commencement of Legislation","counter":722,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN03500"},{"type":"question","counter":723,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[27489\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when sections 20 to 23 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 will be commenced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":724,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[27564\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will take steps to commence the section of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 that deals with children of same-sex couples and all related matters; his views on the distress, heartache and difficulties that its non-commencement is causing for families (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[27416\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when Parts 2, 3 and 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 will be commenced; the reason for the delay in commencing these Parts of the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":726,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[27574\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the legislation regarding assisted human reproduction will be commenced (detailed supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1219","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[27724\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties experienced by married same-sex couples in getting both their names on their child's birth certificate and the difficulties they experience when applying for passports and other State documents in view of the fact that they have to apply as sole parents; the steps he will take to rectify the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1309","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[27731\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600069#WRN04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the commencement date for Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.","asker":"1259","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":729,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293, 294, 309, 331, 370 and 371 together.  <\/p><p>A number of technical drafting issues have come to light in relation to Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.

We have increased funding to this body from &euro;3.7 million in 2010 to the current level of &euro;12 million. <\/p>  <p>  These actions are reflected in the most recent suicide statistics. In 2011, Ireland had a suicide rate of 12.1 per 100,000 population. This has dropped each subsequent year, with the provisional data for 2017 showing a suicide rate of 8.2 per 100,000 population. The most recent Eurostat data, which compares data of suicide rates across 33 European countries, shows that Ireland had the 10th lowest rate of suicide for males and females of all ages in 2015. <\/p>  <p>It should also be highlighted that the statistic mentioned within the question does not reflect current figures. Taking the most recent Eurostat figures from 2015, these show that when looking at numbers of men aged between 15-24 who died by intentional self-harm within the European Union, Ireland ranks 19th  . <\/p>  <p>  Connecting for Life has identified specific priority groups who are at specific risk of suicide, which includes young people. Reducing the suicide within these specific priority groups along with the whole population is a key outcome set out by the strategy. <\/p>  <p>  While funding mental health services, which is not exclusive to my department, is an important component of achieving a reduction in suicides and improved services, a proposal to simply add more money to the budget will not improve mental health services on its own. I would welcome proposals outlining recommendations and proposed actions from any organisation, which can in turn be evaluated on outcomes and available funding.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600074#WRS03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme","counter":1002,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600074#WRS03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1003,"qnumday":393,"qnumall":"[27881\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600074#WRS03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding the fair deal scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1004,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[27891\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600074#WRS03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the funding model in place for nursing homes (details supplied) will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1005,"qnumday":402,"qnumall":"[27906\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600074#WRS03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding the fair deal scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1006,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 393, 401 and 402 together.<\/p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care.

Measles is highly infectious.  It is a notifiable disease (under Infectious Disease legislation) and all cases are reported to Departments of Public Health for investigation and risk assessment.<\/p>  <p>  Measles is transmitted through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when the infected person coughs or sneezes. \u00a0The incubation period (the time from exposure to the virus until the first symptoms develop) is typically 10-12 days. From exposure to rash onset averages 14 days (7-18 days). Complications include a severe cough and breathing difficulties (croup), ear infections (1 in 20), viral and bacterial lung infections (pneumonia), and eye infections (conjunctivitis). Most of the complications are caused by secondary bacterial infections, which can be treated with antibiotics. More serious problems involve the nervous system and are rarer. Severe disease and complications are most likely in infants under 12 months, those with weakened immune systems, and the malnourished.<\/p>  <p>  All children, teenagers and young adults should be up to date with MMR vaccination. MMR was first introduced in 1988, all people born since then should have received two doses of MMR. \u00a0\u00a0Any child, teenager or adult who missed getting the MMR vaccines according to national immunisation schedule (first dose at 12 months and 2nd dose at 4-5 years of age) should contact their GP and ask about the vaccine. The HSE is working hard in those areas of the country where MMR uptake is low and is also\u00a0targeting marginalised groups where uptake of all vaccines has traditionally been low. <\/p>  <p>  Awareness has been raised about the on-going risk of measles in the community among health care staff, as cases, if more occur, are likely to present to health care settings. For hospitals and health care facilities, it is important that there is an immediate triage and isolation of all suspect cases presenting to the facility as this can help prevent spread in the facility.<\/p>  <p>  Due to increased MMR vaccination uptake in Ireland in the past decade measles has become relatively rare in recent years.\u00a0 In 2015 there were 6 measles cases, the lowest annual number reported since 1948 and a significant decrease on the previous year. Since then the number of cases reported has increased due to a number outbreaks associated with imported cases in people who had not been vaccinated. \u00a0The Weekly Infectious Disease Report for week 24-2018 (10\/6\/18-16\/6\/18), published by the HSE-Health Protection Surveillance Centre on 20 June 2018, indicates that 63 cases of measles have been notified so far in 2018. The bulk of these are associated with an outbreak in the Mid-West, with linked cases elsewhere. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE is taking actions to control this outbreak. An Outbreak Control Team meets weekly to investigate and control the spread of this potentially serious illness.\u00a0 The HSE Departments of Public Health in areas where cases are identified are investigating and implementing control and communication measures with local GPs, and hospitals and in the community. The response has emphasised increasing uptake of the MMR vaccine which is the best method of preventing additional cases of measles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600075#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":1042,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600075#WRT01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1043,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[27927\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600075#WRT01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the increases in the number of older persons waiting for home supports;

To ensure vaccine supply, this tender process must be completed 9 months in advance of the first delivery into Ireland at the end of August. \u00a0The HSE has already completed and awarded the tender for the supply of trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine for 2018\/19 at a cost of &euro;3.2- 4 million (depending on whether contingency doses are procured).\u00a0The trivalent vaccine used in Ireland is the most widely used influenza vaccine in Europe.<\/p><p>Every winter the HSE develops a Flu Plan aimed at reducing the incidence of influenza in the general population and on preparing the health services to deal with increased activity resulting from increased influenza rate. Last winter the primary focus was\u00a0on increasing vaccination rates among healthcare workers and at risk groups. The additional measures put in place last winter\u00a0included:<\/p><p>- A national flu planning steering group which meets weekly is in place.<\/p><p>- A\u00a0flu lead was put in place in each Public Health Department, who liaised with CHO and Hospital Group flu planning groups.<\/p><p>- There was digital advertising and promotions target at risk groups, the over 65s, pregnant women and healthcare workers. <\/p><p>- Each HG and associated CHO produced a Winter Plan which includes a specific section on Flu.<\/p><p>- The Flu Medication Protocol was revised.<\/p><p>The HSE also put in place additional measures to ensure it was in a position to identify and react to any significant increase in health service demands. These included:<\/p><p>- The National Flu Planning Group continues to meet every Friday.<\/p><p>- The SDU continues to liaise daily with HGs.<\/p><p>- Additional measures were activated when the ILI rate exceeded the baseline figures which\u00a0fed into the Winter Initiative Planning and include cascading of information to HGs, CHOs and GPs concerning the use of anti-virals, respiratory hygiene, rescheduling of elective surgery and the activation of discharge plans.<\/p><p>These measures mitigated the impact of the sustained higher influenza rates on the health services last winter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600075#WRT05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":1079,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600076#WRU00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1080,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[27953\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600076#WRU00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if personnel in his Department have been removed from their position, have been transferred to another role or had their employment terminated in the past four years due to breaches of departmental standards or professional misconduct or incompetence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1081,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that nobody in my Department has been removed from their position, been transferred to another role or had their employment terminated in the past four years due to breaches of departmental standards, professional misconduct or incompetence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600076#WRU00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1082,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600076#WRU00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1083,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[27980\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600076#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1084,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

In addition, up to the end of 2017, the ESB installed free home charge points for the purchasers of new electric vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  In March 2014, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities approved an application from ESB Networks to recover the costs to a maximum of &euro;25 million from network charges to cover the rollout of this infrastructure. Following a public consultation process, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published its independent regulatory decision in October 2017. A key outcome of the decision is that expansions of the public charging network and the installation of home charging points could no longer be funded from network charges. <\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of electric vehicle charging happens at home, which aligns with both technology and patterns of use of vehicles. To support home charging, I introduced the Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant scheme this year.  This scheme, which came into operation on 1 January 2018, supports the cost of installing a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600 for buyers of both new and second-hand electric vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  The regulatory decision by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities also set out the need for the electric vehicle charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis.  In the absence of State-led support, this is unlikely to happen in the near term.  Capital funding of &euro;1.5m has, therefore, been allocated in my Department's budget this year to support the provision of public charging.<\/p>  <p>  A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network.

With the increased multi-annual capital funding that I secured as part of Budget 2018, there is over &euro;110 million specifically allocated to developing \"active travel\" (i.e. cycling and walking) at a national level over the period 2018-2021.  This programme will provide safe alternative active travel routes to help alleviate congestion by providing viable alternatives and connectivity with existing public transport infrastructure.

Cycle Right training aims to give trainees the confidence, skill and road safety knowledge to use their bike safely.  Over a series of stages, cyclists will increase their proficiency and safe journeying on the road network. A key element to this training are the rules of the road.  Cycle Right roll-out in our schools and communities is a key component of the resources made available by me in training participants to cycle safely and to move towards more active, healthy lifestyles.

To date 51 pools have been completed under the Programme and these are listed in the table below. <\/p><p>There are four principal stages in the LASPP, namely: Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation.  My officials and technical advisor evaluate each stage and projects cannot proceed to the next stage unless prior approval is given by the Minister.  <\/p><p>In January 2016, my Department contacted local authorities and sought expressions of interest in a limited round of swimming pool allocations.  There were three expressions of interest received for new pools, two of which were valid and both in Dublin, one in Lucan and the other in Ballyogan.  The third was for North Kildare but was not valid as the Council did not have title to the proposed site.  Following consideration of the expressions of interest, and the two valid proposals for new pools, it was decided to include the proposal from South Dublin County Council (SDCC) for a new swimming pool in Lucan in the LASPP.<\/p><p>In April 2016,<b><\/b>pool projects in<b><\/b>Balbriggan, Ballaghaderreen and Loughrea, which<b><\/b>had been included in the 2000 round of the Programme since 2000, were voluntarily withdrawn from the programme by the relevant local authorities.  <\/p><p>Glenalbyn was also originally included in the 2000 round of the LASPP.  However, in 2010, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council (DLRCC) asked that Glenalbyn be replaced in the LASPP with Loughlinstown.  Following receipt of a detailed case, the Department agreed to the Council&rsquo;s request. &euro;3.8 million was then allocated to Loughlinstown swimming pool in 2010 and the pool was developed and<i><\/i>opened in May 2013.  Accordingly Glenalbyn Pool is not considered to be in the current round of the Programme.<\/p><p>As mentioned earlier, in January 2016 the Department sought expressions of interest for the construction of new swimming pools and\/or the refurbishment of existing pools.  In response to this, DLRCC submitted an expression of interest for a pool for Ballyogan.  An expression of interest for a grant for Glenalbyn swimming pool was not submitted.<\/p><p>Accordingly, there are currently four projects remaining in the current round of the LASPP.  These are: Castlebar, Co Mayo, (a replacement pool where construction is underway and is nearing completion); Buncrana, Co Donegal, (a refurbishment which is at Contract Documents stage); Lucan, Co Dublin, (a new pool which is at Contract Documents stage); and Edenderry, Co Offaly, (a replacement pool which is at Preliminary Report stage).  The priority in 2018 is on progressing the four projects through to the next stages of the programme, as appropriate. <\/p><p>In terms of any possible future funding, the recently published National Development Plan (NDP) contains a commitment to establish a new &ldquo;Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund&rdquo; (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100m available over the coming years.  It is intended that the Fund will primarily be targeted at larger new projects, including swimming pools, where the proposed Government contribution exceeds the amount currently available for individual projects under the Sports Capital Programme.  The draft terms and conditions of the new scheme are expected to be finalised shortly and an announcement in relation to when applications will be accepted will be made once this work is complete.  At this stage, it is envisaged that the fund will be initially focused on the National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities and the possibility of accepting applications for larger scale refurbishment work is being considered.<table><tr><th><\/th><th>County<\/th><th>Pool   Name<\/th><th>Replacement or Refurbishment<\/th><th>Date

That growing trend will be catered for\u00a0by providing a network of safe cycling facilities that will encourage increased numbers to adopt what is a convenient and healthy mode of transport.\u00a0 As traffic levels rise in urban areas, cycling will play an increasing role in alleviating congestion and contributing to economic success.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0the Greater Dublin Area there has been a significant modal shift. The Annual Canal Cordon Report recently published by Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority - which provides data on trends in mode share of vehicles and people crossing the Canal Cordon\u00a0in Dublin between 7am and 10am - indicates\u00a0this change.\u00a0 It shows that 70% of all inbound trips crossing the canal cordon were made by a sustainable mode which includes cycling, walking, taxi and other public transport.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last 11 years, the share for sustainable modes has grown by 9 percentage points, and since 2010 there has continually been year-on-year growth.\u00a0 The most recent figures show that the mode share for cars has dropped to under 30% for the first time; it is now 29.2%, compared to 40% as recently as 2010.

Guardian's payment (contributory) and guardian's payment (non-contributory) are, respectively, social insurance and social assistance (means-tested) payments made to a person caring for a child, where that child is defined as an orphan under social welfare legislation.  These payments were known as orphan's payments until they were re-named in July 2006.<\/p><p>The purpose of the guardian's payment scheme is to provide income support in respect of those children whose parents are unable to provide for them, through death or other circumstances.  Currently, there are around 1,600 people receiving guardian's payments in respect of approximately 2,300 children. Expenditure on guardian's payments schemes (contributory and non-contributory) was &euro;19.7 million in 2017.  A budget increase of &euro;5 per week per orphan, implemented from March 2018, brings the weekly rate to &euro;181 per orphan; the highest rate of weekly child income support paid by my Department.<\/p><p>Responsibility for fostering arrangements rests with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Specifically, under the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, &ldquo;<i>National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020 &ndash; Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures<\/i>&rdquo;, responsibility for supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children and the provision of family support services lies with T&uacute;sla, the Child and Family Agency.  Family support services provided under the National Policy Framework are available to all families in the State, not just those caring for foster children.<\/p><p>While it is acknowledged that there are perceived similarities between guardian's payments and foster care allowance payments, the schemes differ fundamentally in their purpose.  As outlined, the aim of the guardian's payment scheme administered by my Department is the provision of income support.  However, the Child and Family Agency in exercising its functions has a broader range of responsibilities and considerations in respect of children in the care of the State than the provision of income support alone.<\/p><p>Foster care allowance for a child up to 12 years is payable at the weekly rate of &euro;325, increasing to &euro;352 for those over 12 years.  Any proposal to align the weekly rate of guardian's payment to that of foster care allowance would have to be considered by Government in an overall budgetary context.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600082#WRAA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Births","counter":1448,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600082#WRAA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1449,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[27679\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600082#WRAA02400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will address a matter raised in correspondence (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1450,"content":"<p>The current legislation governing registration of births provides only for the registration of a mother's details and a father's details.

CIB delivers on this remit through a network of service delivery partners including the Citizens Information Services (CIS) and the, Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS). <\/p>  <p>  In February 2017, the Board of CIB made a decision to reorganise the governance arrangements of the 93 individual local companies to a new regionally based 16 company model comprising 8 CIS and 8 MABS companies.  The aim of the change is to improve the effectiveness of the control environment, financial management and governance of the CIS and MABS networks which are 100% State funded.  The change is about improving the governance framework, focusing on frontline service delivery to citizens, improving the consistency and quality of service delivery and where possible, extending services for those who need them.  I am satisfied that the board of CIB made this decision in the best interest of the citizens which it serves.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the Board's decision has already seen the establishment of 6 new companies &ndash; 3 CIS and 3 MABS in North Leinster, South Munster and Dublin South. All staff, assets and liabilities of the 38 local companies involved in this phase have transferred to the new companies. There has  been no change to service delivery points, no reduction in staffing, nor has there been any diminution of services for clients. The final phase of implementation is now underway, with the remaining 5 CIS and 5 MABS regional companies due to be established in Q4, 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The annual grant provided to CIB under Section 4 of the Comhairle Act 2000 is accounted for under Section 22 of the Act, which requires that the annual accounts, approved by the Board, are submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG). <\/p>  <p>  CIB's  2017 accounts have already been submitted to the C&amp;AG for audit.  When the audit is complete, a copy of the annual accounts and the report of the CandAG will be presented to the Board and to the Minister and will then be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as required by legislation.<\/p>  <p>Section 24 of the Comhairle Act, 2000 requires CIB to make an Annual Report to the Minister by 30th June each year.  The annual report for 2017 is expected by the required date and will be laid the Houses of the Oireachtas, as required by legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600082#WRAA06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":1491,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600083#WRBB00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Data","counter":1490,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600083#WRBB00400"},{"type":"question","counter":1491,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[27433\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600083#WRBB00500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the expenditure in each of the years 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018 on RAS, HAP and all other housing payments to landlords being paid rent through one or other of the schemes for categories of units (details supplied).","asker":"1259","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":1492,"qnumday":579,"qnumall":"[27470\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600083#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the expenditure by his Department on rent supplement payments including RAS, HAP and all other housing payments to landlords being paid rent through one or other of these schemes for units (details supplied), respectively in each of the years 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018, in tabular form; and the housing estates and apartment complexes in which more than 10% of units are in receipt of the respective types of rent supplement.","asker":"1259","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1493,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 563 and 579 together.<\/p><p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is now available to all eligible households throughout the State.

Net income means that income tax, Universal Social Charge, pension-related deduction within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, and PRSI are deducted from the relevant assessable gross income.  The income of all persons aged 18 years and over included in a social housing application is assessed for the purposes of determining whether an applicant household meets the income requirements.<\/p>  <p>  In general, all income is assessable including all social welfare payments received except a specific list of payments that include for example child benefit, education grants, carer's allowance, payments under FAS schemes and fuel allowance.  The Means Policy specifically states that Family Income Supplement (now known as Working Family Payment or WFP) is deemed to be income for the purposes of assessing eligibility for social housing.  This is appropriate for assessing the level of social housing support that may be given, as such support is based on the means of the household seeking the support and may be subject to review if the circumstances of the household change.  The Social Housing Support Household Means Policy was developed in 2011 and is currently under review by my Department, with a view to assessing whether the approach taken is still appropriate in the current housing context and to ensure that household income is treated in a consistent manner across the social housing system.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme, it is not, as a general rule, available to those in receipt of unemployment or other social welfare benefits.  However, where there is a primary income of a waged or salaried nature, long-term State benefit payments may be considered.  State benefit payments allowable are:<\/p>  <p>  - State Pension (Contributory);<\/p>  <p>  - State pension (Non-Contributory);<\/p>  <p>  - Widow&rsquo;s\/Widower&rsquo;s Pension;<\/p>  <p>  - Blind Pension;<\/p>  <p>  - Invalidity Pension; and<\/p>  <p>  - Disability Allowance.<\/p>  <p>  The reason that these payment are considered as assessable income for the scheme is that they are long-term payments.  The inclusion of other social welfare payments, which are more short-term, would not be appropriate in determining a capacity of applicants to repay a loan over a period of up to 30 years, as is the case with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.<\/p>  <p>  The long-term nature of the social welfare payment must be confirmed by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  All applications are dealt with on a case-by-case basis and are referred to the relevant local authority's Credit Committee for a final decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600084#WRCC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1546,"content":"<p>Question No. 582 answered with Question No. 576.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1547,"content":"<p>Question No. 583 answered with Question No. 575.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Mortgages","counter":1548,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600084#WRCC00700"},{"type":"question","counter":1549,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[27569\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018062600084#WRCC00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount spent on the mortgage allowance per annum since its inception until its disestablishment; the number of units provided per annum through that period in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1550,"content":"<p>The Mortgage Allowance scheme provides for an allowance of up to &euro;11,450 payable over a 5 year period to tenants or tenant purchasers of local authority housing, to assist them to purchase or have a private house built with a mortgage.

The current number of MEPs in the European Parliament is 750 plus the President with each Member State having between 6 and 96 Members.<\/p>  <p>  Council Decision 2013\/312\/EU provided that it would be revised again in advance of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term upon an initiative of the European Parliament to be presented to the European Council before the end of 2016.  The launch of this process was, however, postponed by the European Parliament&rsquo;s Committee on Constitutional Affairs (i.e. the AFCO Committee) until after the referendum in the United Kingdom on its withdrawal from the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Following a report on the matter by the AFCO Committee, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on 7 February 2018 which contains a Proposal for a Decision of the European Council establishing the composition of the European Parliament.  In broad terms, the proposal provides, among other things, that:<\/p>  <p>  - when the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union becomes legally effective, 27 of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s 73 seats would be re-distributed among 14 Member States, of which 2 would go to Ireland, increasing Ireland&rsquo;s MEPs from 11 to 13 in number.  This would mean a reduction in the overall size of the European Parliament from 751 to 705 members;<\/p>  <p>  - however, as set out in the Parliament's resolution, if the date on which the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union becomes legally effective takes place after the European Parliament elections are held in mid-2019, the number of MEPs to be elected from each Member State for the 2019-2024 parliamentary term would remain the same as that of the current parliament.  The additional seats would only be filled on the date after which the United Kingdom's withdrawal becomes legally effective.<\/p>  <p>  The proposal, which will require unanimity, is now under consideration within the European Council.  My Department is aware that the consent of the Parliament was sought by the Council by way of written procedure and that MEPs gave their consent to the proposal on 13 June 2018.  I understand that it is anticipated that the proposal will be adopted by the European Council at its meeting on 28-29 June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In the event that Ireland&rsquo;s total number of seats in the European Parliament is changed in respect of the 2019-2024 parliamentary term, it will be necessary to review our European constituency arrangements.  Under section 5(1A) of the Electoral Act 1997, provision is made for the establishment of a Constituency Commission in such circumstances to review, and report with recommendations on, European Parliament constituencies.  This was done in 2013 prior to the last elections to the European Parliament.<\/p>  <p>  On the matter of local electoral areas, I established two independent Local Electoral Area Boundary Committees on 13 December 2017 to review and make recommendations on local electoral areas having regard to, among other things, the results of Census 2016 as well as the commitment to consider reducing the size of territorially large local electoral areas as set out in A Programme for a Partnership Government (May 2016).
