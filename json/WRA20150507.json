These patterns\u00a0reflect the efficacy of the Irish tax and social welfare system in reducing market income inequality and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has\u00a0shown the Irish system to be one of the most effective of all OECD countries in this respect.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The fact that this Government has maintained such a progressive and redistributive\u00a0tax and social welfare system during one of the most difficult fiscal consolidations in the history of the State demonstrates its\u00a0commitment to equality and fairness.  ESRI\u00a0research shows that Budgets 2009-2015 had neither\u00a0a progressive nor a regressive pattern and that losses due to\u00a0budgetary policy were highest for those in the top ten percent of the income distribution followed by those in the bottom ten percent.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  With respect to wealth inequality, comprehensive data on household wealth in Ireland, including assets and liabilities, has been published\u00a0for the first time by the CSO.

At the time it was introduced, the expected yield from the USC in its first year, in 2011, was to be equivalent to that raised under the two taxes which it replaced, with an additional estimated yield of &euro;420 million in a full year.<\/p>  <p>  The USC\u00a0was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.\u00a0 It was designed and incorporated in to the Irish taxation system as part of its permanent structure and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.\u00a0\u00a0It is also a fair tax in that income cannot, in general, be sheltered from the charge through the use of tax reliefs.  I am cognisant of how unpopular the USC is but given that it raises over &euro;4 billion per annum for the Exchequer, it is difficult to see how it could be abolished without the imposition of additional taxation elsewhere or through equivalent cuts in expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Government has sought to ensure that the impact of the charge on those with the lowest incomes is minimised.  In Budget 2012, I increased the threshold at which the charge becomes payable from just over &euro;4,000 to just over &euro;10,000, which removed approximately 330,000 individuals from the scope of USC.  A further 87,000 individuals were removed from the scope of the charge in Budget 2015 when I further increased the threshold to just over &euro;12,000, as well as reducing the lower rates of USC and increasing the bands.  The Government has indicated that it will continue to adjust the USC in a similar\u00a0manner to the changes introduced in the last Budget.  I would hope to be in a position to be able to further increase the threshold for USC to remove a further 90,000 individuals from the scope of the charge.

I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates.  This is a commercial decision for the institutions concerned. <\/p>  <p>  Equally, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in his opening statement to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last November stated that in Ireland, as in most advanced economies, it has long been understood that tight administrative control over the rates charged by banks would be counterproductive in ensuring a sufficient flow of properly priced credit on a lasting basis.  Such control would strongly discourage new entrants when, in fact, ongoing competition in the banking sector will be crucial in ensuring that the economy is provided with efficient and cost effective banking services. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, there have been some movements on mortgage interest rates of late by a number of institutions which suggest that the market may be entering a new and more competitive phase.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Act) 2013\u00a0introduced changes to\u00a0Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 which regulates fees and charges in order to attract new entrants to the Irish\u00a0banking sector.  There is some evidence of\u00a0improvements in the\u00a0banking\u00a0sector with a number of institutions introducing new products and adapting their business model.\u00a0 In the last 12 months there have been a number of new entrants to the Irish mortgage market bringing additional and welcome competition to this sector.<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review.  I discussed the issue of mortgage interest rates with the Governor of the Central Bank on 2 April.  As a result of this meeting the Governor \u00a0is currently reviewing the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders.  The Governor should be in a position to present this analysis to me in the coming days.

The incentive provides tax relief for homeowners by way of a tax credit at 13.5% of qualifying expenditure incurred on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on a principal private residence.  In the last\u00a0Budget I extended the scheme to include rental properties, whose owners are subject to income tax.<\/p>  <p>  The Home Renovation Incentive has been very successful to date with works on just over 19,257 homes notified to the Revenue HRI online system as of 23 April 2015.\u00a0 This represents more than &euro;403 million worth of works involving some 4,869 contractors.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The tax credit is only available to the homeowner and not to children or other individuals who may fund the works.  However,\u00a0the Deputy will be aware that\u00a0a Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability is available from local authorities.  That scheme provides grant aid to applicants to assist in the carrying out of works that are reasonably necessary for the purposes of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation needs of a person with a disability.  The grant can assist with changes and adaptations to a home such as making it wheelchair accessible, extending it to create more space, adding a ground floor bathroom or toilet or installing a stair lift.  The grant, which is means tested, can cover up to 95% of the cost of works carried out, which is far more generous than the relief available under the Home Renovation Incentive.<\/p>  <p>  Works which are grant-aided also qualify for the Home Renovation Incentive.  Three times the value of the grant is deducted from overall expenditure, with any remainder attracting the tax credit of 13.5%.  This is\u00a0good fiscal practice in that relief is not provided twice for the same expenditure.  It is worth noting that the deduction in respect of grant-aided work is not taken into consideration for the purposes of reaching the minimum spend threshold of &euro;4,405, excluding VAT.<\/p>  <p>  As with all tax incentives and reliefs, it will be reviewed in the context of my deliberations for the Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700042#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Debt","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700042#WRA03700"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[17574\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700042#WRA03800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the projected cost of debt service on the national debt; the interest and repayments for each year from 2015 to 2020; and the projected increases in public spending for each of these years.","asker":"1195","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>The most recent forecasts of both National Debt interest and General Government interest expenditure for the period 2015 to 2020 are contained in the draft Stability Programme Update (SPU), published on the 28<sup>th<\/sup>of April by my Department.

Where a borrower engages with his lender, a sustainable restructure arrangement to address his\/her mortgage arrears situation is agreed in the majority of cases.

The tax is charged on the amount gifted to, or inherited by, the beneficiary of the gift or inheritance.<\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of CAT, the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e. the beneficiary), determines the maximum life-time tax-free threshold known as the \"Group threshold\" below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise.<\/p>  <p>  There are, in all, three separate Group thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.<\/p>  <p>  The Group A tax free threshold of &euro;225,000, applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<\/p>  <p>  The Group B tax free threshold of &euro;30,150, applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<\/p>  <p>  The Group C tax free threshold &euro;15,075, applies in all other cases.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person receives gifts or inheritances in excess of their relevant tax free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess over the tax free threshold. In recent years these thresholds were reduced and the rate has been increased in order to maintain the yield from capital taxes in the face of falling asset prices and as part of our fiscal consolidation efforts. In addition, taxes on capital are less harmful from an economic perspective than taxes on employment.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the property market continues to improve, with positive developments which had been restricted to the Dublin area now manifesting in other areas of the country, though not to the same extent in terms of price rises, and I recognise that this has a bearing on taxation of the inheritance and gifting of property with respect to CAT thresholds. In this light, I will be keeping Capital Acquisitions Tax thresholds and other aspects of the tax under review, particularly in the context of preparations for Budget 2016 and the consequent Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700043#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Targets","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700043#WRB01350"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[17570\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700043#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in view of his spring statement announcement of 200,000 net new jobs by 2018, if he has been in contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure these jobs will not be low paid or low hours; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>Since the low-point of the crisis experienced in the second half of 2012, some 95,000 jobs have been created to date.

In this respect, the SLs\u00a0appointed PwC as independent advisors to value the residential mortgage portfolio and to\u00a0provide advice in developing a strategy for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio which would ensure that maximum value was obtained for all creditors of IBRC. I further instructed the SLs to ensure that the sale of all loan assets was agreed or completed by no later than 31 December 2013 or as soon as practicable thereafter.<\/p>  <p>  Per my instruction, the assets of IBRC could only be sold at a price equal to or in excess of the independent valuations obtained.

The main deductible expenses are:<\/p><p>- any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;<\/p><p>- the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;<\/p><p>- the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;<\/p><p>- the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and <\/p><p>- payment of local authority rates. <\/p><p>In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.<\/p><p>The effect of the deduction of allowable expenses from gross rent means that the amount of taxable rental income will often be substantially lower than the gross rent, and could, depending on individual circumstances, be nil.<\/p><p>The Government is monitoring the rental market closely and the overriding objective in relation to rents is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.\u00a0Housing policy is a matter for the Department of Environment, and my officials have been in contact with officials in that department.

As the Deputy will be aware, on 1 May AIB Group announced a number of reductions to its mortgage interest rates for owner occupier and buy-to-let mortgages. <\/p>  <p>  A series of reductions over a fixed time frame would be acceptable to me and in that context I welcome AIB's announcement as a good first step. <\/p>  <p>  The effective management of the\u00a0mortgage arrears issue\u00a0is an area that remains under continuous review.\u00a0 More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears.\u00a0 As the Deputy is aware\u00a0the Taoiseach has previously announced that\u00a0the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake\u00a0of personal insolvency solutions.\u00a0\u00a0Given the importance of the issue, his Department is co-ordinating the response across the various Government Departments and agencies and I anticipate that a detailed announcement will be forthcoming shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700045#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700045#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[17903\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700045#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason there was a 4% annual withdrawal limit applied to Approved Minimum Retirement Funds; if there is flexibility in this restriction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"989","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>Finance Act 2014 introduced changes to allow owners of approved minimum retirement funds (AMRFs) to draw-down up to 4% of the assets of such funds on one occasion in each year instead of the facility to draw-down the accrued income and gains of such funds, as had applied prior to the changes. <\/p>  <p>  I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements (the so-called \"ARF option\"), where an individual in a Defined Contribution pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum \"set aside\" amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with those funds.<\/p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owner's discretion (subject to tax, at the marginal rate and having regard to the imputed distribution requirements). <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension \"nest-egg\" to provide for the latter years of his\/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate. <\/p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided. <\/p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy. <\/p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or a draw down of a lesser value than will now be permitted. I consider that the change will be to the benefit of AMRF owners, generally, over the medium to longer term and I have no plans to reverse it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700045#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Resolution Processes","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700045#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[17915\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700045#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide, in tabular form, figures showing the exact numbers of persons who are currently experiencing the problem of mortgage arrears and family home repossession, by county.

Once these works are completed the availability of flood insurance in affected areas would be expected to increase.<\/p><p>The OPW and Insurance Ireland have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes.\u00a0 The outcome of this arrangement, which came into effect in June 2014,\u00a0is that the insurance industry will have a much greater level of information and understanding of the extent of the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence works and will therefore be\u00a0in a position to reflect this in assessing the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed.\u00a0The arrangements set out in the Memorandum represent an ongoing process which, over time, should lead to an improvement in the availability of flood insurance cover.<\/p><p>The OPW and the Department of Finance will continue contact with Insurance Ireland to review the operation of the Memorandum of Understanding.<\/p><p>In cases where individuals\u00a0are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact\u00a0Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.

The Code was first published in 2009 and has been updated on a number of occasions since.\u00a0 The CCMA sought to deliver on the following established principles:<\/p>  <p> 1. Ensure the appropriate resolution of each borrower's arrears situation;<\/p>  <p>  2. Ensure that lenders deal with borrowers in a fair and transparent manner;<\/p>  <p>  3. Support and facilitate meaningful engagement between lenders and borrowers; and <\/p>  <p>  4. Ensure borrower awareness of the benefits of cooperating with their lender and the consequences of not cooperating.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that the CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long-term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his\/her mortgage obligations.\u00a0 A lender may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort under the Code to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his\/her nominated representative and the specific timeframes set out in the Code have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating. <\/p>  <p>  Where a borrower engages with his lender with a view to putting in place a restructure arrangement to address his\/her mortgage arrears situation, repossession of the family home should only be considered as a last resort.\u00a0 The Central Bank's most recent quarterly release on Residential Mortgage arrears and Repossessions (Q4 2014) indicates that almost 115,000 restructure arrangements have been put in place up to the end of December and of these almost 85% were deemed to be meeting the terms of their arrangement.\u00a0 This shows that active engagement can deliver positive results and in\u00a0the majority of\u00a0cases will enable a borrower in mortgage distress to remain in his\/her family home.<\/p>  <p>  Many borrowers can also\u00a0find solutions through the options offered by the Insolvency Service of Ireland and Government will ensure that the personal insolvency process is as fair and effective as possible and that the objectives as set out in the original Personal Insolvency Act are realised as much as possible.\u00a0\u00a0 My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, and her officials are actively preparing amendments to the legislative framework for personal insolvency aimed at\u00a0enabling Government's objectives in this regard to be met and allowing more people in distressed debt to access the available mechanisms than has been the case to date.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The effective management of mortgage arrears is, however, an area that remains under continuous review.\u00a0 more and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears and, as the Taoiseach has previously announced, the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the update of personal insolvency solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700046#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700046#WRE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[18037\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700046#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which this economy remains competitive, as compared with other eurozone and non-Eurozone European Union member states; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>Substantial progress has been made in improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There has been a significant improvement in Ireland's economy-wide cost competitiveness.

To the extent that they \u00a0feed through positively to impairment provisions, it further strengthens the banks' capital positions and consequently improves the valuation of the State's shareholdings. In addition rising values can also assist the credit channel through the provision of stronger collateral.<\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, excessive property price increases could adversely affect the affordability of accommodation.\u00a0 This could restrict individuals' mobility and harm our economic competitiveness. In light of this, a return to affordability levels seen at the peak of the property bubble would be unwelcome.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it is Government policy to tackle the impediments and barriers to housing supply which should contribute to a reduction in property price pressures. Construction 2020 sets out the Government's strategy for addressing issues in the property and construction sectors. \u00a0The strategy involves ensuring that any critical bottlenecks impeding the sector in meeting residential and commercial demand are addressed. It incorporates 75 time-bound actions encompassing the development of an overall strategic approach to housing supply,\u00a0identifying and implementing further improvements in the planning process, and seeking to improve financing options for development and mortgage provision. This work is complemented by the Social Housing Strategy which\u00a0was launched\u00a0last November. This Strategy aims to provide more than 35,000 new homes to meet social housing needs by 2020 and to deliver up to 75,000 units of long term accommodation through local authority housing support schemes for tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700046#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Lending","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700047#WRF00150"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[18043\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700047#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied that sub-prime lending has ceased or that any evidence exists of interest rates reminiscent of a previous era continuing to apply; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>Sub-prime lenders usually lend to borrowers who are unable to borrow from traditional lenders usually due to insufficient income or poor credit history.

It was clear that the tax base had to be broadened and tax expenditures curtailed or abolished if the serious financial and economic problems facing the country were to be addressed. Given the very significant cost of pension tax reliefs, such reliefs could not escape attention. Apart from contributing to the curbing of overall tax expenditures, the pension-related tax changes introduced also brought greater equity to the system by impacting for the most part primarily on higher earners. Indeed, I have introduced further restrictions in this area by, for example, reducing the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT)   the maximum tax relievable pension fund at retirement   to &euro;2 million from its previous level of &euro;2.3 million with effect from 1 January 2014 and by changing the valuation factor used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit pension schemes from a standard factor of 20 to a higher age-related factor that varies with the individual's age at the point at which pension benefits are drawn down. These changes to the SFT regime apply to pension arrangements across the board in both the private and the public sector.<\/p>  <p>  In the same vein, the original 0.6% stamp duty levy on pension fund assets, which I introduced in 2011 and which ended last year, was used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and create new jobs. These include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and the Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives, such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.\u00a0 It is the case that the levy does not apply to unfunded public service pension schemes. However, the pensions of public servants have been subject to a public service pension reduction (PSPR) since 1 January 2011. The PSPR was introduced on 1 January 2011 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010. The PSPR is not a levy but is a pension cut affecting public service pensions, including those of former members of the Oireachtas and Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  While the 0.6% pension fund levy has ceased and the lower 0.15% levy introduced for 2014 and 2015 will not apply beyond 2015, I have no plans to either repay the pension fund levy tax collected or to retrospectively reinstate the higher earnings limit for pension contributions, as may be implied in the details supplied with the question. <\/p>  <p>  Overall, the restrictions in tax expenditures and the funds raised by way of the levy have helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. We have begun to see the benefits of this improving position as evident from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the income tax burden on low and middle income earners. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700047#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700047#WRF01350"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[18069\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700047#WRF01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will explain the discrepancies in relation to value added tax being charged by telecommunication companies (details supplied).","asker":"1034","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.\u00a0 The reduced VAT rate of 13.5% applies to the supply of gas and electricity in Ireland.\u00a0 The majority of EU Member States apply a much higher VAT rate to the supply of gas and electricity as EU VAT law provides that the standard VAT rate should apply to these services. \u00a0However, as part of a derogation to EU VAT law, Ireland is entitled to retain a reduced rate to the supply of gas and electricity on the basis that we applied a reduced rate to the supply of domestic fuels on 1 January 1991.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Separately, in relation to telecommunication, internet and television broadcasting services provided by companies such as UPC or Vodafone, these services are subject to the standard rate of VAT which is 23% in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with section 37(1) of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, the amount on which VAT is chargeable is the total consideration receivable by the supplier, \"including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever\", but not including the VAT itself.\u00a0 This reflects EU VAT law, with which Irish tax law must comply.\u00a0 In this regard, Article 78 of the EU VAT Directive provides that the taxable amount shall include \"taxes, duties, levies and charges, excluding the VAT itself\".<\/p>  <p>  In this respect, where the charge for a supply of service, such as an electricity bill, includes the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy, VAT law dictates that VAT should be calculated on the PSO levy element of the charge as well as the charge for the service.\u00a0 The same situation applies in respect of a service charge on other bills as outlined by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700047#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Increment Payments","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700047#WRF01550"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[18070\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700047#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost to the Exchequer of the payment of increments to all public sector staff under his remit, per year, since 2008.","asker":"1034","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>I wish to inform the Deputy that the calculation of increments is a matter for the Payroll Shared Service Centre, who have informed me that because of the variables involved i.e. payees starting and leaving, staff moving on\/off sick pay, staff changing worksharing patterns, etc. it is virtually impossible to provide an answer to this Parliamentary Question.<\/p>  <p>  However my Officials are calculating figures based on an average of an increment per grade and the number of increments paid each year in my Department.

In 2014 export volumes increased by approximately 7%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values increased by some 3% and are in the range of &euro;570 million, continuing the growth seen in recent years. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices and production followed by recovery. My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure in recent months and the difficulties that this is causing for producers. Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices remain above the EU average at present. However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I called on the European Commission to monitor the developments on markets and where necessary, to quickly activate safety net provisions such as public interventions and\/or private storage aid. This resulted in the introduction of the Aids to Private Storage scheme for the pigmeat sector which opened in early March of this year. However due to the fact that EU pigmeat market prices stabilised somewhat over recent weeks and the uptake of the scheme by operators dropped to minimal volumes, the Commission closed the scheme as of last week.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Russian ban on EU pigmeat exports, I am fully aware of the concerns Irish pig farmers have as a result of the closure of this market. My Department has met with the Russian authorities on a number of occasions to impress upon them the importance we attach to the normalisation of trade with Russia. Ultimately however, the Russian ban on pigmeat is an EU wide issue and is likely only to be resolved at EU level. The Commission has referred this matter to the WTO for resolution.<\/p>  <p>  Support is provided by my Department for the pig sector in a number of ways. Firstly I have included provision in the Rural Development Programme for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors. Some &euro;37 million has been allocated for 2015. \u00a0Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.\u00a0Other elements of the RDP, such as a targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector.<\/p>  <p>  Other supports for the sector come through Teagasc which, through its Moorepark pig research facility and courses in pig production, plays an important role in improving production at farm level. Through its Joint Research Advisory Programme, Teagasc supports Irish pig producers by providing advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The programme which is funded by a voluntary industry levy has enabled Teagasc to employ four additional advisors and researchers to support producers and the sector through advice, research and education across a range of issues of importance to the sector. The high level objective of the programme is to enhance the sustainability of Irish pig meat production, including improvements in economic, social and environmental standards. This will result in improvements in the production and marketability of Irish pigmeat.<\/p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the need to promote the consumption of Irish pigmeat in domestic and overseas markets. Bord Bia provides assistance to the pigmeat sector through its marketing and promotional activities, and the pigmeat quality assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.<\/p>  <p>  For my part I have undertaken to ensure that as many alternative markets as possible are open to Irish Pigmeat processors since the closure of the Russian market last year. In this regard I was pleased to announce the opening of the markets in Vietnam and the Philippines for Irish pigmeat which will serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports. My Department will continue in its efforts to develop access to international markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700049#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Eligibility","counter":244,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700049#WRH00750"},{"type":"question","counter":245,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[18074\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700049#WRH00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if farmers whose mountain land is accidentally burnt before 15 May in any year will be eligible for payment under the basic farm payment scheme and the greening scheme on the basis of force majeure in that year; to set out the situation that would arise if a third party, without the permission of the land holders, started a fire on the land; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":246,"content":"<p>All applicants under the Basic Payment Scheme, the Greening Payment and other area based schemes are obliged to comply with the EU Regulatory requirements on land eligibility.

Anyone ordinarily resident in the country is entitled, subject to certain charges, to receive public in-patient and out-patient hospital services. People who do not take out health insurance continue to have the same entitlement to services in the public hospital system.<\/p>  <p>  Community rating, reflecting the principle of intergenerational solidarity, is a fundamental cornerstone of the health insurance system. This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more than the young and well.  Under community rating, the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid.  Premiums for younger or healthier lives are typically higher than their expected claims would require, whereas for older or less healthy lives, premiums are typically lower than the expected claims would require. <\/p>  <p>  For Community Rating to work we depend on adequate numbers of younger people taking out health insurance to help keep premium prices down for everybody. Lifetime Community Rating is being introduced to encourage people to take out health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across society, to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance. It is a necessary measure to help support the viability of community rating within our system of health insurance.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth clarifying that those who do not wish to avail of private health insurance will not face a financial penalty. They retain their full entitlement to use of public hospital services. Under Lifetime Community Rating, those who decide to take out  health insurance later in life will face an added premium compared to those who have subscribed over a longer period.  I am satisfied that this measure is fully justified for the purposes of maintaining a stable insurance market which provides equity of treatment between young and old.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700052#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700052#WRL01950"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[17944\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700052#WRL02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when it is proposed to restore the rheumatology outreach clinic in Letterkenny General Hospital in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1000","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

In outlining the importance of such quality assurance structures and functions, the Faculty explained that \"like many diagnostic services that involved decision making under conditions of uncertainty, a certain degree of error is inevitable\".  The challenge to every system internationally is to ensure systems are put in place to mitigate risk, minimise the degree of error and provide assurance around the services provided.<\/p>  <p>  The process of audit is built into radiology practice.  Peer review occurs continuously: radiologists review older images when reporting on new images.  In addition, radiology departments partake in multidisciplinary team meetings, where images are reviewed by teams who decide on the treatment a patient should receive.  In line with the recommendations of the NQAPR, many departments hold discrepancy meetings, with open discussion of cases where reports appear to be inaccurate.  Such meetings facilitate collective learning, improving patient safety.  Prospective double reporting is where a consultant radiologist seeks a second opinion from another consultant radiologist within his or her department on a particular case prior to authorisation.<\/p>  <p>  Radiological services will be improved through the implementation of Hospital Groups.  Within Groups, a networked approach will be adopted, allowing the major centres to direct and manage services.  This will ensure that appropriate and enhanced governance and staffing arrangements are in place.  The full implementation of the National Integrated Medical Imaging System (NIMIS) which provides filmless imaging data and enhances the secure and rapid movement of patient image data throughout the health service including across hospitals within Hospital Groups is continuing to enhance radiological services nationally.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, new structures have been created in the HSE and in my Department to advance patient safety and clinical effectiveness.  The creation of a Quality Improvement Division within the HSE and the Clinical Programmes set up between the HSE and the RCPI, have greatly enhanced our governance and capacity for ensuring robust quality and risk frameworks, developing models of best practice in clinical care.  The establishment and strengthening of the Clinical Effectiveness Unit in my Department has been fundamental to reducing risk and improving the performance of our health system.  I fully support this clinical effectiveness agenda.  It is vital that Ireland has a suite of quality assured National Clinical Guidelines and National Clinical Audit in place.  These are standards for patient care and treatments set out by leading clinicians in the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700055#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[18012\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015050700055#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current status of the integrated medical imaging system; the number of hospitals that are part of this system; the number that are not part of this system; the timeframe within which he expects all hospitals to be part of this system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.

Work on the review of primary science will happen at a later stage since the review of all aspects of the primary curriculum is being done on a phased basis. <\/p>  <p>  In January this year, I launched the performance report on the 2014 National Assessments of English and Reading and Mathematics which was prepared by the Educational Research Centre.  Their study of 8000 pupils in 150 primary schools found that overall performance in reading and mathematics in second and sixth classes was significantly higher than for the 2009 assessments.  These are the first significant improvements in over 30 years. Such improvements are to be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  Significant system developments have been introduced in the primary school system to promote teaching and learning in Mathematics for boys and girls including standardised national assessments of reading and mathematics introduced in 2007.

Scoilnet is the Department of Education and Skills (DES) official portal for Irish education.  The website is managed by Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) in Education on behalf of the DES.  The Sci-Spy Initiative which is a section of this website is aimed at primary students in 5th and 6th classes.<\/p>  <p>  Science Week Ireland is an annual event established to promote the relevance of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) in our everyday lives.  It is coordinated by SFI Discover, the education-outreach programme of Science <\/p>  <p>  In relation to post-primary, Dr Travers, in his February report, recommended that implementation of Junior Cycle science be postponed from September 2015 to September 2016.  Currently over 90% of students take Junior Cycle science.  It is expected that the vast majority will continue to do so.  A range of comprehensive continuing professional development (CPD) will be provided for teachers of junior cycle science through the dedicated JCT service. <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA has provided me with new specifications for Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology.  The NCCA has notified the Department that before the specifications are made available to all schools that it, working with the SEC and my Department, will trial, in particular the proposed new practical examinations. <\/p>  <p>  Work is currently underway on revising Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science and Applied Mathematics. <\/p>  <p>  New syllabuses are in place at both junior and senior cycles for Mathematics, often called \"project mathematics\".  Since 2010, the Project Maths Development Team, www.projectmaths.ie, a support service funded by my Department provides a range of professional development supports including workshops, and resources for 6,000 post-primary teachers of mathematics across the country. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, the Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching, a blended learning, two year part-time programme Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching has been made available nationwide and free of charge, to assist 'out-of-field' teachers to acquire skills for effective mathematics teaching and to register with the Teaching Council as teachers of mathematics at post-primary level.

Processing times for mediation cases are typically 10 to 12 weeks.<\/p><p>The PRTB, as an independent statutory body, will adjudicate each dispute on its own facts and merits and may grant redress and give specific direction as appropriate on foot of a determination order.  Receipt of a determination order is the official notification to parties of the final outcome of a dispute resolution case.  The order sets out the terms to be complied with, including any payments owing and the length of time given to comply.

However, while there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders seriously.  During 2013, it referred 394 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order.  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and more particularly, recoupment of an award.
