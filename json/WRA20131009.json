In light of these objectives my Department's strategy is to:<\/p><p>- improve the design of PMDS and streamline the PMDS process; and <\/p><p>- work with management across the Civil Service to strengthen the operation of PMDS. <\/p><p>  The PMDS process will be significantly streamlined by the introduction of an electronic PMDS system &ndash; ePMDS - to make the completion of PMDS forms possible online.  My Department is working to develop this system at present so that, in January 2014, it will &quot;go live&quot; for those Departments that have moved to PeoplePoint - the new HR Shared Service Centre for the Civil Service.<\/p><p>  The Phase 2 changes, agreed in July 2012 by my Department, together with management of the Civil Service and the unions, are being introduced for the current 2013 cycle.  These changes seek to address issues concerning  the perceived lack of fairness and consistency in the application of PMDS.  The most important of the changes in Phase 2 is the introduction of a formal system of calibration for the review of performance.  The process involves managers at the same grade-level meeting to discuss the performance of their jobholders with the aim of making sure that they apply similar standards for all jobholders and it should help to ensure greater balance and consistency in the award of ratings.<\/p><p>  My Department has also implemented other changes to the system aimed at improving fairness and consistency, including:<\/p><p>- A new grade-based Competency Framework has been introduced, together with a revised rating scale with improved descriptions of performance levels. <\/p><p>- A more comprehensive process of internal review of ratings, and access to external review, are under way.  The revised review procedures are being actively advanced with a view to early discussions with management and unions in the Civil Service so that these too will be in place for the final stages of the 2013 cycle.<\/p><p>- Finally, a rating of &quot;Fully Achieved Expectations&quot; is required for the award of an increment.<\/p><p>  Turning to the take-up of additional training courses across Departments as a result of PMDS reviews, this is a matter for each individual Department and Office on the basis of its own assessment of training and development needs.  My Department expects to have more detailed and comprehensive information available on take-up of training and development opportunities in the context of Learning and Development Shared Services Project which is currently under way. <\/p><p>  Progress is being made in renewing PMDS.  In 2012, compliance with PMDS rose to 85% - the highest level to date - up from 77% in 2011.  My Department will continue to work with all managers across the system to continue to ensure full compliance with PMDS as part of an overall focus on strengthening managerial performance.  A particular focus of attention for 2013 is the distribution of ratings with the aim of achieving a distribution of ratings that more accurately reflects performance across the system.  Although there has been some movement towards greater alignment with the expected statistical distribution, there remains relatively high levels of awards of the higher categories of ratings overall and very low levels of ratings in respect of underperformance. <\/p><p>  A key challenge for senior leadership across the Civil Service is to demonstrate their own commitment to delivering a high performance culture and to fully engage line managers in the management and improvement of performance.  My Department will continue to review how we manage performance in the Civil Service and on the basis of this we will continue to make changes aimed at improving PMDS as it is the primary tool for managing performance in the Civil Service.  My Department is committed to the ongoing strengthening of performance management to enable people to achieve their potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900060#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies Numbers","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900060#WRB00450"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[42294\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900060#WRB00500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the level of rationalisation of State bodies undertaken since the Government came into office to date.","asker":"1020","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":22,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[42486\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900060#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the reduction in the number of State boards and agencies; the savings that will be achieved from this in 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":23,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 22 together.<\/p><p>  As the Deputies are aware, the rationalisation of State bodies is a key deliverable of the Public Service Reform Plan.  My Department is currently monitoring the implementation of the measures on a quarterly basis.  The latest tables which detail this progress to end Quarter 3 2013 can be found on my Department's website.  In summary, the tables show that significant progress has been made by Departments on implementation.  To date, rationalisation and amalgamation measures involving 44 bodies have been fully implemented, most recently the abolition of the VECs, which were replaced by a much smaller number of Education and Training Boards.  Measures involving a further 63 bodies are at advanced legislative or administrative stages.  <\/p><p>  Further measures, involving 109 bodies, were identified under a critical review process undertaken in 2012 as part of the Public Service Reform Plan and are currently being implemented.  The Public Service Reform Plan aims to secure &euro;20 million in enhanced service efficiencies and value-for-money from the rationalisation programme, a target that will be achieved.  The bulk of the savings are derived from a reduction in the number of public servants working in the merged entities and from other administrative efficiencies<b>. <\/b><\/p><p>  From the outset I have maintained that the lasting and most important benefit from the rationalisation of State Bodies will be a less crowded administrative landscape, resulting in greater democratic accountability, less duplication of effort and clearer lines of responsibility for the citizen.  Moreover, the rationalisation programme needs to be understood as just one of a package of reform measures that will allow for the continued delivery of critical services against the backdrop of reducing public service numbers.  There will of course be other cash savings realised over time as organisations, financial systems, office accommodation etc. are rationalised into leaner, more coherent structures.  These savings, some of which will be once-off, will be factored into the overall budgetary framework as they arise.  <\/p><p>  Within my own area of control the Commission on Public Service Appointments was merged into the Office of the Ombudsman with effect from October 2012.

The OGP is a global multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.  It is overseen by a multi-stakeholder International Steering Committee consisting of Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, Tanzania, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as civil society representatives.<\/p><p>  Recognising the critical importance of the full participation of civil society interests in this process, proposals for inclusion in the action plan were discussed at three public meetings of a network of civil society and other interests held over the summer months, as well as through online contributions.

","asker":"1022","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>Reform of public procurement is one of the major projects of key strategic importance in the Government's Public Service Reform Plan. Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum. This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.<\/p><p>  In this regard, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the review, which was published in late last year, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model. The report estimates that implementation of its recommendations, over a three-year period, could yield potential annual savings in the range of &euro;249 million to &euro;637 million on an addressable spend of &euro;7 billion, depending on the approach taken.<\/p><p>  In order to realise these benefits the National Procurement Service has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service's buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include:<\/p><p>- cash savings; <\/p><p>- administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering; <\/p><p>- greater purchasing expertise; <\/p><p>- improved consistency; and,<\/p><p>- enhanced service levels. <\/p><p>  In relation to plans for further reform of public procurement, the review also found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model. In December 2012, arising out of recommendations in the review of the central procurement function the Minister announced the appointment of a Chief Procurement Officer to lead a key element of the Government's Public Service Reform agenda. The new approach to public procurement will involve:<\/p><p>- integrating procurement policy, strategy and sourcing in one office;<\/p><p>- strengthening spend analytics and data management;<\/p><p>- much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money;<\/p><p>- examining the specifications set out for goods and services;<\/p><p>- evaluating demand levels to assess how demand and volume can be reduced; and<\/p><p>- strengthening supplier and category management.<\/p><p>  Since the appointment of the Chief Procurement Officer on 28 January 2013, he has initiated and completed a series of engagements (workshops and one-to-one meetings) with key stakeholders within the public sector and their representatives in relation to the development of the proposed governance structures, implementation plan, transition arrangements and savings targets for the procurement function. The following sectors were engaged in workshops \/ meetings: Health, Education, Local Government, Defence, Justice, and other Central Government Departments.<\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the National Procurement Service, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the National Procurement Service has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the National Procurement Service also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.<\/p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend and we want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900063#WRE00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":87,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900063#WRE00550"},{"type":"question","counter":88,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[42501\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900063#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the State can secure further savings in respect of legal fees across Government Departments and State agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. <\/p><p>  I am aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Current guidelines (Circular 10\/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of SMEs in the award of public contracts. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:<\/p><p>- supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.etenders.gov.ie<\/font><\/i>   website;<\/p><p>- less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;<\/p><p>- ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;<\/p><p>- sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.<\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the National Procurement Service, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.

Parallel with these events the National Procurement Service also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.<\/p><p>  The National Procurement Service is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;130,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;200,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;400,000. On average 5000 tenders for the procurement of goods, services and works are advertised on eTenders every year. I am informed by the National Procurement Service that the latest information available relates to 2010. In that year, the National Procurement Service estimates that approximately 5% of the overall spend went to non-domestic suppliers.<\/p><p>  The importance of procurement policy becomes apparent when one sees that each year public authorities across the European Union spend 19% of GDP or approximately &euro;2.4 trillion on goods, services and works. In this context, it is important to realise that the open market regime offers critical opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad. In this regard, Enterprise Ireland and Intertrade Ireland offer training and support to businesses in order to raise awareness of public procurement opportunities and to improve the capacity of indigenous firms to compete effectively for these opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900063#WRE01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Lottery Licence Sale","counter":97,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900063#WRE01250"},{"type":"question","counter":98,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[42513\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900063#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the impact the legal proceedings initiated by The Rehab Group and Rehab Lotteries will have on the tendering process of the new national lottery licence.","asker":"1008","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":99,"content":"<p>I received correspondence some months ago on behalf of Rehab Lotteries which gave notice of its intention to challenge the State regarding the establishment and operation of the National Lottery on competition grounds.

I would also call on the Russian authorities to ensure that the activists receive the legal and consular assistance to which they are entitled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900065#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid Issues","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900065#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[42669\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900065#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his position on Ireland's aid commitments in Budget 2014; if he will ensure that Budget 2014 meets Ireland's commitments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These very significant allocations of public funds clearly demonstrate that we have consolidated the development assistance budget - a major achievement in light of the very difficult fiscal conditions facing the Government.

These include representing and advancing government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic, trade  and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.  The figures in the tables below include expenditure charged to mission budgets.  Salary and related costs of staff posted from Ireland are not included as they are a charge on the overall budget of the Department rather than on a specific mission.  Local staff salaries in missions abroad are reflective of the prevailing labour market conditions in the host country.  Capital expenditure is not included as such expenditure does not form part of the Mission&rsquo;s budget.  For ease of reference, the figures provided have been separated into Vote 28 Foreign Affairs and Trade and Vote 27 International Cooperation.  The costs of a number of missions that manage significant programmes on behalf of Irish Aid are charged to Vote 27.  The effective implementation of the aid programmes necessarily entails additional management and oversight costs which are included in the figures provided below.  In addition to 25 locally recruited core staff, in the region of 180 locally-employed staff are engaged on the development cooperation side to meet technical requirements in specific programme areas.  The numbers of such staff in each mission at any time varies in accordance with programme requirements.<\/p><p><bu>Table I Vote 28 Mission Budgets 2009-2013 - All figures in Euro<\/bu><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Mission<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013 <br \/>(to Oct 7) provisional<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Berne<\/td><td>427,988<\/td><td>429,447<\/td><td>499,593<\/td><td>494,120<\/td><td>350,546<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Berlin<\/td><td>1,021,130<\/td><td>907,409<\/td><td>926,903<\/td><td>913,175<\/td><td>687,680<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Boston<\/td><td>373,100<\/td><td>377,114<\/td><td>359,624<\/td><td>322,655<\/td><td>276,833<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Brussels (Embassy incl.PfP)<\/td><td>1,132,756<\/td><td>816,501<\/td><td>799,662<\/td><td>865,955<\/td><td>522,728<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Brussels (Permanent Representation to the EU)<\/td><td>3,312,397<\/td><td>3,322,071<\/td><td>3,358,265<\/td><td>3,475,453<\/td><td>3,007,136<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Buenos Aires<\/td><td>372,902<\/td><td>438,541<\/td><td>415,840<\/td><td>389,242<\/td><td>245,222<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cairo<\/td><td>396,525<\/td><td>382,190<\/td><td>423,531<\/td><td>449,905<\/td><td>314,115<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Canberra<\/td><td>659,319<\/td><td>760,935<\/td><td>746,570<\/td><td>814,655<\/td><td>570,560<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chicago<\/td><td>326,566<\/td><td>345,200<\/td><td>341,645<\/td><td>310,363<\/td><td>251,385<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Copenhagen<\/td><td>423,347<\/td><td>400,517<\/td><td>383,102<\/td><td>371,804<\/td><td>290,903<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Geneva<\/td><td>1,075,171<\/td><td>1,158,745<\/td><td>1,262,958<\/td><td>1,282,415<\/td><td>967,805<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Hague<\/td><td>652,976<\/td><td>741,184<\/td><td>652,113<\/td><td>698,164<\/td><td>491,815<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Abuja<\/td><td>290,016<\/td><td>278,241<\/td><td>252,983<\/td><td>578,891<\/td><td>234,939<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lisbon<\/td><td>376,881<\/td><td>347,406<\/td><td>427,883<\/td><td>378,173<\/td><td>283,960<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>London (Includes PPO London)<\/td><td>3,807,568<\/td><td>3,448,547<\/td><td>3,064,169<\/td><td>3,082,408<\/td><td>1,821,250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Luxembourg<\/td><td>692,201<\/td><td>687,546<\/td><td>387,042<\/td><td>390,796<\/td><td>279,958<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Madrid<\/td><td>1,192,169<\/td><td>1,073,062<\/td><td>971,018<\/td><td>948,846<\/td><td>715,302<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Moscow<\/td><td>759,994<\/td><td>758,895<\/td><td>731,157<\/td><td>747,034<\/td><td>589,501<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>New Delhi<\/td><td>474,056<\/td><td>743,338<\/td><td>668,436<\/td><td>625,499<\/td><td>784,319<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>New York -

These targets have been identified by the relevant Departments and the State Agencies under their aegis.  In overseas markets, my Department and our Embassy network work very closely with the State Agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland.  In the twenty seven priority overseas markets identified under the Strategy, Local Market Teams chaired by the Ambassador and including the State Agencies present in the particular market have been established to drive the common effort towards the achievement of the identified targets.  Local Market Plans drawn up by these teams are reviewed by the Export Trade Council which I chair and which includes the relevant Ministers as well as the CEOs of the State Agencies and members from the private sector.  The work of my Department and the Embassy network in engaging with key political and business figures in overseas markets, and on economic messaging designed to enhance confidence in our economic recovery, contributes directly to the achievement of the growth in domestic employment, as does the ongoing extensive support given by our Embassies to the trade missions organised by the State Agencies.  This year our Embassies will support a total of eighteen Ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions involving Irish companies, as well as a range of other overseas Ministerial visits focussed on driving job growth at home through building our international trading and investment opportunities, in both mature and high growth markets.  Each year the St. Patrick's Day period provides a particular focus for our efforts to support job creation in the domestic economy and the Embassy network exploits to the full all the opportunities it provides for Ministerial led missions and other economic, business and cultural activity.<\/p><p>  The Global Irish Network established by my Department is also contributing its ideas and support to the drive for jobs and I am pleased to note that at the most recent meeting of the Global Irish Economic Forum in Dublin Castle last weekend there was a very positive interaction at an Enterprise Ireland industry event between the Irish SME sector and the network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900065#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900065#WRG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[43036\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900065#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reduction in public expenditure numbers that will be achieved in 2013 and 2014 from targeted redundancy and early retirement in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>To date, a total of eighteen age-related retirements have taken place in 2013 in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Such companies are obliged to file a corporation tax return in respect of their Irish branch operations; however, the return does not require them to provide their country of residence for tax purposes.  <\/p><p>  While non-resident companies within the charge to Irish corporation tax are not required to indicate their country of residence in their annual corporation tax return, section 882 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (which was introduced in Finance Act 1999) requires companies incorporated in the State to provide certain particulars to Revenue within 30 days of commencing to carry on a business. Particulars to be provided include the company&rsquo;s name, registered address, place of business, date of commencement of the business and, in the case of a company not resident in the State, the name of the territory in which it is tax resident.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that newly incorporated companies coming within the charge to Irish corporation tax are registered with Revenue for tax purposes. <\/p><p>  While there is no specific penalty for failing to provide a country of residence in the statement of particulars, a company that fails to deliver a statement of particulars under section 882 is liable to a penalty of &euro;4,000, with provision for a further penalty of &euro;60 for each day on which the failure continues after a court judgement has been obtained. <\/p><p>  There is no requirement in Irish tax law for a company to claim or obtain authorisation of non-resident status from Revenue and statistics on the number of Irish registered non-resident companies are not separately compiled. As a result, Revenue does not have an estimate of the number of such companies, the numbers of such companies by country of residence or the number of such companies that have not declared a country of residence. Nonetheless, Revenue as part of its normal compliance activity seeks confirmation from companies from time to time as to how they are structured with a view to ensuring that all relevant corporation tax rules are correctly applied.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900067#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Expenditure Statistics","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900068#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[43035\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900068#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reduction in public expenditure numbers that will be achieved in 2013 and 2014 from targeted redundancy and early retirement in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>My Department is not in a position to provide details of the reduction in numbers as there is no targeted redundancy or early retirement scheme available to staff in my Department.

In relation to SNA contracts, the position is that the standard contract for SNAs was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005.  This standard contract has not been amended recently nor are there any current plans to amend the standard SNA contract.<\/p><p>  In that context, the position on working hours for SNAs is that there are no nationally set working hours for full-time SNAs.  The working week for SNAs is defined in paragraph 2.5 of their contract as follows: &quot;You will be required to work normal classroom hours including class break periods and in addition to attend before and after school in order to help with the preparation and tidying up of classrooms, reception and dispersal of children etc.  The hours of work will normally be from [xxxx] to [xxxx] daily during term time.&quot;<\/p><p>  This standard contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead, full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.<\/p><p>  In relation to the suggestion that the agreed working hours\/working week for an SNA should be altered and-or that there is a policy of wage curtailment being pursued in respect of SNAs the position is as follows.  The Deputy will be aware that a new set of proposals for a public service agreement were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement). Two of the key aspects of this Agreement relate to working hours for all public servants and remuneration, increments and related balancing measures.  The measures in respect of remuneration, increments and related balancing measures for SNAs were given effect in DES Circular 34\/2013 which issued on 27 June 2013 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address:  <\/p><p>  The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:<blockquote>SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS Hours Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant. Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited. Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013\/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT\/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.  This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.<\/blockquote>As the LRC proposals which formed the Haddington Road Agreement are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement.  If an individual SNA has a dispute over their salary, and if they are a Department paid SNA, then in the first instance they should raise the matter directly with the NTS Payroll section of my Department who have responsibility for the payment of SNAs on the Departmental payroll.  An SNA employed by an Education and Training Board should raise the matter directly with their own employer.<\/p><p>  In respect of the point made regarding overpayments of salary the position is that such overpayments occur for numerous reasons and the recoupment of overpayments is dealt with in line with my Department's published policy and procedures for dealing with Overpayments of Salary (DES circular 15\/04 which is available on the Department's website at the following address ).  The occurrence of overpayments is avoidable and with co-operation, the inconvenience caused to staff members in such situations can be alleviated. It is acknowledged that it may not always be possible for school management-staff members to provide the Department with the required written notification in advance. In that instance, it should be possible to contact the Department directly - by phone or e-mail; thereby lessening the risk of the staff member concerned being overpaid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900069#WRL00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[42652\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900069#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will examine the contracts of special needs assistants whose pay has been reduced due to their post now being considered a percentage of a full post of 32 hours per week; and if he will initiate reforms to end this practice.","asker":"1015","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to support children with special educational needs.

Current guidelines (Circular 10\/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of SMEs in the award of public contracts. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:<\/p><p>- supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.etenders.gov.ie<\/font><\/i>   website;<\/p><p>- less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;<\/p><p>- ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract; and<\/p><p>- sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.<\/p><p>  My Department is keen to streamline procurement processes - consistent with its value for money, legal, transparency and probity objectives. In order to reduce the costs involved in participating or conducting the procurement process, the National Procurement Service as part of the new Office of Government Procurement is promoting standardisation and simplification of the public procurement function.  It has published a suite of model tendering and contract documents which will help both businesses and buyers to reduce administrative costs.  <\/p><p>  In addition my Department has developed contracts for Public Works and Construction-Related Services that give greater cost certainty at tender stage, for capital projects. The construction reform initiative has yielded substantial savings in capital procurement.  <\/p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the National Procurement Service, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 4,500 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900071#WRN00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Increment Payments","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900071#WRN00550"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":94,"qnumall":"[42611\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900071#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the gross value of all increments to be paid to civil and public servants in 2014, and the percentage average increase-decrease in salaries in 2014 factoring in increments and the cuts imposed as part of the Haddington Road agreement.

Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum.  This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the Public Service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.<\/p><p>  In this regard, an external review of the central procurement function was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The report of the review, which was published in late last year, found that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of a transformational change to the central procurement model.

These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes. The Group is currently examining the issue of working age supports, including in-work supports such as FIS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900076#WRS00500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domiciliary Care Allowance Appeals","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900076#WRS00550"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[42648\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900076#WRS00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will expedite a domiciliary care appeal in respect of a person (details supplied).","asker":"1065","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all of the available evidence, has decided to allow the appeal of the person concerned by way of a summary decision.

The purpose of the plan is to provide the ability to explore whether there are any other options available for those sites where relocation is genuinely not possible. It also indicates how the 53 SACs are to be restored and managed into the future, which will be done in full consultation and partnership with those who own the bogs and surrounding land owners.&quot;<\/blockquote>  For the avoidance of all doubt, what is being conducted at the moment is a scientific survey. Comments in the local media from some parties about a risk of flooding arising from this simple scientific survey are unfounded.

","asker":"1071","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 to 186, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Water fluoridation and the use of appropriate fluorides is a major plank of public health policy in Ireland in the prevention and management of tooth decay.  In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. <\/p><p>  Fluoride may be added to public water supplies either in the form of hydrofluosilicic acid complying with the specifications for that substance in Schedule 1 to the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007 (SI 42 of 2007) or in such other form as may be approved by the Minister.  Chemifloc Ltd. is the company contracted by the HSE for the supply and delivery of hydrofluosilicic acid for the purpose of water fluoridation.  Fluoride is sourced as a primary product in Spain, mined directly from a raw material source - the mineral fluorospar.  It goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce hydrofluosilicic acid, specifically used as the mineral additive, fluoride, to water.  This process is conducted by a company in Spain - Derivados del Fluor.  The fluoride is added to the public water supplies at water treatment plants throughout the country by the local authorities acting as agents for the health authorities as provided for in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960.<\/p><p>  The Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007 requires that a daily test is carried out at water treatment plants by the local authority water services staff to determine fluoride content.  Monthly fluoride testing is carried out by the HSE and the Environmental Protection Agency also carries out testing which requires monitoring of fluoride levels in water supplies. <\/p><p>  Some European countries use an alternative systemic approach to fluoridation such as salt fluoridation or milk fluoridation in their public health programmes.  Others use fluoride mouth-rinses and\/or tooth-brushing or painting of teeth with fluorides.  Additionally, all European countries promote the widespread use of fluoride toothpastes. <\/p><p>  The USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia actively fluoridate water supplies.  Over 204 million people (approximately 66% of the population) in the USA receive fluoridated water with coverage having increased by around 24 million people between 2002 and 2012.<\/p><p>  No claim associating water fluoridation at the optimal level with negative health effects has been substantiated.  A known side effect at this level is enamel fluorosis, which is a cosmetic or aesthetic condition which refers to the way teeth look and is generally easy to treat.  This is in contrast to the treatment of tooth decay which may on occasion involve the use of general anaesthesia and hospitalisation.  Fluorosis has been rigorously monitored in Ireland and changes in fluorosis levels were responded to by lowering the levels of fluoride in water from 2007 and advising on the appropriate use of fluoride toothpaste. <\/p><p>  The European Commission Report 2011 to which the Deputy refers is presumably the Report of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER). It states that a narrow margin exists in children between achieving the beneficial effects of fluoride in reducing dental decay and the potential adverse effect of dental fluorosis.  This is true regardless of the source of fluoride, whether from water fluoridation or other sources, such as ingested toothpaste.  The maximum fluoride concentration allowed in fluoridated water in Ireland is 0.8 mg\/l.  The SCHER conclusions derive from concentrations exceeding 0.8mg\/l; 1.5mg\/l and 3mg\/l.  It cannot be inferred from these conclusions that children here are exposed to unsafe doses of fluoride on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  The impact of water fluoridation on caries levels in Ireland has been regularly assessed in both national and local surveys since its introduction in the mid 1960s.  The national studies which have been undertaken are Children's Dental Health in Ireland 1984; Oral Health of Irish Adults 1989-1990; Oral Health of Irish Adults 2000-2002; North South Survey of Children's Oral Health 2002.  In addition, regional studies were undertaken in the 1990s and a cross border study in 2006.  All show a substantial benefit of fluoride in terms of a reduction in tooth decay.  At present a research project &quot;Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth &quot; (FACCT) is being conducted by the Oral Health Services Research Centre, University College Cork and supported by the HSE. <\/p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, continuously monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by major international scientifically validated reviews.  The effects of fluoride on health and related matters are kept under constant review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900081#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900081#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[42555\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900081#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the legislative basis for placing a person of unsound mind in a group home; the basis for setting charges relating to the care of such a person; the procedures used to ensure the proper and accountable management of the person's financial resources.

","asker":"1071","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":644,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 to 186, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Water fluoridation and the use of appropriate fluorides is a major plank of public health policy in Ireland in the prevention and management of tooth decay.  In 2002 the Forum on Fluoridation, which was established to review this policy, concluded that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. <\/p><p>  Fluoride may be added to public water supplies either in the form of hydrofluosilicic acid complying with the specifications for that substance in Schedule 1 to the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007 (SI 42 of 2007) or in such other form as may be approved by the Minister.  Chemifloc Ltd. is the company contracted by the HSE for the supply and delivery of hydrofluosilicic acid for the purpose of water fluoridation.  Fluoride is sourced as a primary product in Spain, mined directly from a raw material source - the mineral fluorospar.  It goes through a purification process to conform to tightly controlled specifications under the requirements of CEN Standard I.S.EN 12175:2001 to produce hydrofluosilicic acid, specifically used as the mineral additive, fluoride, to water.  This process is conducted by a company in Spain - Derivados del Fluor.  The fluoride is added to the public water supplies at water treatment plants throughout the country by the local authorities acting as agents for the health authorities as provided for in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960.<\/p><p>  The Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007 requires that a daily test is carried out at water treatment plants by the local authority water services staff to determine fluoride content.  Monthly fluoride testing is carried out by the HSE and the Environmental Protection Agency also carries out testing which requires monitoring of fluoride levels in water supplies. <\/p><p>  Some European countries use an alternative systemic approach to fluoridation such as salt fluoridation or milk fluoridation in their public health programmes.  Others use fluoride mouth-rinses and\/or tooth-brushing or painting of teeth with fluorides.  Additionally, all European countries promote the widespread use of fluoride toothpastes. <\/p><p>  The USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Israel, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia actively fluoridate water supplies.  Over 204 million people (approximately 66% of the population) in the USA receive fluoridated water with coverage having increased by around 24 million people between 2002 and 2012.<\/p><p>  No claim associating water fluoridation at the optimal level with negative health effects has been substantiated.  A known side effect at this level is enamel fluorosis, which is a cosmetic or aesthetic condition which refers to the way teeth look and is generally easy to treat.  This is in contrast to the treatment of tooth decay which may on occasion involve the use of general anaesthesia and hospitalisation.  Fluorosis has been rigorously monitored in Ireland and changes in fluorosis levels were responded to by lowering the levels of fluoride in water from 2007 and advising on the appropriate use of fluoride toothpaste. <\/p><p>  The European Commission Report 2011 to which the Deputy refers is presumably the Report of the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER). It states that a narrow margin exists in children between achieving the beneficial effects of fluoride in reducing dental decay and the potential adverse effect of dental fluorosis.  This is true regardless of the source of fluoride, whether from water fluoridation or other sources, such as ingested toothpaste.  The maximum fluoride concentration allowed in fluoridated water in Ireland is 0.8 mg\/l.  The SCHER conclusions derive from concentrations exceeding 0.8mg\/l; 1.5mg\/l and 3mg\/l.  It cannot be inferred from these conclusions that children here are exposed to unsafe doses of fluoride on a daily basis.<\/p><p>  The impact of water fluoridation on caries levels in Ireland has been regularly assessed in both national and local surveys since its introduction in the mid 1960s.  The national studies which have been undertaken are Children's Dental Health in Ireland 1984; Oral Health of Irish Adults 1989-1990; Oral Health of Irish Adults 2000-2002; North South Survey of Children's Oral Health 2002.  In addition, regional studies were undertaken in the 1990s and a cross border study in 2006.  All show a substantial benefit of fluoride in terms of a reduction in tooth decay.  At present a research project &quot;Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth &quot; (FACCT) is being conducted by the Oral Health Services Research Centre, University College Cork and supported by the HSE. <\/p><p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, continuously monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects.  It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population. The opinion of the Expert Body is supported by major international scientifically validated reviews.  The effects of fluoride on health and related matters are kept under constant review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900085#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":645,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900085#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":646,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[42555\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900085#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the legislative basis for placing a person of unsound mind in a group home; the basis for setting charges relating to the care of such a person; the procedures used to ensure the proper and accountable management of the person's financial resources.

Alternatively, it is also open to Kerry County Council to fund this project from its Discretionary Grant.<\/p><p>  It is also important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Kerry County Council in their own resources spending in this area and it is open to the Council to undertake this work from its own resources.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900088#WREE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":701,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900088#WREE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":702,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[42605\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900088#WREE01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will define the authority upon which State owned transport companies dispose of property assets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[42607\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013100900088#WREE01900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department requires State owned transport companies to consult with stakeholders before disposing of property assets or define properties in respect of their strategic, long term, infrastructure needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1045","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":704,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 and 208 together.<\/p><p>  The transport companies under my aegis are\u00a0the CI&Eacute; group of companies and the Railway Procurement Agency.
