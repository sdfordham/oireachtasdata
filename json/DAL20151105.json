There was an over-dependence on Part V private development.  When such development stopped, the dividend in the form of the delivery of social housing from that avenue also stopped.  We are now addressing the problem in that regard.

The target in the 2020 social housing strategy is for 110,000 social housing units to be provided by means of a mixture of direct provision by local authorities and approved housing bodies and indirect provision through the private rental market, mainly utilising the housing assistance payment.  This targeted provision will meet the needs of the 89,872 households nationally that were identified in the 2013 summary of social housing assessments as being qualified and in need of social housing support.  There is some flexibility for increased demand.  Some 46,584 households, or 52% of the those identified in the 2013 assessment, were found to be dependent on rent supplement, which was meant to be a short-term measure.  Over time, the housing assistance payment will provide a more suitable solution for those on rent supplement with a long-term housing need.<\/p>  <p>  In its analysis of the 2013 social housing assessments the Housing Agency concluded that 35,000 new social housing units would be required in the following five years.  The social housing strategy which provides for the delivery of these units has been supported in successive budgets.  Over &euro;1.7 billion in Exchequer and local authority self-funding has been allocated between 2015 and 2016.  The 2013 summary of assessments was compiled on foot of a rigorous and deep analysis which involved local authorities contacting individual households to confirm their continued requirement and qualification for social housing support.  It involved a comprehensive quality assurance exercise on the data, including the elimination of duplicate households.  It is not methodologically sound to compare this comprehensive data collection exercise with a snapshot of housing need in a given county at a point in time in 2015, as the Deputy has done.  I recognise that we need up-to-date and comprehensive data on housing need on an ongoing basis.  To ensure we have such information, the strategy includes a commitment to undertake housing assessments on an annual basis from 2016 onwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500005#C01100","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1446717000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has not answered my question about what has been commenced and completed this year.

A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing it on a number of fronts.  Construction 2020 is aimed at dealing with issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottleneck that might impede the sector in meeting demand is addressed.  It is being worked through constantly.  As the House knows, social housing has been prioritised by the Government, with more than &euro;1.7 billion in Exchequer and local authority self-funding allocated to the social housing strategy between the 2015 and 2016 budgets to support the provision of more than 33,000 units.  The &euro;4 billion social housing package for the entire country is the largest in the history of the State.  More than 200 sites are being developed.<\/p>  <p>  The key to addressing upward pressure on rents is an increase in the supply of public and private housing.  In 2014, the number of house completions was 11,016 nationally, an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure.  The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014.  As announced in budget 2016, NAMA aims to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these to be in the greater Dublin area.  This will be a positive contribution.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, I continue to work on proposals that address the issue of rising rents.

The strategy has been backed up by successive budgets, including this year, where social housing has been an absolute priority.  Budget 2015 included a provision of almost &euro;800 million to support a significant expansion in social housing provision, with more than 15,900 new units to be provided this year.  Budget 2016 builds on the investment with an Exchequer provision of almost &euro;811 million.\u00a0 In addition, local authorities will fund a range of housing services from their own resources to the value of over &euro;112 million, bringing the total housing provision in 2016 to &euro;923 million.  The &euro;4 billion strategy has been discussed numerous times in the House with regard to the targets in delivering 35,000 units through buying, building and leasing, with the balance of 75,000 to be delivered through the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.<\/p>  <p>  The priority which this Government has shown to providing significant increases in the financial resources for social housing provides clear evidence of our commitment to make very substantial progress in addressing our social housing challenge.  So far this year, this has allowed me to announce approximately &euro;500 million in capital funding for local authority and approved housing body projects and I expect to make further announcements in the coming days and weeks.  These projects will contribute to delivery in 2016 and when taken together with the broader range of housing programmes, I expect that over 17,000 housing units will be provided next year.  In addition, preparatory work will continue in 2016 on further new innovative projects, such as advancing the provision of 500 new social housing units through a public-private partnership programme and an affordable housing pilot scheme.

The investment will be in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes designed to accommodate more than 25% of those currently on local authority housing waiting lists.  In line with those targets, the Minister and I kick-started a major social housing construction programme as part of announcements of new local authority and approved housing body projects in May and July of this year.  These projects will see the delivery of more than 2,900 new housing units at a value of almost &euro;0.5 billion, covering all 31 local authorities.  We expect to be in a position to announce further approvals in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Given the time lag between approval and delivery of construction projects, as we have discussed, the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, as well as the remediation of vacant units or voids, are important components of social housing delivery this year.  In 2014, we turned around more than 2,000 voids.  The target for this year was 1,000, and we expect to exceed that substantially.  We have called on local authorities to come forward with their voids programmes, for which they will receive the necessary funding.  I cannot make it any clearer than that.<\/p>  <p>  Provisional data, largely to the end of the third quarter of 2015, indicate that a total of 1,411 units have been delivered through my Department's capital programmes, including build schemes and acquisitions and through returning voids to productive use.

I do not say that in any kind of glib way; I genuinely mean it.  There is a necessity to focus on providing suitable emergency accommodation for families.  The greatest concern is in respect of rough sleepers, which is particularly an issue in Dublin and other cities.  Yesterday, I launched the Be Winter Ready programme, assisted by the excellent work of Cathal Morgan and his team in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.<\/p>  <p>  We have brought forward a number of comprehensive action plans to tackle homelessness.  If the Deputy looks into it, he will see that virtually all of those plans have been executed and substantial progress has been made on their objectives.  Progress updates on all the action plans are brought on a monthly basis to the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy and public service reform.  Given the huge amount of work that is ongoing on a weekly and daily basis, I will not go through the 50 different actions.<\/p><p>Many of them have been successful.  The ministerial direction, which I presume the Deputy supported, in respect of the 50% increase in the allocations policy for people who are homeless or vulnerable has also been successful.  I refer to the public awareness campaigns, the work being done by Threshold and the possibility of increasing rent supplement payments.  Intercepting people who vulnerable is also working well.  The changes to the housing assistance payment, HAP, in respect of homeless families in Dublin were necessary measures.  Many different measures are required to meet the needs of people who are becoming homeless.  Everybody who is homeless has complex needs, either at a personal level or from an economic point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500008#F01950","answer":true,"speaker":"1088","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446719400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Housing is their first need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500009#G00200","speaker":"1190"},{"type":"speech","time":1446719400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Deputy Broughan, on your feet, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500009#G00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1446719400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>We are putting together measures across a whole range of areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500009#G00400","speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1446719400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

In this regard, account must be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines.

Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the wind guidelines.

NAMA is also funding the construction of new residential properties to help meet demand in the major urban centres.  Last year, NAMA funded nearly 50% of new housing output in Dublin despite having less than one third of residentially zoned development land in Dublin.  Since the start of 2014, NAMA has funded the construction of more than 2,000 new houses and apartments in the greater Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  In budget 2016, the Minister for Finance announced that NAMA, having carried out a review of residentially zoned sites under the control of its debtors and receivers, is aiming to fund the delivery of a target 20,000 additional new homes before the end of 2020.  This is in addition to NAMA's ongoing and central role in facilitating the delivery of new commercial and residential space in the Dublin dockland&rsquo;s strategic development zone.

I commend the fact that the Minister and his predecessor charged the national rural water services committee to look at this issue.  It is a question of funding.  I wish to make two final points.  It is quantifiable in the sense that these schemes have been in limbo since the cessation of CL&Aacute;R funding so this will not be a future multi-annual commitment.  There is a quantifiable number of schemes and these people are willing to pay for water.  Does that not mean something?  These people have spent thousands of euro trying to drill wells, pay for group water schemes and have companies in place.  One scheme has spent &euro;36,000 of the local people's own money and they are still without a water supply.

On the last occasion I told the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, that a lady telephoned me to say she was sick and cannot have anything whatsoever to do with the water.

Then, the Finance Bill 2012 was about cutbacks and reductions in services.  While there were positives at the time for the tourism sector, the potential and options for investment were much more limited than they are now.  It is great to be in a position where we can start giving back and putting money back into people&rsquo;s pockets.  It is not by accident that this has happened.  It has happened because of the decisions of the Government, including the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, and the sacrifices made by the people.  There has been a clear strategy to turn the country around.<\/p>  <p>  The Finance Bill 2015 contains significant measures which will improve the financial position of workers, pensioners and families across the country.  Several sections of the Bill will ensure every worker in the country will see an increase in his or her take-home pay and pension from January.  Section 2 gives effect to the budget announcements on the universal social charge, USC.  The Bill will again reduce it, continuing the work started last year.  It will exempt those on annual incomes of &euro;13,000 or less.  Income to &euro;12,012 will incur a reduced rate of 1%, down from 1.5%.  Income from &euro;12,012 to &euro;18,868 will incur a rate of 3%, down from 3.5%, while income from &euro;18,669 to &euro;70,044 will be charged at a rate of 5.5%, down from 7%.  USC is very much a despised tax which was introduced in emergency times.  While the emergency is not over, we are coming out of it.  Workers and pensioners have clearly illustrated to backbenchers their desire to see a change.  We brought this view to the Minister for Finance who, thankfully, is in a position to act on it.  It is a positive change which people will see in their pay packets and pensions from January 2016.<\/p>  <p>  With a general election approaching, it is important that the taxation plans of Opposition parties be scrutinised because they are the policies which Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and others will pursue if elected.  Fine Gael's measures to cut USC rates, as well as the increases in the thresholds for USC and inheritance tax, are in stark contrast to the Opposition's plans.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see a top rate of tax of 58%, an increase in employer's PRSI, which would make job creation more difficult, and an increase in inheritance tax.  With it, there would be no cut in USC for anyone earning more than &euro;19,500.  Fianna F&aacute;il's budget plans show that it is against the Government's tax cuts, instead preferring a top rate of tax of 52%.  Fianna F&aacute;il introduced USC in budget 2011, hitting anyone who earned over &euro;4,000.  Its proposed changes to USC bands would not benefit anyone earning over &euro;21,000.<\/p>  <p>  Section 3 which proposes an earned income tax credit is progressive.  During the difficult economic times many business owners worked without taking a wage for themselves.  This was to help to ensure the survival of the business, but it was exceptionally tough on the owners of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  It must be remembered that SMEs are responsible for two thirds of all the jobs created since 2012.  The tax system has not treated PAYE workers and the self-employed equally.  This disparity is unfair.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party are taking steps to equalise the tax system.  The &euro;550 earned income tax credit will benefit self-employed persons such as local business owners and farmers.  It is a first step towards equalisation and Fine Gael is committed to extending it in coming budgets, if returned to government.<\/p>  <p>  The treatment of the self-employed and the social welfare and disability benefits they receive need to be examined.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has taken steps in that regard in terms of stamp A contributions.  This is a welcome development which should be rolled out further.<\/p>  <p>  Another welcome measure which will help local businesses and stimulate job retention and creation is section 33.  It reduces the rate of capital gains tax from 33% to 20% up to a value of &euro;1 million where a business owner sells the business.  It is a practical measure which will incentivise the retention of a business as a going concern.<\/p>  <p>  Section 28 will extend until December 2018 the three-year corporation tax relief for start-up companies which was due to expire in December this year.  This measure exempts start-up companies from corporation tax for the first three years of trading.  The early years in business are often the most challenging and this measure will continue to provide support for important start-up companies, boosting their chances of success.<\/p>  <p>  The financial turbulence of recent years meant difficult choices had to be made which included revenue-raising measures, one of which was the raising of the threshold value for transferrals such as the inheritance of a home.  The impact of this measure was mitigated by falling house prices.<\/p><p>However, house prices have risen.  It was never the intention of the Government that an ordinary home being passed to a son or daughter would be subject to a higher rate.  Therefore, section 64 and the decision to increase the threshold from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000 is very welcome.  It is a measure which will benefit numerous families across my constituency and the country.<\/p> <p> Another issue that has been brought to my attention although it probably affects only a small number of people are sections 77 to 80 dealing with the disabled driver's fuel grant.  I received a communication from individuals regarding this grant and its impact.  A volunteer from the Galway Visually Impaired Activity Club who drives people who are visually impaired contacted me.  The van is registered in the name of the chairperson of that club, who is visually impaired.  Until now, it was taxed as a commercial van, with an annual road tax of &euro;333.  Recently he was told the van could no longer be taxed as a commercial vehicle as he did not have a business.  The club is considered more akin to a charity.  The lady in the tax office did her best to see if there was any way around this but the road tax bill increased to &euro;1,080.<\/p> <p> Revenue wrote to the club to say that the relevant legislation governing the scheme is contained in section 92 of the Finance Act 1992, as amended, and statutory instrument No. 353 of 1994, Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  It said that a fundamental requirement is that the organisation must qualify for the scheme and that a qualifying organisation means a philanthropic organisation that is not funded primarily by the State and which is chiefly engaged in a voluntary capacity, which this is.  Revenue said the legislation does not provide tax relief on vehicles used to transport persons with any disability other than those laid down in regulation No. 3.  In general, these include persons who are without the use of their hands, arms or legs or have the medical condition of dwarfism.  It does not include the visually impaired.  This is something that could be examined with the possibility of helping the group in Galway reduce its road tax.  The group is involved in transporting people and a reduction in the road tax would be of great benefit.<\/p> <p> The news in this Finance Bill is more positive than it has been in the past as is the capital expenditure side of the Budget Statement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have seen choices made to invest, including investment in our public services.  We saw teachers being recruited last year and again this year, which is welcome.  The huge challenges of demographic pressures are evident, in particular in our health services.  We have chosen to give something back to the hard-pressed taxpayer and pensioners as well as improving services.  This is not by accident but as a result of the decisions made and the sacrifices of the people.  I welcome the Bill and hope the Minister for Finance is around for future Finance Bills to ensure the progression of these measures and the continuity of the economic recovery of the past number of years.  I welcome the specific measures in this Bill which have improved people's situations.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister for Finance for the changes in respect of the commercial road tax.  The issue has been highlighted for a number of years by people who have been under pressure.  Companies were being registered in the North and the State was probably losing taxes but it was also driving business and jobs outside the country.  I welcome the proactive and pro-business measures in respect of the commercial road tax changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500011#J00400","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446721200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the debate on the Finance Bill.  This is the last Finance Bill before the general election and I pay tribute to the outgoing Minister for Finance for his stewardship of the Department.  He has played a central role in driving our economic transformation.  He pursued policies that restored sustainability to our public finances, improved our competitiveness and enhanced job creation.  It is no accident that we are currently the fastest growing economy in Europe and I commend the Minister for his dedication and work in the finance portfolio.<\/p>  <p>  We must continue to build on the progress that has already been achieved by adopting policies that will continue to support the prudent management of the public finances while at the same time ensuring the economic impact of the recovery is shared with the ordinary men and women who have made sacrifices to get this country back on its feet.  The first step was to reduce the universal social charge rates which will make a significant difference for people, especially low and middle-income earners.  For the first time in six years, the tax rate will fall below 50% and more than 700,000 of the lowest paid workers will be exempt from the universal social charge in January.  Those on lower incomes and the squeezed middle, as they are often described, have suffered during the crisis and reducing their tax liabilities is the best way of putting money back in their pockets.  This is probably just the beginning.  If we are re-elected, the next Government will continue to make those reductions.<\/p>  <p>  I speak to working families every week as they face the struggle in day to day life.  I do not understand our colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in.  They do not want to see cuts to the universal social charge.  Lower tax rates will strengthen job creation and consumer sentiment.  When a tax change increases a worker's take home pay, the worker has more disposable income which ultimately generates jobs in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the additional jobs created are in small businesses.  Small and medium enterprises are key to delivering jobs, in particular in rural areas.  It is important to support these SMEs.  I welcome the introduction of the earned income credit of &euro;550 which will apply for self-employed persons and the Minister's commitment to bridge the gap in tax treatment for the self-employed.  There are more than 300,000 self-employed taxpayers who did not receive a PAYE tax credit for whom this new credit is extremely important.  Some 99% of all active business enterprises in Ireland are small and medium sized according to the CSO figures for 2012.  There are 185,000 people active in SMEs, employing 68% of the workforce and generating half the State's annual turnover.  Last year, 202 extra jobs were created in small businesses in County Clare through the support of the local enterprise office.  The sector is valuable and important in County Clare.<\/p>  <p>  We saw the retention of the 9% VAT rate and the abolition of the air travel tax.  It is important to continue to highlight these measures as they are important year on year to the growth of the tourism industry.  We have supported The Gathering and the Wild Atlantic Way, which resulted in significant growth in our tourism industry after years of stagnation.  It is estimated that last year overseas tourism delivered &euro;4.7 billion to the economy.  One of the greatest success stories for the communities stretching along north Clare and the west Clare coastline has been the Wild Atlantic Way.  Tourists are being driven into areas which had previously been unnoticed.  The opening of the lighthouse at Loop Head was a wonderful addition for tourism in the area.  More than 30,000 people visited Loop Head last year.  This has been a boost for the hotels, restaurants and providers of bed and breakfast accommodation.  New businesses have sprung up in the area.  The new heritage trail from Kilkee to Loop Head won a huge award yesterday in London and congratulations are very much due to everyone concerned.  It is a 69 km heritage trail that takes in 14 local attractions along the route.  Well done to all the local stakeholders because this will pay dividends in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Another area which is making an enormous contribution is the agriculture industry.<\/p><p>Bord Bia estimates that our food and beverage exports for 2014 have reached over &euro;10 billion.  Exports have increased by 45% since 2009.  This is very important because we export 70% to 80% of what we produce.  Farming is extremely important in County Clare, as is the food and drink industry.  Farming supports thousands of jobs, both directly and indirectly, so it is critical that we support farmers.<\/p> <p> The agri-taxation measures included in the Bill are welcome.  The new self-employed tax credit of &euro;550 is welcome for farmers, but I am particularly happy with the introduction of a range of agri-taxation measures which will encourage young farmers back into the industry.  The stock relief for young trained farmers and the stamp duty exemption for young trained farmers has been extended for a further three years.  The family transfer partnership initiative is especially welcome.  This will allow established farmers who wish to pass on their farm to the next generation to form a succession farm partnership.  It will require that 80% of the land is passed on to the next generation within ten years and a tax credit of over &euro;5,000 per annum will be available to split between both partners.  The transfer of land to the next generation is a complex matter, as Members from rural areas are aware, but it is extremely important for sustaining the agricultural sector.  We must encourage young farmers and I believe this initiative will help in that regard.  It provides parents with a guaranteed tax relief within the agreed period of transferring and allows young farmers to share in the farm profits as well.<\/p> <p> Sections 77 to 80, inclusive, relate to the disabled drivers' fuel grant.  My colleague, Deputy Kyne, referred to it earlier.  Provision is being made for the payment of fuel grant to replace the excise repayment scheme, which was ruled incompatible with the EU energy tax initiatives.  The Minister for Finance, following consultation with the Minister for Health, will outline the regulations, including the eligibility criteria.  Broadening the issue is important.  The eligibility criteria in the regulations for the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme should be reviewed.  I have dealt with a number of cases in my office in Ennis involving people who have applied for the primary medical certificate and have been refused it on appeal because of the strict medical criteria laid down in the current regulations.  In one case, for example, the person had suffered a stroke and had lost the use of one leg.  He has sustained repeated falls and needs a specially adapted car and scooter to help him get around, but his application has been refused.  However, if he could not use both legs, he would qualify.  The current regulations are very strict and do not facilitate people with such a disability who need to drive.  Consideration should be given to that.  I ask the Minister to re-examine the eligibility criteria for the scheme.<\/p> <p> I could discuss several other aspects of the Bill, but time does not permit me to do so.  The scheme for accelerated capital allowances to stimulate aviation-related activity came into effect on the night of the budget.  That will encourage the construction of certain aviation-specific facilities, which is a welcome boost for Shannon Airport.  There is significant interest from aviation-related investors in Shannon at present.  A sum of &euro;21 million is being invested in phase one of a major refurbishment of the Shannon Free Zone, which will enhance the region as an attractive location for aviation-related business.  That is very important.  There is a shortage of open office spaces.  If those were in place, it would attract many foreign direct investors to the area.  The Shannon Free Zone was built in the 1960s and was built for light engineering and manufacturing.  However, the type of jobs being created in this country now is very different from the type of jobs that existed in the past.  They are in the life sciences, research and development and aviation-related industries.  We want those jobs and we must have the office space for them.<\/p> <p> I could say a great deal more but my time is concluded.  I commend the Bill and I thank the Minister for his ongoing work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500012#K00200","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446721800,"counter":194,"content":"<p>First, I compliment the Minister on the work he has been doing in the Department since his appointment.  His experience and steady hand have helped in many ways to convey policy and to give people an understanding that the issues that were created and had to be addressed were being dealt with by somebody who had an experience of life and of politics that would lend itself to the proper thought-out policy that was required at a difficult time for this country.<\/p>  <p>  I am also glad the Minister is present this morning to hear some of the contributions from Members.  I will take advantage of my speaking time to raise a number of matters relevant to the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts, given that the Minister is an influential member of the Cabinet and a former chairman of that committee.  It is strange to watch that committee in action and to see fantastic amounts of money being accounted for every Thursday in a way that clearly proves inefficiencies in Departments and agencies, poor value for money being achieved on behalf of the taxpayer and huge losses of money.  The money appears to be unaccounted for.<\/p>  <p>  I recall that when the Minister was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts we discussed the Local Government Audit Service.  I continue to ask that the Local Government Audit Service and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General be amalgamated, to ensure a single organisation within government administration has the power, expertise and necessary skills base to conduct the required forensic examination of accounts across the board and right down to the point where the taxpayers' money is spent.  Similar arrangements are in place in other countries.  I cannot understand why it cannot be done here.<\/p>  <p>  There is a certain cynicism at play when one looks at the workings of government and the Committee of Public Accounts.  When one is in Opposition everything is demanded, such as what I am saying now.  However, I supported that demand when my party was in government.  I stress again that if that amalgamation were to take place, it would create a situation where, perhaps, less money was lost and greater efficiencies and accountability were achieved.  If that happened, the Minister for Finance would not have to go to the current extremes to collect the taxes, because he might not need as many taxes if they were not wasted.<\/p>  <p>  My other issue is what happens when we create an agency such as Irish Water.  A total of &euro;2.6 billion of taxpayers' money will go to Irish Water in funding and loans from the time of its establishment to the end of 2016.  These are not my figures; they come from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General does not audit those accounts.  That is extremely disturbing in a State that requires better administration and a better audit system.  Will the Minister ask the Cabinet to consider bringing Irish Water under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General?  I cannot see anything wrong with that, even if it were to be for the period until it goes off balance sheet.  Incidentally, I believe that to be a nonsense because ultimately the taxpayer is still on the hook for much of this money.<\/p>  <p>  They are my two suggestions.  At one time local government was spending &euro;4 billion of Irish taxpayers' money without a complete audit service being put in place in terms of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It would make great sense and achieve value for money and greater efficiency if the two organisations I mentioned were amalgamated.  There is no reason that it should not or cannot happen, other than the nonsense of a Department fighting over a piece of turf and a position that is dated and requires reform.  The Government was elected on the basis of reform.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to the budget for Departments in terms of the SME sector.  Procurement accounts for approximately &euro;9 billion in this country.  Time and again I have made the case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that in many instances its procurement processes are not working.<\/p><p>To take the stationery procurement process, the buying of equipment is just not working and is actually causing small businesses to go out of business.  We recently had a number of submissions from those affected by that process.  Instead of that &euro;9 billion filtering down to the small businesses throughout the country, it is causing those businesses to close.  When that happens, there should be an immediate turnaround by the Government to ensure corrective measures are taken.<\/p> <p> To take the case of the HSE, it is now subjected to &euro;9 million of compensation claims.  We are told that the small businesses that were not paid on time, which is why the &euro;9 million in compensation applies, would be entitled to claim the &euro;9 million, but the HSE is refusing to compensate those businesses.  It is turning to its legal advisers while the Comptroller and Auditor General is turning to its legal advice in regard to the process and yet the &euro;9 million that is due to the SMEs is not being given to them.<\/p> <p> The budget did not do enough for the SME sector.  I acknowledge what the Minister did in regard to the road haulage industry, given my background is in that industry.  A significant change to the industry's cost base will be incurred because of what the Minister did, and the businesses that are affected are thankful the Government has finally acknowledged it in the context of this budget.  If it is provided properly, that should filter down because everyone uses road haulage and the small parcel service, and, at the end of the day, it should affect the bottom line of those companies and their ability to deliver.<\/p> <p> I also want to refer to the other small businesses, in particular microbusinesses.  When we speak about business in the House, it is generally in regard to Enterprise Ireland or IDA clients, although there is some discussion in regard to the LEOs and how they are now replacing the county enterprise boards.  An awful lot more could have been done for that small business sector in this budget.  The companies in that sector are looking at things that affect their cost base and their profitability but which they have no control over.  For example, the insurance business is spiralling out of control and its cost to small businesses is doubling but nothing is being done about it.  The Government will have to intervene because businesses cannot carry the burden of that cost.<\/p> <p> Commercial rates is another area and it is a cost that has been spoken about in this House from one administration to the other.  It is a burden of tax that businesses find it difficult to pay because, as they adjust the costs that they are able to adjust, the one single cost they cannot touch is commercial rates.  At the same time, it is a cost that does not give them as much as it used to give.  When I originally paid commercial rates on my business, it covered the collection of waste, water and all sorts of other services from the council.  Now, all of these services are separate but the rateable valuation of the properties and the rate applied by the local authorities continues to go up.<\/p> <p> We are now speaking about equalisation, with one administration amalgamated with the other, in trying to form a base where everyone will be equal.  However, it will be extremely difficult for businesses to subscribe to that because they are subscribing to an unfair tax system in any case.  Somebody has to grasp that nettle.  I would have hoped, given the majority the Government has, that it could have insisted on the Valuation Office bringing in legislation to have self-assessment put in place where the properties could be self-assessed.  We can penalise those who have massaged the figures in some way, if that were to be the case, and there would be a penalty.  However, for God's sake, let us give small businesses a chance.<\/p> <p> The tax relief for refurbishing pre-1914 properties is not having any effect on the high streets and villages of this country.  They are not experiencing the upturn and, in fact, they are now so far behind that it will take a considerable amount of money for them to refurbish their properties because they are probably carrying legacy debt as well, and it will cost them a considerable amount to bring themselves back up to simply being in the game.  As a result, high streets and small villages throughout the counties are badly affected.  The pubs, banks and convenience stores are gone and many post offices are under threat, whether as a result of Government policy or simply as a matter of turnover, with people voting with their feet and purchasing their services elsewhere.  The banks are also gone.  The villages are struggling to get footfall and it is impossible for them to do business but nothing in this budget will give them the relief that is necessary to achieve what they want.  For example, someone may want to pass on a family business from one generation to another but it will be closed before the next generation picks it up. <\/p> <p> That is unfortunate because we are a country of small businesses and of budding entrepreneurs who want to make it in the technology sector.  We have seen it with regard to the web summit.  I am deeply disappointed at what has happened in that regard.  It disturbs me to see a Government Minister say, \"Give us the money back\".  We need to maintain the positive profile of this country in regard to the web summit, to information technology and to what the future holds in terms of job prospects for the young entrepreneurs involved in that area.  Something much more positive needs to be done.  We should not just leave it at the departure of not only that web summit but of other associated companies that are based in Ireland and employ people here but that are now leaving.<\/p> <p> Why not ask those involved to meet a sub-committee of the Cabinet to talk about this?  I know from trade abroad that they look to Ireland for innovation and creativity, and for a picture of the future as we see it in technology terms.  If we lose the basis of all of that and if we lose the core of interest that creates a young entrepreneur who will create the next big deal in the world of IT, we will damage that profile.  I think we have been damaged already in regard to the departure of the web summit.  Forget who said what to who and who got the money.  Let us stop that debate, intervene and say we are interested.  Let us see how we can rebuild that relationship and get that web summit back on track.  It is vital to the future of this country and to the future of young people who will work as entrepreneurs from this country.  It will add to the trade this sector is doing abroad in many difficult markets and will influence the input of Irish businesspeople to huge projects in lands where we would never have been involved in trade before.  It is essential that we take steps in this regard.<\/p> <p> I want to touch on the issue of the Revenue Commissioners.  I agree Revenue has a difficult job to do and I agree with many of its approaches.  However, something has to be said about how we approach taxes, penalties and interest.  I have no truck with those who avoid tax and attempt to do so blatantly.  However, I have sympathy for someone who is caught with all of these penalties and interest during the payment of tax, whether the property tax or any of the other mainstream taxes.  Something has to be done to give a softer side to Revenue for those people, to give them some hope of being able to finish paying their bills and paying their way but not in the same draconian way that is applied in the context of penalties and interest.  I firmly believe this should be done.<\/p> <p> This could also be said in regard to the issue of Airbnb.  Let us find some way of dealing with the issue that is sympathetic both to those who were legitimately trying to make some extra money and also to the taxation system.  That is the way it should work.  I appeal to the Minister to look at that issue, when it is being sorted out.<\/p><p>Another issue that has come across my desk is that of ESB pensions.  Surely, with some imagination, a solution could be found for the pensioners involved who are suffering because they are not in receipt of a full pension.  The 2012 Act could be revisited to consider the responsibility of companies to deal with their employees and retirees in a fairer way.<br\/><br\/>I suggest that because we are going down the road of stealth taxes - we now have water and road taxes and so on - we need to take people's incomes into consideration.  The old age pension is to be increased by &euro;3.  However, it may come as a surprise to the Minister that, in the context of the equalisation of rents, local authorities are considering increasing rent payments for pensioners by &euro;3.  The Minister is giving with one hand, but the State is taking back with the other.  If he introduces legislation which includes a measure on fuel, it has an immediate impact on the older population because of their limited income.  They have no way of improving their income, but they are still taxed.  We should be fairer to them.  We need to aim to have a fairer society.  Allowing local authorities to take back what the Minister has just given to pensioners is nonsensical and does not improve their lot.<br\/><br\/>Despite the bad times, local authorities will also continue to increase commercial rates.  This does not make sense.  There is little service from local authorities, but there has been no significant drop in staff numbers, although they are handing over responsibility for housing services and outsourcing refuse collection services.  Nothing much has changed; the <i>status quo<\/i>remains.  This must change.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Minister's position on the 9% VAT rate, which has been a success story.  However, what about looking at small builders who complete extensions and who want to get back into the game?  What about giving them some relief through the VAT rate for a period in order that they can become cost effective and a person refurbishing or extending his or her house can have the job done a little cheaper?  These are the innovative measures the Minister could have applied.  I do not criticise what he has done, but a lot more could have been done.  These measures would be self-financing because he would generate activity in the economy that would give him a greater tax base.  He needs to consider this suggestion.<br\/><br\/>Everybody suggests the Minister should tax the rich and the wealthy, but bad taxes drive out good money.  That is what has been happening.  Perhaps we need to look at attracting the wealthy in order that they could be of benefit and create wealth and employment.  <br\/><br\/>On the corporation tax rate of 12.5% and the companies that have come to Ireland through IDA Ireland, in terms of their corporate social responsibility, how many of them were asked to pay an extra 1% to give the country a break because they have been provided with a break for long enough?  I think they would respond positively.  A company I know of in Kilkenny - I am sure there are similar companies across the country - gives without hesitation to the marginalised and the city and tries to improve the lot of people.  Perhaps as a measure to help the country, such companies might consider paying more in taxes.  I know nobody wants to pay more in tax, but there are companies that would consider a different approach.<br\/><br\/>Last but not least, I want to deal with an issue mentioned by a number of Members, that of the primary medical certificate.  Marginalised individuals on limited incomes have to deal with all of the extra charges being imposed.  The primary medical certificate does not work for them.  It is a joke and its application is not consistent across the country.  I understand the Department of Finance deals with this issue but that it is administered elsewhere.  I ask the Minister to look at it to make the system more flexible and fairer to people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500013#L00200","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446723000,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Deputy John O'Mahony is sharing time with Deputies Eoghan Murphy and John Paul Phelan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500015#N00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1446723000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The country has been on a difficult roller coaster of a journey for the past seven years and every citizen and family has been affected by the economic collapse, the hundreds of thousands of job losses, emigration, mortgage difficulties and negative equity, etc.  In 2010, with the arrival of the troika, we lost control of our destiny.  Following this we had the introduction of USC, wage cuts, the abolition of the Christmas bonus, a ban on the recruitment of garda&iacute;, teachers, nurses and doctors which were consequences of the recklessness of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.  Thanks to the sacrifices of the people and the difficult decisions taken, we are now in a much different space.  Some 130,000 new jobs have been created; we have had a restoration of Army and Garda recruitment and a massive increase in tourist numbers through the stimulus of the 9% VAT rate and the abolition of the travel tax.  Our exports are at record levels.  Agriculture which has been the mainstay of the economy for hundreds of years has come to the rescue once again and the Government has supported it every step of the way and has fought for it at European level in the CAP negotiations.  The net result of the prudent decisions taken by the Government is that for two years now Ireland's economy is the fastest growing in Europe.  More importantly, this growth is more widely based and on a firmer footing than the shifting sands of the construction bubble in the early noughties.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, the budget was about the restoration of the supports and services that had to be suspended because of the economic collapse.  It was about the reversal of difficult decisions that had to be taken because of the state of emergency in which we found ourselves.  It is, however, only part of the journey because it is in the interests of all the people that our recovery not be put at risk.  We must never again gamble on the future of the country and its children.  It would be great if we were able to restore everything immediately, but we cannot.  It was important that the budget put some extra money back into everybody's pockets.  This was particularly important for those on low and middle incomes and the most vulnerable on social welfare payments.  The reduction in USC rates has helped to achieve this, with 42,000 low paid workers being taken out of the USC net altogether, amounting to 700,000 in the past few years.  USC is also being significantly reduced for middle income earners.  Tax cuts are good for the people and the economy.  They lead to the creation of jobs and bring benefits to every family.  Social welfare recipients have been assisted by a range of measures, including the restoration of 75% of the Christmas bonus and increases in family income supplement, carer's support, the old age pension and child benefit, etc.<\/p>  <p>  As somebody who was involved in education for many years, I am very aware of the effects the recession has had on this sector of the economy.  I welcome the additional recruitment of new teachers and the proposed changes in class sizes.  I also welcome the announcement today of the multi-annual funding for the summer works and minor works schemes for primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communication, I am especially delighted to see the significant reduction in motor tax for hauliers across the country.  In the past four years the committee has heard presentations from those involved in this sector about the serious disadvantages hauliers in Ireland faced compared to their counterparts abroad.  I commend the Minister for taking action on this matter as otherwise we would have lost many jobs and livelihoods.  Transportation costs are a major issue for every business in Ireland, both large and small.  In budget 2016 there are major reductions in commercial motor tax rates.  The number of rates will be reduced from 20 to five and they will range from &euro;90 to &euro;900 per year, down from a maximum rate of &euro;5,195.  These changes will benefit over 28,500 commercial vehicles and come into effect in January 2016.<\/p><p>This budget also addressed self-employment, beginning the equalisation of tax treatment between the self-employed and PRSI workers.  There is still a way to go on this and it should be continually addressed.  Self-employed people are risk-takers.  We are at a stage of growth in the economy where they could take on extra workers.  It is important they have some safety valves and guarantees if they become sick or their business goes into difficulty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500015#N00300","speaker":"1073","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446723600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I welcome the Finance Bill and the measures in it and congratulate the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on his work.  I wish to touch on some issues I raised in pre-budget submissions to the Minister, so he will be familiar with them.  On income taxation in general, it is good to see that taxes on work are beginning to come down in a number of areas.  These reductions are necessary at this point in the economic cycle, if we are to continue to increase productivity and jobs.  The result will be more taxes coming through to Revenue and more money to spend in the public good.  It is important that we are doing that.<\/p><p>I would caution against maintaining the discrimination imposed on high earners through the USC.  It is counter-productive to economic growth and it is also unfair given that these earners pay a far greater proportion of their income in tax compared to other workers in Ireland and to high earners in other jurisdictions.  I hope we can quickly come to a point where nobody's marginal rate of taxation is above 50% because it is far too high.  I am very glad we have made a commitment to do this if we are re-elected.<\/p><p>It is equally important that we finally move to tax equality for the self-employed versus PAYE workers.  We made the first step in that direction in this budget and, if we are re-elected, I hope we can achieve it in one more budget rather than spreading it out over two or three.  It comes back to what earlier speakers have said about bad taxes driving out good money.  Wealth creation is a good thing.  We should create as much wealth as we can in order to distribute it in a fair way towards the public good.  That should be our motivation as we look forward, hopefully, to another term in government and a fiscal course for the coming years.<\/p><p>A number of measures were considered when it came to lower income earners.  I would have liked to have seen a reduction in the VAT rate, either alongside or instead of measures introduced in the Finance Bill.  It might have been introduced instead of taking people out of the USC tax net altogether, for example.  In the matter of disposable income on lower salaries, a change in VAT could have a proportionally greater impact on people's lives.  I hope we can consider that in the future.  <\/p><p>When it comes to capital acquisitions tax - some people call it the death tax and others know it as the inheritance tax - the change in the threshold was very welcome but it needs to be increased even more.  Looking at other OECD countries, Norway and Sweden do not have any inheritance tax at all and the threshold entry point in the UK is much higher than ours.  I would like to see that threshold increase, or to see us moving, like Germany, to a more progressive system of inheritance taxation.  Theirs is a different system altogether and some would argue it is fairer.  The way in which we collect this tax and the time we give to do so also needs to be examined.  The tax is levied within the first six months and people do not necessarily have the means to pay it without disposing of the asset and yet it might not be possible to dispose of the asset to pay the tax.<\/p><p>I will speak further about incentivising investment in small companies when we come to the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill later this afternoon.  Peer-to-peer financing is now an established mechanism here.  I have raised it a number of times in the D&aacute;il over the past few years.  It is an alternative funding model for small businesses and an alternative saving and investment market for small lenders.  We need to consider what the UK is doing to encourage this new financing market.  There, they encourage lenders by including interest earned in tax break schemes, and encourage borrowers by topping up successful loans with Government money.  The UK has seen this type of financing grow exponentially in the past three years.  It is much better for the small saver who wants to earn a higher rate of return and put their money to more productive use.  It is much better for the borrower who wants to avoid incurring some of the costs associated with bank lending, which might not always be open to them.  I hope we can follow suit in this regard.  There are other measures I would like to see us copy from the UK but I will come to them at another time.  The peer-to-peer financing measures that have been adopted are proven; they do work and there is no reason we cannot implement them.<\/p><p>Land use in Dublin is a very important issue.  We need to incentivise more efficient land use.  One issue that was put to me recently is under-occupation of homes, in particular family homes.  There may no longer be a need for a family home of a large size, or it may be too expensive for the couple to maintain the house.  At the same time, we have lots of young families looking for affordable homes who cannot find them.  If we could incentivise the market for trading down, for a couple in a large house moving into a smaller home or apartment, it would be a good thing.  Perhaps we could do it by exempting people from stamp duty when trading down.  Criteria would have to be put in place to make sure the exemption was not abused.  It might help bring about more efficient use of land in Dublin.<\/p><p>We also have a significant amount of vacant space above commercial premises in Dublin.  It can be seen on any main street in the city and in our urban villages.  We can incentivise above-the-shop living, which is closer to the norm in other European cities.  The quickest way to achieve that is through tax reliefs.  It needs to be considered now, particularly in the context of the current crisis.  Collaboration with Dublin City Council would be needed because the regulation and red tape when it comes to changing the use of above-shop spaces - factors like access, minimum size and standards - must be examined.  There is now a form of hyper-regulation of these standards which is not the case in other European cities.  We have all been to other European cities, either through work or personal travel, and they do not have the kind of restrictions on accommodation conversion that we have in Dublin.<\/p><p>It would have been beneficial if I could have brought these issues to an independent budget oversight office separate from the Department of Finance and had them costed, debated and maybe even recommended by an independent budget committee.  It is welcome that the Minister is committed to an independent budget oversight office.  The sooner we get it off the ground the better.  It must be accompanied by some sort of standing, year-round budgetary scrutiny committee separate from the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, which has a much wider remit and focus.  We could then debate individual measures once we had them costed and perhaps bring them forward as recommendations.  I would also like to see the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council reporting directly to such a committee to give it greater independence from the Government and also to give the D&aacute;il greater power.<\/p><p>The Minister is aware of my tax transparency website, <i>taxtransparency.ie<\/i>because I have shown it to him.  It is now up and running for the 2016 budget figures.  Anyone can have their income tax calculated and get a breakdown in simple euros and cents of how that money is spent by Government Departments.  The UK and the US do it.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Revenue Commissioners and the Comptroller and Auditor General support it.  The Department of Finance should now support and introduce it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500016#O00200","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1446723600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister, Deputy Noonan as others, including some Opposition Members, have done for his stewardship of the economy over the past four and half years and in extraordinary times.  It is not by accident that Ireland's economic growth figures are the envy of most other countries.  It is through the efforts of individuals, businesses and members of the Government, not least the Minister for Finance, that we now find ourselves in a position to introduce a favourable budget.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the sentiments of Deputy Breen and others on the primary medical certificate.  I had not intended to speak about it but the current criteria are too rigid and not particularly fit for purpose in this day and age.  It is admittedly a complicated area but does merit some intense consideration.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister's decision to introduce the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector in his first budget has arguably been the best decision he and the Government have made in the course of their time in office.<\/p><p>It has stimulated significant economic growth across the country because the hospitality sector is in every town and nearly every village.  It has had a dramatic effect on economic activity and the numbers of people employed in that sector.<\/p> <p> I wish to raise another issue about which I have not had a chance to have any real discussions because I received an e-mail on the matter late in the day.  Perhaps the Minister's officials might be able to examine it at some point.  It concerns VAT on certain medicines.  Deputy Twomey will probably have a more detailed knowledge of this than I have but I received a communication from individuals who suffer from skin conditions like psoriasis and eczema and related illnesses.  They probably contacted me because I am a psoriasis sufferer so I should confess a vested interest in that regard.  They maintain that the existing rates of VAT on certain medications that are necessary in this area should be looked at with a view to removing some of them in the future.  I hope this can be examined.  My only regret is that I received the communication too late to be able to examine it in any great detail.  <\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that the budget and the Finance Bill include substantial provisions for the reduction in the USC.  Perhaps many economists would argue that the USC is a very equitable tax but, rightly or wrongly, the public is understandably of the view that this was a temporary measure that was introduced at a time of economic crisis.  The fact that we have seen the first substantial step in reducing it in this budget and this Finance Bill as part of a plan to phase it out completely over the next number of years if economic growth continues is to be greatly welcomed.  I cannot commend the Minister enough in that regard.  <\/p> <p> I join Deputy Eoghan Murphy and others in praising the Minister's measures concerning the earned income credit for the self-employed with a view to levelling the pitch for self-employed people.  This is a welcome inclusion in the Finance Bill and the budget.  Like tourism and hospitality, agriculture is probably the other sector that kept the country moving in the right direction through the worst of the recession.  I welcome the extension of various reliefs the Minister announced to the end of 2018.  In particular, I welcome the new measure concerning succession and transfer of partnerships.  It has received positive feedback from the agricultural community and is to be welcomed.  <\/p> <p> I wish to raise some other issues in advance of the next round of budgetary measures that must be discussed.  I welcome the fact that this week, there are reports of a surge in corporation tax receipts and the changes relating to the knowledge development box, which were announced in the budget and included in the Finance Bill.  I would ask that emphasis in the future be placed on looking at the reduction of capital taxes, particularly DIRT.  There were understandable economic reasons for increasing DIRT at a time when we sought to promote economic activity.  From an economic development perspective, perhaps the Government wanted people to spend money.  We are now entering a different zone and perhaps more encouragement needs to given to citizens to save for their futures.  This is why I believe the current level of DIRT is prohibitively high.  I have received a lot of communications from constituents who have fairly modest savings and who are not receiving the return they might have expected.  They are rightly looking to the Government for a reduction in that tax in the future.  I welcome the provisions of the Finance Bill and I am glad to have had the opportunity to raise a few points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500016#O00300","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446724200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>At this point, it is important to inject some reality into the debate.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the growth that exists in the State.  We have had a growth desert for the past number of years so any growth is welcome.  However, it is very important that we analyse the contributing factors to this growth.  If we do not analyse them, we are clearly liable to make mistakes with regard to policy.<\/p><p>The major elements within growth at the moment are external to the State and are not under its control.  The key ingredients include the weak euro, low interest rates, quantitative easing, low oil prices and the growth of the UK and US markets to which we are very much tied, more so than the other European economies.  A lot of pent-up investment and pro-cyclical investment is starting to seep through.  The FDI exports sector is quite strong at the moment.  There is no doubt that these are feeding at last into the domestic economy but there is a caveat.  The domestic economy they are feeding into is mainly on the east coast and there is division between it and the west coast, the Border region and the midlands with regard to the level of growth.  There is also a division with regard to the demographic elements which are receiving the benefits of that growth.  <\/p><p>We heard a while ago that there is buoyancy with corporate tax receipts.  Indeed we do and this buoyancy is startling.  It is &euro;2 billion ahead of expectations at this moment in time.  When the chief economist at the Department of Finance appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 8 October, I asked him what was behind this.  He said that he could not say for sure but there is a growing body of opinion, mine included, that believes that much FDI is starting to regularise its corporation tax contributions due to the changes the Government is making with regard to corporation tax - changes the Government was dragged kicking and screaming into making.  If the Minister had listened to Sinn F&eacute;in in 2011 and implemented those changes, imagine the billions of euro that would have been at his disposal to use within the economy.  It is shocking that this is happening because the Government is being forced into it.  I cannot think of another area of Government policy where the Government is forced to make changes to increase the level of tax buoyancy within the economy.  <\/p><p>The truth is that there are strong tail-winds within the Irish economy.  If these cease, the inherent weaknesses in the domestic economy will be exposed.  This is why it is necessary for us to strengthen the indigenous economy and create real competitiveness to ensure real growth and strength.  There is continuous Government divestment from the infrastructure of this State on an annual basis.  Even in the Spring Economic Statement, the Government stated that it was planning to cut Government investment from 1.8% of GDP to 1.5% by 2020.  Most conservative economists will say that just to maintain the capital stock of the State, this level of Government investment needs to be at 4% so the Government is divesting from the infrastructure of the State at a phenomenal rate.  The outworking of that can be seen with regard to the Global Competitiveness Report, which says that Ireland has disimproved with regard to competitiveness over the past 12 months.  In respect of areas like office rents, health infrastructure and water infrastructure, we are making it increasingly difficult for businesses functioning in Ireland to succeed and less likely that we can attract businesses to this country in the future.<\/p><p>It is also important to look at this budget in the context of the vandalism done to the Irish economy over the past years.  We have a housing crisis where people are dying on the streets.  We have a health crisis.  The <i>Irish Daily Mail<\/i>reported that a young father of two bled to death in Dundalk due to the fact that an ambulance did not make it on time.

The Taoiseach said he wanted to know who was responsible and described it as a shocking example of the dysfunctionality of the system.  He has joined the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in being a commentator from the sidelines on the health service.  There are several other stories today.  An 87 year old woman was allegedly sexually assaulted when she was placed in an all-male ward because of overcrowding, which is absolutely cruel and callous.  We all agree that older people, particularly at such a vulnerable time in their lives, deserve better and at least to be treated with decency and dignity.<\/p><p>In the past hour, in this morning&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Daily Mirror<\/i>and on &quot;Today with Sean O&rsquo;Rourke&quot; another story was told which had the absolute worst outcome.  It concerns the death of Dualtagh Donnelly because of ambulance delays in Dundalk.  It took 39 minutes for an ambulance to arrive after he had severed an artery in his arm.  He lived five minutes from the base station.  He was a young man, the father of two young children, with another child on the way.  Will the Minister ask for the case to be independently investigated in order that such a case can be avoided in the future?  Mr. Donnelly's partner spoke very movingly and courageously on &quot;Today with Sean O&rsquo;Rourke&quot; this morning and the family is to be commended for going public about its tragic loss.  There are problems in the National Ambulance Service and delays all over the country.  This will happen again, unless there is an independent investigation and lessons are learned.  <\/p><p>The approach of Mr. Donnelly&rsquo;s family is very different from that of the management of Tallaght hospital which states it will investigate Dr. Gray&rsquo;s letter.  It will not investigate why a 91 year old man was left on a trolley but the doctor and how his correspondence was released to the public.  It seems it is not interested in the treatment of patients but in disciplining and silencing its critics and those who raise genuine cases of concern.  Surely the management of a hospital should be worried about how it took 29 hours for a 91 year old to be given a bed in a ward rather than scapegoating a doctor.<\/p><p>The Minister has introduced whistleblower legislation and championed whistleblowers for many years.  Does he believe Tallaght hospital&rsquo;s approach is correct?  Does he believe that, where they have issues of serious concern, doctors and medical staff should be allowed to bring them to management?  Will he confirm that the incident at South Tipperary General Hospital took place, as reported this morning?  Will he commit, on behalf of the Government, to initiating an independent investigation into the reason for the delay in the arrival of an ambulance for the late Mr. Donnelly in Dundalk? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500018#Q00600","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1446724800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising three discrete and separate issues.  I will not have time to go into them in any great detail.  Each has to be considered individually.  <\/p><p>For some time the Government has been examining emergency departments in hospitals as a priority.  That is why last December the Minister for Health and I discussed how to resource them and ensure there would be adequate resources to deal with the pressures on them.  Last December the Minister for Health established an emergency task force.  We tried to identify the impediments to ensuring people had access to beds quickly when it was determined in emergency departments that they needed them.  We have deployed considerable resources to get what used to be called late discharges out of hospital into a more appropriate setting.  That is why we have further resourced the fair deal scheme greatly such that the 16 week waiting time has been reduced to between two and four weeks.  There are 1,200 additional home care packages in order that people can be treated at home rather than in an emergency or hospital setting.  We have also opened additional beds.<\/p><p>Let us consider the individual cases about which the Deputy talked.  With great respect to him, in the case of the 91 year old man, we need to respect the privacy of the individual.  However, an aged person should not have been left on a trolley for that length of time.  We need to understand why and how it happened.  That is separate from the individual&rsquo;s right to privacy which neither the hospital authorities nor the Government can ignore.  However, we need to know exactly what happened in the case and why the person concerned did not have access to a bed.<\/p><p>In the very sad case of Dualtagh Donnelly in Dundalk I join the Deputy in expressing my sympathy and that of the Government to the Donnelly family.  I understand the National Ambulance Service received the emergency call at 3.06 a.m. on Monday, 26 October.  It was classified as life-threatening.  The rapid response vehicle crewed by an advanced paramedic arrived at the scene 23 minutes later at 3.29 a.m.  An emergency ambulance arrived at 3.45 a.m.  While the emergency paramedics were <i>en route<\/i>, the National Ambulance Service call taker stayed on the line to give first aid instructions to the caller.  On their arrival, the paramedics did everything they could for the patient, but, unfortunately and regrettably, he passed away, which is very sad. <\/p><p>On the third issue, the alleged assault in South Tipperary General Hospital, on 28 October a female patient was checked by medical staff.  The Garda was called and it is investigating the matter.  The male patient was moved to a side room and has been approved for long-term care and remains in hospital, where he is monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by security staff, pending acceptance by a health care facility appropriate to his needs.  The matter is being properly investigated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>As a former Minister for Health, I am aware that emergency departments provide front-line services for a variety of cases.  Issues will arise, in respect of we need full transparency.  The Deputy is right that if anybody wishes to make a complaint about any matter, staff or not, it must be fully and completely independently investigated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500018#Q00700","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1446724800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>There are two accounts of the ambulance issue.  It would be worthwhile and give comfort to the family if somebody independent were to investigate it, to talk to the family privately and talk through exactly what happened because there are lessons to be learned.  This is happening everywhere.  There are ambulance delays all over the country; we just do not hear about them, but we all experience them.<\/p>  <p>  This morning the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, used the word \"chaos\" about emergency services.  It is the beginning of November and the delays and pressures arising in emergency departments normally do not surface until December or January.  Mr. Liam Woods, national director for acute hospitals at the Health Service Executive, mentioned preparing and putting a winter plan in place.<\/p><p>Winter is here and its results can be seen in our accident and emergency units every night of the week now, not just at weekends.  It seems to be continually pushed down the line, with people saying, \"It is not our problem\".  The emergency task force has been branded a failure by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, even though nurses were at the heart of it.  They are now balloting for a strike.  The people on whom we depend for our emergency service have no confidence in the task force and are planning a strike and one of the Ministers in charge uses the term \"chaotic\" in respect of it.  When is the Government going to take specific action to avoid these delays?  They should not be happening at any time of the year but especially early in the winter when there is no pressure on the system in terms of colds, flu and other winter illnesses.

An elderly woman, placed in an all-male ward due to overcrowding in South Tipperary General Hospital, was allegedly subjected to a horrific sexual assault.  In another report we read of Dualtagh Donnelly, the father of two who, having cut his arm on a glass door, bled to death while waiting for 40 minutes for an ambulance to arrive.  This is despite the fact that the family home where he lived was only five minutes from Dundalk ambulance station and close to Louth County Hospital, whose accident and emergency department has been closed.  All these stories come on the back of the story we heard yesterday of the 91 year old man who was lying on a trolley for 29 hours in Tallaght Hospital.  The Minister said the Government would address these problems but it is five years into its term of office, its last dying months.  When is it going to fix the trolley crisis?  When will it fix the crisis in our ambulance services?  Dualtagh Donnelly may have been able to be on this earth today if an ambulance was there for him at the appropriate time.<\/p>  <p>  These are not isolated instances.  This House has heard different stories about delays to ambulances where they have been deployed without paramedics or where people have had to ask neighbours to drive the ambulance.  We have heard of ambulances whose wheels have fallen off.  The trolley crisis only gets national attention and prominence when it is a 91 year old person or someone aged 100 or more but should it be acceptable, in this day and age in our society, to allow a 50 year old or a 15 year old to spend 29 hours on a hospital trolley?  The 91 year old to whom I refer was joined yesterday by over 400 individuals.  Is it not time to accept that after five years in office, the Government has failed to deliver on fixing the health crisis?  Is it not reasonable to accept that its failure to invest after stripping valuable resources out of our health service is the cause of what we read in our national newspapers today and have read on many other days in the past year?  <\/p>  <p>  According to the budget document, the Government has provided &euro;18 million in additional funding for 2016 when demographic pressures and the Lansdowne Road agreement are stripped out, yet it provides multiples of that amount - nearly ten times the amount - in tax reliefs to those who earn over &euro;70,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500019#R01700","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1446725400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Is this a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500019#R01800","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1446725400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>The Minister may not want to hear it but I said on budget night that when he deploys policies like that, this is what we will get.

The individual circumstances are obviously particular to these families, as are the tragedies that unfolded.  We all know of different cases.  Yesterday, there were more than 400 people on hospital trolleys and this is likely to continue.  The Taoiseach's answer to this question yesterday was that things were likely to get worse and that we would hear of more terrible stories.  Government Deputies have spoken about the inevitability that this will escalate in coming months.  It is inevitable because of the policies the Government is pursuing but it is not inevitable that every day, we need to have 400 patients - 400 of our citizens - on trolleys on emergency department corridors or in hospital wards.  It is not inevitable that we regularly have to have fewer ambulances available than should available.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated that 20% fewer ambulances were available in that region than should have been available and that we had a death, more than likely, as a result of the failure of that ambulance to get there within the appropriate period of time.  It took 40 minutes for that ambulance to arrive and yet the person was within five minutes of the ambulance station.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister pointed out, this is not unique to Dundalk.  It happens in other areas, as we have known for the past five years.  What will the Government do to ensure no other person loses his or her life as Dualtagh Donnelly did because of the lack of basic life-saving services in any region?  Dualtagh Donnelly's mother Oonagh said, \"I have that much anger in me, I feel my son died because of politicians' policies.\"  It is hard to disagree with that.  It is the Government's failure to deal with such issues, which are not isolated but are now systemic across Irish society, that is not just leading to the inconvenience of people having to spend a couple of hours on hospital trolleys or having to wait a couple of extra minutes for an ambulance service but is having implications for health outcomes, in some cases leading to people losing their lives.  Does the Minister accept that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500020#S00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1446726000,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Let me be crystal clear.

If we take into account the thousands who were forced to emigrate, the figures for youth unemployment would be well over 30%.<\/p>  <p>  CSO figures published last month show an overall unemployment rate in September of 9.4% and we all welcome the progress made to date.

In addition, the live register figures indicate that 65,600 people of all ages were on activation and training schemes and these are not counted in the jobless total.<\/p>  <p>  The PricewaterhouseCoopers survey released this week pointed out that Ireland is losing billions because we are failing to tap into the potential of our youth.  It points to high levels of unemployment and low levels of participation in job training, vocational education and apprenticeships.

Since 2008, approximately &euro;3.3 billion worth of funding has been gouged out of the health service, a large chunk of it by this Government.<\/p><p>We have heard a number of serious, tragic, difficult cases today during Leaders' Questions.<br\/><br\/>I want to speak about one specific case and I would like if the Minister could listen to it.  It shows how citizens are being impacted by the crisis in the health service.  I know a 66 year old woman who has just retired from her work.  She worked hard and raised her family.  She lives about five minutes away from the hospital and had a stroke.  It took 45 minutes for the ambulance to come to her house and take her to the hospital.  As with a stroke, time is of the essence.  She recovered very slowly and eventually reached a level of recovery where she needed access to the national rehabilitation centre.  After being clinically discharged she had to wait 13 weeks in the hospital to gain access to the centre where she had rehabilitation and was able to go home although with much reduced mobility.  A year later she had a stroke and went back into her local hospital.  Two nurses took her to the shower one day to give her a shower.  Given the pressure on the nurses, one was pulled away and the woman, who is now 67 years of age, fell, cracked her head on the shower and suffered a brain injury.  She was transferred to a major Dublin hospital where she had brain surgery.  The next day she had a blood transfusion.  For an hour and half she was given the wrong blood which caused renal failure and other damage to her internal organs.  She remained unconscious for eight weeks as a result of the brain injury and the incorrect blood transfusion.<br\/><br\/>This is a woman who, in at least five separate engagements in a period of three years, has been damaged by the HSE and the health service.  After eight weeks she started to open her eyes and to communicate.  She had a tracheotomy and started to breathe.  She is now in serious difficulty.  Her future is a nursing home.  This is the damage, the vandalism that has been done to the Irish public services by the gouging of the money from these services and the reorientation of that money through budgets towards paying back the bondholders and so on.  There are many other things wrong with the State as a result.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned earlier that we have reduced education investment, there are high levels of personal debt, low wages, precarious employment, rising rental costs, regressive taxation in regard to water charges and property charges, crippling child care costs and exorbitant mortgage repayments.  A third of a million of the population has left the State in the past six years.  One in six Irish people live abroad, one in four of the cohort between 20 and 30 years of age.  The <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i>conducted a poll recently which found that 62% of the population felt that none of the benefits of the recovery had entered their lives in any way.  At the same time the wealthy are getting wealthier.  We heard Deputy Eoghan Murphy speak a few minutes ago.  He felt that those in upper income range were being discriminated against by the taxation system and called for reform of the universal social charge, USC, so that they would get more money into their pockets.<br\/><br\/>In the budget, some &euro;180 million was returned to those earning &euro;75,000 and upwards through USC cuts, while there was a &euro;24 million net extra investment in the health service.  The difference in priority is clear.  Some &euro;69 million was invested in housing, a third of the actual amount of money that went back to that cohort earning more than &euro;75,000, so the wealthy are getting wealthier.  The wealthiest 250 individuals in the State saw their wealth grow by 16% to more than &euro;75 billion in the past 12 months.<br\/><br\/>The week before the budget, Sinn F&eacute;in relaunched its alternative budget.  Our budget simply sought to reduce the deficit in the same manner as the Government did within the fiscal rules.  Our budget was fiscally responsible but it was also socially responsible, which is a key element.  It allowed for a competitive economy but also a fairer society.  Our budget would have invested twice as much as the Government in public services and the economy through the development of a fair taxation system which brought in a little more revenue to achieve these aims.  It would also have put about &euro;2,000 back in the pockets of ordinary citizens.  <br\/><br\/>As the spokesperson on enterprise I am disappointed that so little was done for medium to small businesses in the budget.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe that those who work hard, use their abilities and who take risks deserve to be economically compensated for those activities.  Many very small micro enterprises around the country are being forgotten with regard to this type of compensation.  We see the whole of the enterprise strategy skewed towards large FDIs.  We welcome FDIs and there is no doubt they are important to this country but we need to strike a balance within the economy.  If we do not do so we will not have sustainability.  Our alternative budget sought to alleviate some of the tax challenges experienced by very small businesses as regards the tax credit earned through income, similar to the plans the Government introduced.  We also sought that small businesses would not be penalised by the increase in the minimum wage.  We would increase employer PRSI to 8.5% at the threshold of &euro;377 per week.  We also sought to differentiate between positive and active investments when it comes to capital gains tax to ensure that entrepreneurs who do invest in an active fashion in their business get to reap the rewards and that they are differentiated from speculators who simply invest in stocks and shares and seek rewards in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>We also sought to extend the start-up relief for entrepreneurs to self-employed people who had not previously paid PAYE.  That programme is aimed only at those who paid PAYE.  There is a dichotomy of treatment between the two sectors even though we expect them to start up new business.  We have also sought a reorientation in regard to people's spending patterns.  One of the major trends in recent years is that people are spending billions of euro more online.  That means that billions of euro are leaking out of the country as &euro;3 out of every &euro;4 spent online ends up in another state.  What we need to do is increase the capability of local businesses to do e-commerce.  We have sought a doubling of the current trading online voucher scheme to keep more businesses at home. <br\/><br\/>We also sought to speed up the administration of the tax system for businesses to resolve the excessive turnaround with regard to registration.  Those delays are impacting on businesses and preventing economic activity from taking place.  We also included in our budget that small businesses should be allowed to pay tax on accounts.  Rather than having to pay all the tax in one instalment they would be able to pay it over and over, which would alleviate the pressures that exist with regard to cash flow within business.<br\/><br\/>We sought a 50% relief for indigenous craft beer producers to 35,000 hectolitres because it is an important growing sector of society.  We sought to improve the opportunities for small and medium businesses to access public procurement.  Currently, there is &euro;20 billion annual public spend on goods, services and capital projects and most small businesses are locked out of that.  One of the key changes that has happened in recent years that people do not realise is that governments have centralised that process further, thus making it more difficult for people in local authorities to be able to tender for work, which means that the income gets centralised also.<br\/><br\/>We proposed that tenders should be reduced to make sure they were more accessible to people.  This is a very important point.  This and the previous Government has divested massively from infrastructural spend in recent years.  The Spring Economic Statement indicated that Government spend in this are would reduce from 1.8% to 1.5% of GDP by 2020.  Most conservative economists will say that to maintain capital stock we need an investment of 4% of GDP in Government spend.  The Government is divesting significantly, which is having an effect on competitiveness.  We indicated in our alternative budget that there should be a &euro;400 million extra spend in infrastructure, much of it in housing and some in transport infrastructure.<\/p><p>Added up over five years, that comes to &euro;2 billion extra in our budget plan.  We also want to increase the knowledge economy by putting extra funds into education, while scrapping the property and water taxes to create stimulus right through the economy.<\/p> <p> The Finance Bill refers to the banking sector.  It is important we examine what is a happening in the banking sector.  Yesterday, we heard the disastrous news from Bank of Ireland that it is seeking new regulations which would prevent people from withdrawing less than &euro;700 or lodging less than &euro;3,000 at a bank counter.  The reasons for this change of attitude in the bank include information technology developments and pressures due to the crash.  However, another major reason is the Government has produced an oligopolistic banking market through its policy of two pillar banks with the rest being small players around these.  This leads to oligopolistic behaviour from the banks.  That means it is a sellers&rsquo; market, not a buyers&rsquo; market.  In banking terms that means the banks dictate terms for everything to their customers.  We see that with high mortgage rates, higher than they are abroad, as well as high interest rates for business, again higher than abroad, with closures of banks in provincial towns and with the prohibitions on withdrawals and lodgements.<\/p> <p> For a viable banking system, one needs many small non-systemic players.  This year, on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I launched a policy document for the introduction of a public banking system.  When some Members on the Government benches think of public banking, they think of reds under the bed stuff.  Yet, a large chunk, some 40%, of Germany&rsquo;s banking system is public banking.  This is a normal element of most healthy banking systems.  Such a development would bring banks back into the locality.  In our particular plan, we had a plan for ten regional banks to take away from the concentrated oligopolistic nature of the banking system.<\/p> <p> I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on the radio this morning discussing the health crisis.  While she did not mention names, it was clear to anybody listening that she had several arguments with colleagues in government.  The Minister of State and her party has only 12 weeks left to make a massive mark.  It may be the last mark.  If I was in her position, and this was the last opportunity I had to make a significant change on a whole range of policy outcomes from this Government, I would be not making just an argument or a case but a stand for these issues.<\/p> <p> T&aacute; s&eacute; uaf&aacute;sach nach bhfuil seans ag gach duine sa Teach labhairt ar an mBille seo le linn an lae, go mbeidh an guillotine ag teacht anuas ar an mBille seo chun bac a chur orainne &aacute;r gcuid smaoint&iacute; a chur os comhair an Rialtais.

Throughout those years, Ireland weathered its way through the worst economic crisis since the foundation of the State.  Budget 2016 is a landmark budget because it marked the occasion when this country had money to spend for the first time since 2007.  My contribution to this debate will focus on how budget 2016 delivered for our rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  In the days after the Budget Statement, several people asked me what budget 2016 delivers for rural communities across the midlands.  I summed it up with three points.  It delivers relief for farmers, introduces new supports for local businesses and provides more garda&iacute;.  Coming from a constituency with a large farming community, and as a farmer myself, the measures introduced in budget 2016 will have an overwhelmingly positive impact, especially for younger farmers.  One of the most positive aspects is the tax credit of &euro;5,000 per annum for five years for farmers who transfer their land to successors over time, making it easier for farms to be passed from one generation to the next.  Equally, the series of agri-taxation measures, like stock relief and stamp duty exemptions, will all make farming more attractive to younger people and families.  This should be warmly welcomed by all sides of the House.<\/p>  <p>  Supporting local business, the budget will encourage job creation and help employers.  Throughout the economic crisis, local retailers were the key drivers in the economic recovery, as they were able to generate local employment and keep their local communities alive.  Accordingly, it is only fair that this budget rewards those small retailers by reducing costs, which up until now have been hitting them hard.  These reductions will come into effect on 9 December and will save retailers an estimated &euro;36 million in fees per year.  This budget is a positive one after what has been a stressful time for small business owners and the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  Rural crime has always been a serious issue, but it has become more widespread as highly mobile criminal gangs use our road networks to target isolated areas and escape with ease.  The substantial investment in more garda&iacute; in recent weeks, along with the budget announcement of 600 additional recruits, will boost the 550 who have already started work since the Government reopened Templemore Garda College.  While I have raised this issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality already, I would like to put on the record again that I believe a majority of these 600 additional recruits should be stationed in rural communities, along with the introduction of additional community CCTV, closed-circuit television, schemes.<\/p>  <p>  This is a constructive budget.  Up to 410,000 fewer people will now pay the Fianna F&aacute;il universal social charge, USC.  The past few budgets have been hard, but they made it possible for Ireland to exit the bailout, reduce our debts and move into real recovery.  This budget is affordable, responsible and consistent with the Government&rsquo;s plan to eliminate Government borrowing by 2018.<\/p>  <p>  It will drive job creation and support local businesses in rural areas.  The Government has prioritised job creation since it took office.  The more jobs created, the less tax for those already working and more revenue for providing better services for our people.  We are also committed to ensuring work is rewarded and communities across Ireland benefit from this recovery.  There is a feel-good factor in the country compared to five years ago.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the recent announcement concerning the provision of an additional stroke machine in the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar.  I also welcome the progress in the new accident and emergency unit in the hospital, with &euro;6 million in funding provided by the Government for its completion.<\/p><p>The provision of 46 primary care centres by the Government is an important aspect for communities.  This should be welcomed and is acknowledged by the general public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500025#X00300","speaker":"1062","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446729000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the Finance Bill.  Looking back over recent years, one of the primary objectives of the jobs initiative was to introduce the 9% VAT rate, which has been a huge success.  This success has been built on by the Action Plan for Jobs.  Since the outset I was of the opinion that once we got the chance to reduce the universal social charge, we should do so, in particular for the lower paid first and then to work up along the income levels.  It was an emergency tax that crippled many people.  There have been discussions about those on higher salaries and the tax contributions they make.  Many people had an awful lot of commitments before the financial meltdown because they felt the economy would continue to be strong.  They have been through horrific times.  It is good to see that the universal social charge will be phased out.  It has been promised that it will be phased out and this gives a clear indication that the emergency is passing.<\/p><p>I have worked quite a lot in our campaign to support small businesses.  I have been in business for 20 years and was delighted to see an earned income tax credit for the self-employed, which will help to level the playing pitch.  I hope this new tax credit will yet equalise the tax treatment of PAYE workers and the self-employed and is to be welcomed.  It should have been done a long time ago, but now we at least have made a start in that direction.  I am also glad to see that the home carer's tax credit is increasing from &euro;810 to &euro;1,000.  <\/p><p>I have said this before, but it is important that we look again at the tax relief on qualifying farming leases.  One condition of the relief is that leases will only qualify for the relief when the parties to the lease are not related.  This is a mistake because most farms are transferred between fathers or mothers and sons or daughters.  Most transfers are within families.  We need to encourage the transfer of land because the age structure in the farming industry is still far too high, but we are not unique in this regard.  It applies across the world, but we now have an opportunity to address it.  The conditions could be applied stringently and the scheme could ensure transfers were made done at arm's length and on a commercial basis.  A trial period for two years could be considered to see how it would work.  If it did not work, we could address the issue again.  In effect, it would be a <i>de facto<\/i>retirement scheme.<\/p><p>With tax credits for farm transfers, we would be proactive in ensuring farming became a younger person's game.  These are turbulent times in farming, but there is a feel good factor.  Milk quotas are gone and we are in expansion mode, but we are also cognisant of the troubles.  The capital gains tax exemption of &euro;3 million needs to be examined closely and increased.  Huge investment is taking place and the threshold will be reached very quickly.  We do not want any impediment to the transfer of farms which creates huge levels of employment.  <\/p><p>It did not happen this time and perhaps it might be looked at again, but I would like to see tax relief for people who want to invest in the sugar industry.  It would cost approximately &euro;120 million, but the return to the Exchequer would be far greater.  It would also show that we were correcting one of the worst wrongs ever done in this country when the industry was removed. <\/p><p>I thank the Minister for Finance for reducing the tax on lorries to &euro;900.  This is a fantastic initiative that will benefit the whole industry.  The country is involved in moving lots of goods.  This is an exports-based economy and this one move will create a huge spin-off.  Some people may not understand how important this reduction is.  Bringing the tax from &euro;5,000 to &euro;900 makes transport more economical.  It will also address the issue of tractors carrying heavy loads.  Now it will be easier to do so by lorry. <\/p><p>It has been a good budget for SMEs.  It encourages people to get involved in business.  We have more to do, but we are making steps in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500026#Y00200","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1446729000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I too welcome the Finance Bill.  I have been speaking about Finance Bills in one way or another since I was first elected to the council in 1998.  In those days I was dealing with the finances of the local authority.  Here we deal with the finances of the nation.  This is the first budget in eight years that is a little more expansionary and that expansionary focus is welcome, particularly on the capital side where we need to increase spending to build for the future.  Whether it is housing, road infrastructure or broadband, this will ensure we will have a growing economy far into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the maintenance of the home renovation incentive scheme.  This is an excellent scheme which has benefited the small guy, not big property developers associated with Fianna F&aacute;il during the years.  It is a scheme for the small fellow with a small van on the side of the road.  It has allowed people who could not afford to move from a three bedroom to a four bedroom house to extend their properties.  I would have liked to have seen something done for retired people who do not have a mainstream income and are not paying income tax in order that they could benefit from the scheme also.  Perhaps the Minister might look at the possibility of writing off the DIRT being paid on small savings as part of the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I would have liked to have seen more being done on capital gains tax for innovative companies which wish to use their knowledge boxes.  The rate currently stands at 20%, but our competitors, in particular Britain and Northern Ireland, enjoy a 10% rate.  I hope the Minister will signal that his objective is to reduce the 20% rate to 10%.  <\/p>  <p>  The innovation in the new motor tax rate for lorries is extremely welcome.  A number of large companies operate in my constituency.  They provide a service for various industries in the area, including the agriculture and business sectors, by moving material.  It is hoped this change in the rate of road tax will have a knock-on effect to the benefit of the ordinary consumer on the street and that there will be a reduction in the cost of some of the products being shipped. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention one thing the Minister may not be able to deal with directly but perhaps he will become involved in it at EU level.  He said he would like to see every schoolchild have an iPad.  In my area a number of schools, in particular for those just starting off, have introduced iPads.  That kids are not carrying heavy books to school is a welcome innovation.  There is an issue, however, with the VAT rate.  The European Union regards the provision of electronic books as a service.  No VAT applies to hard copies.  If a school is using iPads and downloads books in electronic form, VAT applies at a rate of 23%.  The French and Luxembourgish Governments received a knock back in the European court in seeking to reduce the VAT rate to a lower level for electronic books.  The European Commission is now reviewing VAT laws.  I would like us to make a strong submission to have a VAT rate of 0% applied to electronic books, particularly educational books.  I hope the next time we have a Finance Bill introduced and delivered by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, we will be reducing the VAT rate applied to electronic books to 0%.<\/p>  <p>  The budget is welcome and slightly expansionary, particularly on the capital side, but the capital programmes will deliver.  If we want the economy to keep growing, we need to invest in infrastructure for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500026#Y00300","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1446729600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The Government got the headlines it wanted for the budget.  The minor spat with Professor John McHale did it no harm in that respect.  The budget was described widely as a giveaway budget, including by members of the Opposition.  Unfortunately for the Government, that is not how it is perceived by the majority of ordinary people.  Certainly, the indications in the opinion poll are that people in the Labour Party's base did not consider it a giveaway budget for them.  I believe those people are more accurate than those who wrote the headlines and those who described it as a giveaway budget.<\/p>  <p>  It is a giveaway budget for some, such as high earners and big business, and the continuation of a giveaway to the bondholders, but it is not a giveaway for working class people, middle and low income earners and people on social welfare.  We saw in the rhetoric surrounding the budget a further step up in the Thatcherisation of the discourse of the Government regarding work and unemployment, with the suggestion that this was a budget for work and that we have a Government for work, just as the Labour Party presents itself as a party of work.  This is about the demonisation of the unemployed and trying to get a benefit from some higher paid sections of society.  The details in the Finance Bill confirm that assessment of the budget.<\/p>  <p>  It is the fifth regressive budget in a row.  It takes some doing by a government that includes the Labour Party to manage to transfer wealth, year on year, from the majority to the small rich minority.  The income gap between rich and poor has been expanded by over &euro;500 per year, and over the past two years it has been expanded by over &euro;1,000.  One can compare more extreme examples.  When one compares a single unemployed person with a person earning &euro;75,000 per year the gap is even more incredible.  The single unemployed person gets &euro;95 per year, which is &euro;2 per week, and the person on &euro;75,000 gets &euro;900 per year, which is &euro;17 per week.<\/p>  <p>  The Government could do with being reminded of what an average income is in this State.  It often talks about middle income earners as if the average person in the State earns approximately &euro;70,000 or more each year, that is, the people at whom these budgets are aimed.  Obviously, that serves a purpose in terms of the propaganda the Government is trying to get across.  However, half of the people in this State earn less than &euro;28,500 per year, and half of the people earn more than that.  The reality is that middle income is between &euro;25,000 and &euro;40,000 per year.  Those people got very little from the cuts to the USC.  Somebody on the average income of &euro;28,500 got an extra &euro;5 per week.  If they are in private rented accommodation, that is wiped out.  If they were paying the water charges, which thankfully they are unlikely to do, it would be gone.  It is also gone if they are paying the property tax.  If they are suffering under all of the effects of the continuing austerity in health and education, and in some cases being pushed into the private sector in those areas, it would be gone.  There is no giveaway budget from the point of view of low or middle income workers.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the increase in the minimum wage, any increase is welcome.  It is the first increase in the minimum wage in eight years.  Our minimum wage is still 25% lower than the living wage of &euro;11.50 per hour.  The living wage is calculated on what a single person with no children basically needs to survive.  There are huge numbers of people - one in four workers - living in deprivation as a result of being in work.  In many of the homeless couples who seek my help one of the people will be in work.  There is a flowering of low pay, short-term, precarious contracts and this budget does little to deal with it.  It says it is okay to have a minimum wage that is 25% below what is needed simply to survive.<\/p>  <p>  Then one looks at what was given, or not given, to people on social welfare, which is still a substantial section of the population.  They got nothing, aside from a Christmas bonus.  An extra &euro;1.81 per week is all that was given to people who are finding it extremely hard to get by.  In many cases they will be in the private rented sector, so they are given effectively nothing.  That is the impact of the budget and this Finance Bill from the point of view of the majority.<\/p>  <p>  Contrast the Government's approach to social welfare with its approach to corporate welfare in the budget.  Approximately &euro;15 billion is spent each year by the State on various elements of corporate welfare.  It is huge expenditure.  One never hears about corporate welfare fraud, wasters on corporate welfare or the like.  That language is reserved for unemployed people.  Corporate welfare was increased again in this budget.  There is a cut in capital gains tax from 33% to 20% for SME owners selling their business for a capital gain of &euro;1 million.  Most small business owners are not selling their businesses for &euro;1 million, whereby they can take advantage of this.  This applies to the larger SMEs.<\/p>  <p>  There is no increase in the bank levy, which remains at only &euro;150 million per year.  Banks can still write off the losses incurred during the crash, and bailed out by us, against their profits for corporation tax purposes.  This means many of the banks will not be paying any taxes on their profits for years to come.  In the case of Bank of Ireland, that is over &euro;1 billion that it will not pay.  There are also two cuts to employers' PRSI.<\/p>  <p>  The cherry on the cake in the project of corporate welfare is the so-called knowledge development box.  The knowledge development box is a replacement for the double Irish arrangement.  It is a means of legal tax avoidance by the major multinational corporations, the developmental model employed by this and previous Governments.  That model is about engaging in tax competition across the world to attract multinationals to this country, regardless of the impact on society, employment or anything else.  It basically seeks to get them here with an offer that they pay no tax.  There is a headline rate of 12.5%, but they do not pay anywhere that amount.  Apple, Google, Facebook and so forth are paying approximately one tenth of that, or less.  Now we are introducing a new regime with the knowledge development box, modelled on the British model, to facilitate them paying even less.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that this will cost &euro;50 million.  That is equivalent to all of the increase in capital spend on housing in the budget.  If that had not been introduced, the Government could have doubled that capital spend.  Furthermore, will this figure expand?  Will it cost more than &euro;50 million this year?  Will we be budgeting for &euro;100 million for the next year and &euro;200 million for the following year?  Will this become the scheme that is central to selling Ireland as an attractive location for big multinationals, on the basis that they will not actually have to pay their corporation tax here?<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the petroleum production tax.  It appears to be a marginal improvement.  However, if anything it highlights the incredible giveaway that has taken place in this State, particularly under the change of terms under former Minister, Ray Burke, and former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, whereby Shell, Statoil and other major multinational oil companies, really dirty big oil companies, were told they could have oil and gas for nothing.  There are approximately 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent in Irish waters.  At today's low prices that is worth approximately &euro;1 trillion.  Ireland has one of the most attractive regimes in the world in terms of a lack of taxation, a lack of royalties and so forth.  Companies are allowed to write off all their exploration costs and so forth against their corporation tax.  This tax will not change that.  It will not make a fundamental difference.<\/p>  <p>  Successive governments have presided over a massive giveaway of huge amounts of natural resources and have denied that they were there.  We must have an alternative.  That involves taking them into democratic public ownership, developing a State exploration company and, in particular, having a responsible attitude to what amount of oil and gas is taken from the ground.  This world does not need more fossil fuels and we might be better off leaving it there.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude, there was and remains an alternative.  All the Thatcherite dogma of the Government is simply not true.<\/p><p>The AAA budget statement outlined how the Government could have reversed all of the cuts that have taken place in health, education and social welfare, and cut the regressive taxes on ordinary people, and it could have done it by going after the wealth that exists in our society through income tax, financial transaction tax, millionaire's tax, corporation tax and so on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500027#Z00100","speaker":"1197","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446730200,"counter":337,"content":"<p>This Government&rsquo;s budgetary strategy continues to prioritise high earners and industry at the expense of vulnerable people, people on low incomes and those on social welfare.  Despite a few relatively positive initiatives in the Bill, such as the increase to the home carer tax credit, the fuel grant for disabled drivers and country by country reports on parent companies filing their tax returns, there is actually very little in the Bill that attempts to reform our current tax system and make it reflective of a fairer, more equal society.<\/p>  <p>  I would be na&iuml;ve in thinking this would ever be Fine Gael or Labour&rsquo;s way.  I do, however, want to counter the argument that the Bill is a progressive one.  I will start with the notion that the new petroleum production tax is a progressive measure when, in fact, the Government took the option that affected industry the least.  I sat on the Oireachtas committee on communications, energy and natural resources and I read the report on oil and gas exploration published in 2012, which recommended that, on smaller-scale petroleum fields, the tax should be 40%.  The Government proposes a rate of 30% in the Finance Bill, which is giving effect to a decision made by the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources last year.  That 30% is 10% less than the recommendations of the joint committee.  Worse still, the report recommended that for large profitable fields, the tax should be 80%, but the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in this Bill puts the maximum tax on productive fields at 55%.  It would not be fitting to call this a progressive tax as it is far removed from the committee recommendations, where rates were in line with the INDECON report findings.  It is also a perfect example of the Government&rsquo;s loyalty ultimately lying with industry and compromising its policies to kowtow to industry needs.<\/p>  <p>  Another anomaly in the Bill is in regard to the annual stamp duty charge of &euro;2.50 on ATM and debit cards, which is being abolished from 1 January 2016, when it will be replaced with a new 12 cent ATM withdrawal fee.  While this might seem progressive, it will impact most on those who do their business through cash transactions and will also attack vital services such as the post offices, which work mainly through cash transactions.  What we should do in the Finance Bill is make it cheaper for retailers to do their business.  There should be incentives to support post offices, alongside the introduction of this measure.  That would show the Government is serious about economic recovery across rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the supports and tax benefits in the Bill are oriented towards the tech giants, which get preferential treatment for bringing in the jobs and putting Ireland on the global tech map.  When will we see progressive policies to bring about indigenous industries that do not end up getting bought out or exported?  Fostering local industry and alternative industries like biomass and renewable production has the potential to grow local and sustainable rural jobs.  These industries would foster companies that could be established in peripheral counties, like Donegal and the counties of the western seaboard.  The introduction of the tax exemption for the felling of trees will actually benefit larger operators more than the family farmers in the forestry industry.<\/p>  <p>  A first step could have been introducing a measure in this Bill that would prioritise the rollout of broadband to rural peripheral areas, working its way from rural areas into urban areas and offering scope for people to create their own jobs and grow their businesses.  The impact broadband connectivity could have on the growth of SMEs and start-ups in rural constituencies in Donegal and across the country is huge.  ISME recently published statistics stating that only 14% of SMEs are currently capable of fully trading online, while a further 8% can take orders but not payments online.  This presents small businesses and potential start-ups with a disadvantage and should have been reflected in this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of initiatives such as the knowledge development box, providing for a 6.25% rate of corporation tax for multinationals which avail of it, is basically another way of assisting them to avoid tax and avoid paying their fair share.  We could have included in the Bill a measure to introduce a minimum effective corporation tax rate across the economy, for example, setting a minimum effective rate of 6% on corporations, which would be less than half of the headline figure of 12.5% and would bring an extra &euro;1 billion into the Exchequer.  This could then be used to the advantage of many people across the country.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue with capital gains tax for farmers whose land is subject to a compulsory purchase order, CPO.  I ask the Minister to consider exempting the purchase of land through CPO from capital gains tax.  In these cases, the farmers are not looking to gain on their asset; instead the asset is being taken from them without their consent and being compulsorily purchased.  There is no doubt this is done to progress vital infrastructure projects such as road developments.  However, I do not believe farmers should be penalised by having capital gains tax levied on the income from the CPO.  It is different when someone sells an asset in order to profit from it and in such cases this should attract a tax liability.<\/p>  <p>  On an issue that affects the Border area, where one partner of a separated couple has custody of the children in the Six Counties and the other partner lives in the South and has access to the children, they are not able to avail of the single person tax credit.  This should have been dealt with in the Bill.  While it does not affect a huge number of people, for those it does affect, it has a big impact on their ability to support their children when living outside the State.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond the packages outlined in the Bill, the Government has missed an opportunity to present a more progressive stance on the areas of taxation and regional development.  While the USC increase in tax credit to &euro;13,000 means that 700,000 people will be taken out of the USC net, and this is good for them, it shows we are focused on a low pay economy in this State.  Some 700,000 workers represents about 35% of the entire workforce and this highlights the low income focus of this Government and the number of people who are struggling.  Instead of finding quality jobs for people to work in, and making the transition to get that work easier, the Government is subsidising low income jobs.  We are developing into a low pay economy and it means rural areas like Donegal will remain with incomes well below the national average.  I do not believe this is progressive but we should not have expected anything better from the current Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500028#AA00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1446730200,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Deputy John Deasy is sharing time with Deputies Patrick O'Donovan and Michelle Mulherin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500028#AA00300","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1446730200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I would like to talk about the knowledge development box and the issues surrounding foreign direct investment.  It is fair to say we needed to do something once the Government agreed to abolish the double Irish tax relief, which is being phased out over five years.  The partial solution arrived at is the knowledge development box, otherwise called a patent box.  It is nothing new.  Other countries have used and are using them.  It amounts to a tax relief based on the amount of innovation and research a company undertakes.  We already have an R&amp;D credit which allows for a rebate on salaries.  My understanding is the new relief will strictly adhere to the OECD guidelines.  This is important, because it can only apply to intellectual property developed in Ireland domestically and will allow a company to lessen its tax bill on its profits.  Therefore, it is fairly narrow and, on the face of it, does not seem to match even remotely the potential downside of ending the incentive of the double Irish tax relief, however one feels about that tax relief.<\/p>  <p>  The fact companies will not be able to claim relief for research and innovation outside the jurisdiction but within their own company makes the impact of this fairly limited.  It will, of course, be of interest to some companies, but we have to ask ourselves whether it will have mass appeal to multinationals.  The answer is \"No\", one of the reasons being that many other countries, particularly in Europe, are doing exactly the same thing.  For example, the Dutch patent box has an effective rate of 4% to 5% whereas the rate in the Finance Bill is some 6.5%.<\/p><p>Why are we doing this if it has a limited impact?  I believe the answer has to do with the controversy that surrounds companies like Apple and Google paying little or no tax, which has not gone away yet.  It probably seemed wise to make some changes to try to avoid repercussions down the line before the idea of a consolidated European tax base rears its head again.  This leaves us in a situation where in four years' time, when we arrive at a level playing field, we may be as attractive, or unattractive, as every other European country in this regard.<\/p> <p> This brings me to the matter of Paddy Cosgrave and the web summit.  I listened to Mr. Cosgrave on \"Morning Ireland\" on Tuesday and since then, I have heard him described as being petulant and lecturing.  My first impression was that senior civil servants would not be used to being spoken to as they were and certainly would not like being questioned in that manner and I am around long enough to be aware of that.  However, when we analyse what Mr. Cosgrave sought, it was not so mad at all.  In fact, his WiFi and traffic management requests seem downright reasonable.  He may have been a bit in the face of civil servants used to dealing with people in the old style of \"Begging your pardon, Sir\" but we should remember what this man has done.  He co-founded an event that has grown from 400 people to 40,000 in four years and he probably did not achieve this by being pushover.<\/p> <p> This country is not yet in a position where we can afford to lose this kind of business.  Why were other countries allowed the opportunity to poach this summit?  It is clear we did not take the organisers of the web summit seriously when they threatened to pull out.  Ten years ago, we were the ones poaching business from other countries.  We had the edge and grabbed the multinationals and landed them, in the face of intense competition from around the world.  As a country, we still act as if we are significantly larger and richer than we are.  I guess that if the web summit scenario occurred in the United States, it would have been dealt with swiftly, face to face and there would have been no need for the million e-mails between Mr. Cosgrave and the Department of the Taoiseach.  Looking in from the outside, I think what was needed in this situation was common sense, a bit of pragmatism and a desire to solve the problem. <\/p> <p> This brings me to the issue of problem solving in the context of industrial development.  This fits in with my view that we must adapt to attract foreign investment.  Take for example the situation in which I have found myself in my home town of Dungarvan.  For the past six months or so, we have been attempting to get the IDA to take over an empty factory in Dungarvan.  This project was initiated when the IDA was testifying at the Committee of Public Accounts.  We put a proposal to the IDA to have the building included in its property portfolio in order to market it abroad.  This proposal has progressed but some horse trading needs to be done, amounting to a cost of approximately &euro;200,000.  We have a tender to refit ready to go and the submission has been made to the IDA but we need somebody to make a decision.  We are beginning to feel a little like Paddy Cosgrave - a million e-mails but no action.  The organisation involved in this idea is a good one and is headed by somebody who is highly regarded.  I called him about this issue and he called me back but we have not yet met.  Issues like this take too long to resolve.  I need somebody in a senior position in the IDA to sit down and make a deal with my county manager and somebody to come up with an arrangement, to be done with it and  to move on.  Too many e-mails are sent but too few decisions are made.<\/p> <p> The budget announced a regional building programme for the foreign direct investment alluded to in this Bill.  That is great but in the case of the project in Dungarvan, we already have the building.  If we had to cost an equivalent new build, it would amount to approximately &euro;1.5 million.  Where are we going in regard to this?  The Government needs to take an interdepartmental look at how attractive or unattractive we may be in a few years, based on changes in our tax code and pressure from the European Commission and the OECD.  It must also take a look at decision-making and at how it interfaces with local authorities and those involved in private industry in this country.<\/p> <p> The development of the knowledge development box is useful but limited.  We will need to come up with a lot more if we are to make up for the ending of the double Irish tax relief.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500028#AA00400","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446730800,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I wish to draw attention to the amateur theatrics we had here less than an hour ago and to the false indignation and so-called concern in regard to the Finance Bill and the time allocated for this debate.

They will come in and huff and puff about the level of debate on this Bill but it is not important enough for either of their spokespersons to be in attendance.  As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said earlier regarding the discourse on Second Stage, he would encourage Members to get into more detailed discussion on Committee Stage.  They, of course, went through the motions of their false indignation and outrage but now when push comes to shove, they do not even turn up here.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill and the provisions announced in the budget.  Much of what was in the Budget Statement has carried over into the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill.  There is not doubt that this is a bad day to be in Opposition.  Anybody who would have said four and a half years ago that we would be presenting a budget and set of financial measures now that reclaim many of the difficult impositions enforced on people following the mess the country was landed into by the previous Government would have had to be forgiven for engaging in wishful thinking.  However, that is what we are doing.  We are in a situation where the hated universal social charged introduced by the previous Government is being reduced and where the effective rate of tax is less than 50% for the first time in a long time.<\/p><p>Other tax measures are also being taken, for example, measures regarding taxes that affect the self-employed and farmers.  Farmers play an important role in my constituency and the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal<\/i>summed up how the budget would be perceived in rural areas with its banner headline, &quot;Farmers' Budget&quot;.Farmers are the backbone of many of our constituencies and some Members bemoan the constant running down of rural communities.  The economy of rural communities is being driven very effectively by what is happening inside the farm gate and this has had a knock-on effect in recent months and years outside the farm gate.<\/p><p>I only need to look at my native town of Newcastle West to see this.  Following State and private investment in the past 12 months, confidence is returning to the area.  This is mirrored in towns across the mid west and is driven by the large urban centre in Limerick.  It is no coincidence that the Minister for Finance has his eye very much on the ball in regard to the work being done in the mid west, particularly in regard to Shannon Airport and Foynes, and is aware how the economy can be driven forward with investment through the capital plan.<\/p><p>This is probably a bad day from the point of view of the Opposition, because the Bill contains none of many of the measures it sought, such as flat taxes, land taxes, tax on work and increases in the USC and employers' PRSI.  None of this was needed.  Instead, in simple terms the Minister delivered a budget that provides that everybody who works will be better off to the tune of an additional week's take-home pay.<\/p><p>That is a lot and will be welcomed by anyone who has looked back over the last four years.  Previous speakers have alluded to the Bill itself.  I compliment Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy John McGuinness, who summed up the value of the Minister for Finance and the legislative end of the Bill.  He was very positive, unlike some of his colleagues who were engaged in opposition for opposition's sake.<\/p> <p> There is an issue for disabled drivers which needs to be examined.  Several people have referred to it already.  I had a case recently of a blind civil servant who was relying on his parent to take him to work, until the point at which the parent was no longer in a position to drive him.  He works in County Clare.  Under the current rules, a blind person is not eligible for the disabled drivers' tax exemption.  Through his good offices, the Minister for Finance was able to accommodate a very important issue in this but more needs to be done to flesh it out.  What greater disability could one have in terms of getting to work than not being able to see?  If people are to be encouraged to have an active, normal role in the community and a full life, they should be encouraged to work.  In the case of a blind person who needs a car to get to work, the exemption should be available for a family member, carer or trusted driver.  I ask that this measure be considered.<\/p> <p> There are now 700,000 fewer people paying the USC.  Deputy Pringle was right in welcoming this, but then decided he was going to have a go at it.  Maybe he would prefer the people to be back paying the USC.  He might have an issue with the current Government exempting them.  Government measures such as the Low Pay Commission, the increase in the minimum wage announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Action Plan for Jobs and the 1.5% reduction in several bands of the USC will make a real difference in houses where there are low-paid people.  Like the measures for the self-employed and hauliers, on whom we all depend to transport goods around the country, these are real, tangible improvements.<\/p> <p> I do not want to take any more time from Deputy Mulherin.  I welcome the Bill.  Its provisions show that the recovery is working.  I challenge all of the representative organisations - farmers, employers, unions and everybody who meets us over in Buswell's hotel in the weeks running up to the budget - to start looking at everybody's proposals.  They should look at those of the Fine Gael and Labour Government and those of the Opposition with its land taxes and everything else and do an honest appraisal.  They should then advise their members as to what should and should not be done to continue the recovery.  It is fragile, very open and susceptible to outside shocks.  The biggest outside shock the recovery could get is from the Opposition benches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500029#BB00200","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446731400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome the opportunity to speak.  The Finance Bill takes cognisance of so many issues on which we have been lobbied, as Deputy O'Donovan has said.  The pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced, there are provisions on child care, more people have been taken out of the USC net, income tax is reduced and so on.  Money is being put into services.  It was not concocted overnight; the Government and the backbenchers have been listening.  There has been dialogue with stakeholders and individuals.  On the whole, it is a very hopeful budget and the Finance Act will fulfil that.<\/p>  <p>  One area which needs a very focused approach is the situation regarding our market towns.  This is particularly obvious in rural Ireland but also applies throughout the country, as I know from talking to backbench Government Deputies.  There has been a lot of investment in farming and we have a dynamic Minister in Deputy Coveney but that is all inside the farm gate.  Market town centres throughout my own County of Mayo are dilapidated.  A number of years ago there were people living in these towns and the places were buzzing, but very few live in them now.  We see old townhouses, very fine commercial buildings, in a state of decay.<\/p>  <p>  This did not happen with the collapse of our economy and the banking crisis, it was going on during the Celtic tiger.  Shopping trends changed and people wanted new houses further out.  No matter how good things are in certain areas and how much improvement we see, we go back to the same point.  These monuments of decay, as I call them, are quite depressing.  The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh is a rural representative as well and will have seen it.<\/p>  <p>  We need spatial planning involving perspective and impetus from local government, along with tax breaks to encourage people to come back, do up these properties and live in the towns.  We have, I believe, 200,000 empty private properties in the country, not to mention those owned by local authorities.  A lot of these are in town centres.  An incentive, not investor-developer led but offered to individuals who chose to come back to live in town centres, in the form of either a tax break or a grant, should be seriously considered.  Why would we not want people to live in town centres?  It makes more sense than building out in the country where services and all the rest have to be brought out.  We have fine buildings in the town centres.  Let us take the same approach as all of those lovely European villages we like to visit on holidays in Spain and France.  We should renovate the buildings, put in the facilities and give them some TLC.  We should make town centres vibrant places again, such as people would want to go to.<\/p>  <p>  We also need a reality check.  There is not going to be a corner shop everywhere as retail has changed.  People want to go to multiples and shop online.  We have to be more focused on the niche sectors.  In conjunction with councils, we need to decide what the town centres are and support independent traders and small businesses.  In the UK they took an initiative called the \"Tesco levy\".  Multiples are very welcome here as they provide a lot of employment, but there has to be a balance.  We cannot treat multiples like small independent traders.  We should consider bringing in a similar \"Tesco levy\" which would see multiples such as Tesco, Aldi and so on pay rates on a higher basis than the small independent traders.  Small traders and commercial premises in the centres of towns should then get a reduction in their rates.  Why are they on the same playing field when there is no comparison?  A small shop pays the same amount for its cigarette, wine or petrol license as Tesco.  I do not mean to single out Tesco.  UK studies showed that 50% of money spent in multiples leaves the local economy, while 90% of money spent at small independent traders stays there.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister for Finance on this.  Let us have a vision for rural Ireland and get the local authorities involved.  Let us incentivise and have tax breaks, not for investors or developers but to make a meaningful impression on rural Ireland and give it a boost.  Normal market forces during the Celtic tiger did not help the situation.  Are we going to be forever looking at decay in our town centres?  Let us do something.  Finance and taxation form a crucial part of addressing this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500030#CC00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1446731400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Billy Timmins.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  The budget has, in fairness, tried to reward work and encourage people off the live register and back into employment.  This morning we were circulated with the Department of Social Protection's assessment of the budget, which states that 80% of those unemployed would be substantially better off in work.<\/p><p>There are anomalies in that.  Family income supplement is not being promoted the way it should be.  We need to assist people and show them where the incentives are and where the anomalies are to take them out of the system.  <\/p> <p> I welcome the Minister for Finance's announcement in the budget that retailers will be supported by reducing the processing costs of electronic payments.  This is a welcome development that will support approximately 280,000 jobs in the retail sector, which is the largest sector in the indigenous economy.  However, I cannot understand why this measure is kicking in on 9 December.  The Minister of State knows that 8 December is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception and that on that date, people from the country traditionally came to Dublin to do their shopping.  It was always one of the busiest shopping days of the year and yet this particular measure is kicking in the day after.  Things have changed dramatically in recent years and Christmas shopping now starts on 1 December and runs right through to 24 December.  I cannot understand why this measure was not introduced from 1 December.  Why was the date of 9 December picked out of the sky?  I know this is coming in as part of an EU directive and that to a certain extent, the EU is forcing the Government to do it.  In the UK, this measure is being implemented this month.  It is not waiting until December.  I ask the Minister to amend this introduction date and give retailers an additional boost by allowing this to commence from 1 December.  This additional boost would be approximately &euro;1.4 million in savings to retailers across this country, many of whom are struggling to keep their doors open.  It would be a significant support for them in the run up to the Christmas period and would help and promote electronic transactions, so I again ask the Minister to look at this issue before this Bill is enacted.  <\/p> <p> The second issue I wish to raise concerns small businesses and access to cash flow.  The difficulty is that some clients of small businesses know that once the service has been provided or the work has been done, it is very difficult for the debtor to get the money out of that client, particularly if the value is less than &euro;2,000.  The person who is owed the money has two choices.  They can write it off as a bad debt or take legal action.  They must then go through the courts and pay a solicitor's fee and there is no guarantee that at the end of this process, they will actually get paid, so many of them end up writing it off as a bad debt.  I suggest that we open up a small claims court to deal specifically with these small debts of less than &euro;2,000.  If a business is owed &euro;200 by ten companies, that is a week's wages and there is nothing that business can do to access that money.  It would be a significant step forward in supporting local small businesses in improving their credit flow.  <\/p> <p> I know that the Minister for Finance was very critical yesterday of Bank of Ireland, as were other members of the Government.  Bank of Ireland basically does not want cash customers any more.  I am in possession of a provision under the mandatory electronic filing and payment of tax regulations of 2014 from the Revenue Commissioners.  A letter was sent to a 75 year old widow who is severely arthritic in her limbs and joints telling her she would face a fine of &euro;1,520 if she failed to make her tax returns by electronic means.  This woman has never switched on a computer, let alone used one.  She has no Internet and no computer skills or training.  At the bottom of the letter, it states that Revenue may exclude a taxpayer from their obligation to file and pay electronically if the taxpayer applies for this.  However, it does not make sense to send letters like this to pensioners.  This woman is 75 years of age and is getting over the loss of her husband who did all her financial transactions.  Now she must cope with making tax returns and receives a letter from the Revenue Commissioners demanding she makes an electronic return when she does not even know where to access a computer.  We need to look at the approach that is being taken right across Government and society in trying to force people who are not electronically literate, and who may not even be literate, down this road, regardless of whether it is the banks or the Revenue Commissioners.  There should be an easy and accessible mechanism to get a waiver in respect of this rather than having to write in and apply.  Many people, particularly those who have not been used to this up to now, tend to panic once they get the letter from the Revenue Commissioners.  I urge the Minister to withdraw this letter, which has been sent out to quite a number of older people across the country.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  While the Minister is correctly lecturing Bank of Ireland about what it is doing, he has a responsibility to ensure that his Department and the agencies under its control do not send out letters such as this.  I hope that on Committee Stage, an amendment is tabled so that this particular regulation is redrafted in a responsible manner, taking into consideration those people who are receiving these letters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500030#CC00300","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446732000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>The Deputy must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500031#DD00200","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1446732000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I have another two minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500031#DD00300","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1446732000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>It is 2.17 p.m. and I should have called on the Minister of State to reply at 2.15 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500031#DD00400","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1446732000,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I will conclude.<\/p><p>This is the first &quot;others&quot; slot on the Finance Bill.

From what I have seen of local authorities, with the best will in the world, they will not solve the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500032#EE02100","speaker":"1207"},{"type":"speech","time":1446732600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500032#EE02200","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1446732600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>Three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500032#EE02300","speaker":"1091"},{"type":"speech","time":1446732600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the introduction to the new Kildare-Wicklow two minutes.<\/p><p>I will not have time to cover all the points but I will try my best. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500032#EE02400","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1446732600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>On a point of order, where is the Minister for Finance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500032#EE02500","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1446732600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I do not have a clue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500032#EE02600","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1446732600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>It is customary that the Minister for Finance would wrap up the Second Stage debate and address many of the points that Deputies have raised.

The Minister notes that the bank has given a commitment to assist more vulnerable customers in their branches and he does expect the bank to honour fully this commitment and ensure that customers will be facilitated through the existing arrangements where required.<\/p>  <p>  In reference to Deputy Michael McGrath&rsquo;s proposal for a White Paper on banking, this Government already has a banking strategy that is working.  The successful outcome of this policy can be seen in the annual increases of new sustainable lending to households, small and medium enterprises, SMEs and industry.  It is particularly important that the increase in new lending is occurring in tandem with a reduction in the overall stock of debt due to the risk posed by high levels of private indebtedness to our economy.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath referred also to the Central Bank and its guidelines.  The purpose of these new macro prudential measures is to mitigate systemic risk and promote financial stability, to increase the resilience of the banking sector and households to the property market and to reduce the risk of credit spirals from developing in the future.  These new measures are a crucial and fundamental part of the new more intrusive bank regulatory framework put in place to prevent future systemic banking problems.  There is, of course, an appropriate balance to be struck.  The Central Bank recognises this, and is committed to monitoring the operation of the system on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the Bill itself and further to Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s suggestions in relation to the indexation of the standard rate bands, this was an option Minister Noonan considered in the course of his budget deliberations.  In view of the limited fiscal space available, he chose instead to focus the budget package on reduction of the three lowest USC bands, as this benefitted every taxpayer with USC-liable income of &euro;12,012 and above.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath asked for an estimate of the number of additional taxpayers who will enter into the higher tax rate as a result of wage inflation, who would not have done so if the rate bands had increased by &euro;400 per person.  The Revenue Commissioners have estimated that such an increase would remove approximately 10,000 income earners, each earning over &euro;33,800, from the 40% rate in 2016, at a maximum benefit of &euro;80 per person.  The Minister would, however, note that these same individuals will see a benefit of &euro;227 per annum as a result of the cut in the 7% USC rate to 5.5%, which will apply from 2016 on incomes from &euro;18,668.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies McGrath and Murphy noted that the earned income credit falls short of full equality, and the Minister agrees that significant differences remain between the taxation of employees and the self-employed.  However, some of these differences are to the benefit of the self-employed and any attempt to equalise fully the positions of the employed and self-employed would need to be examined carefully.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath also asked about the measures taken by Revenue to ensure that qualifying families receive the home carer tax credit, which the Minister has increased in this budget to &euro;1,000.  Revenue has, for a number of years, taken steps to allow automatically the credit wherever possible, including the use of data received from the Department of Social Protection on child benefit payments.<\/p><p> A number of Deputies, including Deputies Pearse Doherty, Richard Boyd Barrett and Clare Daly, questioned why taxpayers with incomes of &euro;70,000 and over would benefit from the budget.  Ireland has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world, something which we know these Deputies support.  A progressive system ensures the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay.  Following the budget 2016 changes, it is estimated that the top 25% of income earners will pay 81% of total USC and income tax revenue, while the top 1% of income earners will pay 22%.  In this regard, Deputy Eoghan Murphy's comments on the influence of high marginal tax rates on the economic cycle and job creation must also be borne in mind.<\/p> <p> It is also important to point out that the effects of the budget package as a whole, including both taxation and social welfare expenditure measures, must be taken into account when examining distributional impacts.  The Minister draws Deputies' attention to the social impact assessment of the budget.  This analysis shows higher than average gains for the bottom two quintiles, or fifths, of income distribution, while the smallest gain is in the top quintile.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Michael McGrath raised some issues in connection with the capital acquisitions tax changes announced in the budget and the yield from this tax.  As part of budget 2016, the Minister raised the group A tax free threshold applying to gifts and inheritances from parents to their children from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000.  This represents an increase of about 25%.  The Deputy says inheritance tax is forcing people to sell the family home.  There is an exemption from CAT to ensure that, subject to certain conditions, those inheriting the family home in which they live can do so tax free.  The Deputy made reference to a particular condition of the relief, but that condition only applies in the case of gifts, not inheritances, and is in place to prevent abuse of the exemption.  The Minister has, however, indicated that he sees the change to the group A tax free threshold in the budget as the start of a process.<\/p> <p> Deputy Pearse Doherty made reference to the provisions of section 39 of the Bill and seemed to have an impression that some form of capital gains tax concession was being provided for individuals disposing of valuable houses.  That is not the case.  Section 39 amends an anti-avoidance provision which is in place to ensure non-resident sellers of certain assets in the State, including houses, cannot escape liability to CGT on such disposals.  Such individuals will only receive a clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners where they are satisfied that either there is no liability or that a liability will be paid where it arises.<\/p> <p> Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned the high earner's restriction and the forestry amendment.  The Minister agrees with the Deputy that it is important that this measure remain a strong restriction on high earning individuals.  In this instance he is satisfied that the amendment can be justified when viewed against the overall benefits.  He notes also the Deputy's comments on the additional tier 1,  AT1, capital.  The new bank regulatory capital requirements are prompting banks to issue AT1 capital instruments as part of their capital reserves.  As these instruments have characteristics of both debt and equity, there is a need to explicitly provide for their treatment as debt.  The Minister notes that the Deputy commented on the withholding tax issues.  The requirement to operate DWT on these instruments would limit the tradeability of AT1 instruments.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies also addressed the employment and investment incentive.  The particular issues about which Deputies have concerns are not fully clear, but the Minister hopes to discuss the scheme in significant detail on Committee Stage.  <\/p> <p> Several Deputies, including Deputies John Paul Phelan, Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Richard Boyd Barrett, referred to the recent increase in CT receipts.  Corporation tax in Ireland is highly concentrated, with a high proportion of receipts coming from the multinational sector.  We have been advised that the increased corporation tax from the multinational sector is attributable to a variety of reasons, including improved trading conditions and positive currency fluctuations.  Furthermore, it is fair to say the improvement is relatively broad based, with improved receipts in other sectors and across different sized firms.  For example, there has been an increase of over 20% in the number of companies paying between &euro;100,000 and &euro;1 million.  There has also been an increase of about 20% in the amount of tax paid by medium-sized companies.<\/p> <p> Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Clare Daly raised concerns about the knowledge development box, which is simply replacing the so-called \"double Irish\".  Let me, first, be clear that Ireland is not a tax haven.  Our competitive rate of corporation tax has been an important part of our industrial policy since the 1950s and has attracted real and substantive operations to Ireland since.  Ireland does not encourage the establishment of so-called \"brass plate\" operations which seek simply to avail of our competitive corporate tax rate.  The Minister has always been clear that the double Irish was not part of the Irish tax offering and was just one example of the many international tax planning arrangements which have been designed and developed by tax and legal advisers to take advantage of mismatches between the tax rules in two or more countries.<\/p> <p> In contrast to the double Irish, the knowledge development box, KDB, is a positive measure for Ireland.  Putting in place an attractive tax offering for intangible assets is, therefore, important to encourage companies to develop their knowledge-based capital in Ireland and for our success in attracting foreign direct investment, but the KDB is not all about the multinational sector.  Contrary to what Deputy Pearse Doherty said, because of the operation of the OECD modified nexus formula, the KDB will be of most benefit to single companies which carry out their research and development activities in Ireland.  In addition, the Government has committed that an additional category of qualifying assets will be available to give particular support to small companies and ensure they will be able to access the KDB.<\/p> <p> A number of Deputies, including Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, raised the matter of the eligibility criteria for the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme.  This is not a matter to be dealt with in the Finance Bill as the criteria are provided in secondary legislation.  However, the Department of Finance reviews tax expenditures regularly and in that context, the Minister will take cognisance of the points raised.  <\/p> <p> I will conclude by noting, as the Minister mentioned in his opening statement, that there are still a small number of matters under consideration for inclusion on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500032#EE03100","speaker":"997","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1446733800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 69; N\u00edl, 41.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe; N\u00edl, Deputies Aengus \u00d3 Snodaigh and Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Feargha\u00edl.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500034#GG00100","aye":["1062","980","974","1079","989","1029","1030","1042","975","1092","988","1031","972","1041","1087","1006","986","1091","1046","968","1075","1011","1103","1105","1068","1051","1076","1089","949","1097","973","1033","1012","1098","1088","1021","1110","1053","982","1023","1180","1000","997","1082","977","1026","1004","1070","985","1034","1067","1177","1056","1045","1018","1058","1069","1073","971","1063","1081","966","947","952","1013","961","978","950","1024"],"nay":["1199","1003","1190","1096","1071","1193","1083","1195","1204","1037","1192","959","1201","976","1047","1198","1206","1050","1094","954","983","945","1040","998","1017","993","965","981","1202","1197","1044","1054","1028","1005","1001","953","970","1207","1080","1065","956"]},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Social Welfare Bill 2015: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1446734100,"counter":387,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500035#HH00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1446734100,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1446734100,"counter":389,"content":"<p>A new analysis of the budget changes shows that households with children are the biggest beneficiaries of budget 2016 and, in particular, working lone parents.  There will also be an increase in the monthly rate of child benefit to &euro;140 from January 2016, which sees further increases on top of increases in budget 2015.  The family income supplement threshold is also being increased by &euro;5 for each of the first two children per week from January.  That will give an additional &euro;3 or &euro;6 per week for low-income working families in receipt of this support.  I am also pleased to see an increase in top-up payments for jobseekers availing of community employment, rural social scheme, job initiative and other such schemes.<\/p>  <p>  There are also elements of budget 2016 which do not require changes to legislation.  They include: the increase in the fuel allowance; the increase in funding for the free travel scheme; an increase of &euro;2.50 per week in top-up payments for community employment, rural social scheme, Gateway, job initiative, T&uacute;s and JobBridge participants; and an increase in funding for the school meals scheme, to support school-going children in disadvantaged areas.<\/p>  <p>  The budget measures which require amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 are provided for in the Social Welfare Bill 2015.  This Bill will implement the budgetary changes which are, in the main, due to come into force in early 2016 and will also give effect to increases in pensions payable to persons aged 66 and over and their qualified adult dependents, as well as increases to the rate of child benefit, respite care grant and family income supplement.<\/p>  <p>  The new tapered PRSI credit for class A PRSI employees earning between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424 in a week will reduce the weekly PRSI bill for more than 88,000 employees and will be in addition to the gains from the USC changes announced on budget day.

That is what this Bill is about.  It is the most miserable bit of legislation that has been brought before us.  We are saying to elderly people that we will give them a miserable &euro;3 and that they should be grateful.  People are not grateful and it is important the Government appreciates that.  All one had to do was meet people on the morning following the budget and ask what they thought.  All they said was, \"Three miserable euro\".  That is the hallmark of the Social Welfare Bill.  The Government almost seems to think people should show it gratitude for the wonderful job it has done and the great improvements that have been made to the economy.  The view seems to be that they are lucky to get something.  The Government is giving them &euro;3.<\/p>  <p>  The sum of &euro;3 would not pay for people's prescriptions charges or water bills.  It is miserable and people know that, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, who might say it is the first increase in a while.  In contrast, even though Fianna F&aacute;il worked within the same very tight financial parameters as the Government on budget day, we felt it was appropriate in our document to talk about a &euro;5 increase and we said where the funding for it would come from.<\/p>  <p>  It is bad enough that the increase was only &euro;3, which is the increase for a single person on the State pension.  Let us look at what the Government did for a couple on the State pension, two elderly people living together.  It will give &euro;3 to the person aged over 66 and a proportionate increase to the person in receipt of the qualified adult allowance.  The allowance is 70% of the primary payment so the second person in the house will get &euro;2.10.  They will not even get the three miserable euro.  The Government is saying to the spouse that &euro;2.10 is all he or she will get.  When one adds the two payments, it is &euro;5.10 between the two.  That is &euro;2.55 per person.  The Government might say it is giving some people &euro;3 but, in reality, most elderly couples in receipt of the pension will get &euro;2.55 each.  One could ask how far that will go towards the payment of prescription charges.  People believe there is a lack of generosity and a lack of spirit.<\/p>  <p>  There is much money in society.  In the past 13 months, the Government announced additional expenditure of &euro;7.3 billion over and above what had been in the previous year&rsquo;s budget.  In October last year, before the budget, the Government said there would have to be a negative adjustment of &euro;2 billion but on budget day, it found an additional &euro;3 billion.  There was not a negative &euro;2 billion adjustment but a positive adjustment of &euro;1 billion in terms of the turnaround of &euro;3 billion the Government announced on budget day just one year and two weeks ago.<\/p>  <p>  Shortly after the Government made an announcement on the &euro;3 billion, it introduced a Supplementary Estimate last year of &euro;1.2 billion.  It was great money.  Prior to this year&rsquo;s budget, the Government made an announcement concerning &euro;1.5 billion.  However, 48 hours before budget day, the Government announced another &euro;1.6 billion in Supplementary Estimates.  I might have missed something but in terms of those particular measures over the past 13 months, the Government has been able to find an extra &euro;7.3 billion.  God knows where the Government has put it because people are not seeing the value of it.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has said to an elderly person living with his or her spouse on the State pension that out of the &euro;7.3 billion, it will give him or her &euro;2.55 a week or &euro;3 if he or she is a widow or widower or a person living on his or her own.  There is not a shortage of funds.  The Government has demonstrated that over the past 13 months.  Nobody can say the Government has been acting in a prudent manner.  It has been spending a lot of money which has come in as windfall gains in taxes.<\/p><p>From where is that money coming?  The Government is increasing, on an ongoing basis, basic permanent expenditure on the basis of windfall taxes and receipts.  Were people to identify any particular mistake that happened during the property boom in the past, it was that expenditure was ramped up on the basis of stamp duty and property tax receipts, that is, once-off stand-alone taxes that were not guaranteed to be repeated in the future.  This is precisely what the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Finance have done this year.  An additional &euro;1.6 billion in corporation tax has been received but the Minister for Finance has no idea why he got it.  Neither he nor anybody else predicted it and there is no guarantee it will carry forward into next year.  It was a once-off increase of &euro;1.6 billion over and above expectations.  Additional income also arose this year from dividends from the Central Bank, which is a carry-over from dealing with the IBRC liquidation issue.  Although such dividends will not carry on into the future but will peter out as time passes, the Government has managed to increase expenditure this year beyond the expenditure ceilings announced on budget day last year.  I note these expenditure ceilings have a legislative basis and the Government has both breached the ceilings for 2015 and the ceilings it has in place for 2016, which it announced 12 months ago.  While I acknowledge the Minister is only required to notify the D&aacute;il when he changes the expenditure ceiling, this is an example of the extra money the Government has had at its disposal.  Expenditure ceilings this year went out the door and expenditure ceilings for next year have gone completely.  Although &euro;7 billion was available, it went on three miserable euro to the State pensioners and they know that.  There was a debate in November between the two Government parties, with one option being to go to the country on foot of the announcement of the budget, after which people would know they would get an increase.  However, the views of others prevailed and it was decided to wait until people actually have the money in their hand next January and to hold a spring election.  While the Government has chosen the latter option, it should not expect gratitude when the married couple in receipt of the State pension receive that miserable &euro;5.10 between them and when they hear of all the money that has been available up to now.<\/p> <p> This budget and the Government's previous budgets have been highly regressive.  Ultimately, the story of the present Administration will be of net regressive budgets.  As I have been highlighting, additional money is available this time but it will not make up for some of the regressive budgets of previous years.  A couple of weeks ago, I sat in this Chamber listening to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and one issue struck me immediately that day, namely, an issue regarding the family income support administered by the Department of Social Protection.  The issue, to which I referred immediately after hearing the statement, is that the budget increases the threshold for family income supplement by &euro;5 for the first child and &euro;10 for the second and subsequent children, apparently to offset the increase in the national minimum wage.  However, the increase in these thresholds is not sufficient given the 50 cent per hour increase in the minimum wage for a person who works a 40-hour week as it would yield an increase of &euro;20 in his or her basic wage, or perhaps &euro;19.50 if such a person works a 39-hour week.  I welcome this increase of 50 cent per hour in the minimum wage and Fianna F&aacute;il at all stages has supported it.  In our submission to the commission in this regard, we actually proposed an increase of 55 cent, which it is a matter of public record.  Fianna F&aacute;il proposed this increase in this calendar year, to come into effect for next year, and that translates to a weekly increase of approximately &euro;20.  However, the Government is increasing the threshold for family income supplement by &euro;5, which I read to mean that many people will be removed from the scope of the family income supplement.  While the detail can be teased out on Committee Stage, on the face of it, the increase in the family income supplement threshold does not match the increase in the minimum wage.  If this is the case, this change must be reversed and that can be teased out in further detail.  If the way in which I am putting this point is not completely correct, the matter can be clarified in due course but on the face of it, given the announcement on budget day, it was reasonable to arrive at the conclusion I reached and which I reiterate today.  If further detail is thrashed out on Committee Stage on this issue, it will represent an improvement on the budget day announcement.  Nevertheless, concern exists that people on low incomes will encounter a difficulty as a result of this measure.  <\/p> <p> In respect of lone parents, the change to the eligibility criteria to qualify for the one-parent family payment that came into effect last July was a particularly callous move on the part of the Government.  There is little in this year's budget from which lone parents can take comfort and this is a matter that again will come up extensively on the doorsteps.<\/p> <p> While there are many items to consider in this budget, one of the biggest issues is that of housing and the rent supplement.  I lay the chaos that exists in housing fairly and squarely at the door of the Labour Party, not on Fine Gael.  Members are aware of what Fine Gael do and we know their type.  They do not care or are not particularly concerned about people on the margins of homelessness, who are not their core people.  However, I would have thought they were core voters of the Labour Party.  In truth, once the top 30% are flying, which they are-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500035#HH00400","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1446734700,"counter":393,"content":"<p>The Deputy is very hard on us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500036#JJ00200","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speech","time":1446734700,"counter":394,"content":"<p>-----Fine Gael will be happy.  However, people expected better from the Labour Party and what is ironic about the homelessness situation is that two Ministers are directly responsible for it.  One is the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, who is the Minister responsible for the legislation under discussion and who is responsible for rent supplement but has not done anything on it.  The second is the Minister with responsibility for housing, who is the Labour Party's deputy leader.  Consequently, the leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party are the two principal Ministers who are responsible for the homelessness situation that has arisen under the Government's watch.  When the Labour Party entered office, there was not a homelessness issue.  I acknowledge there were other issues but this issue arose under its watch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500036#JJ00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1446734700,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il crashed the construction industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500036#JJ00400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1446734700,"counter":396,"content":"<p>All the Minister of State can say about what the Government inherited, along with the financial situation, is that my party in office built too many houses.

This issue will be visited heavily, and rightly so, on the Labour Party.  While Fine Gael Members might not like me saying it, the Fine Gael way is not to worry about such people.  However, it should be the Labour Party's way - not Frankfurt's way but the Labour Party's way.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, has presided over a cut in rent supplement over recent years.  Moreover, the Minister with responsibility for housing stated this time last year that this issue would be his legacy.  He will be leaving a legacy, albeit not the legacy he promised shortly after he came to office as Minister.  He is leaving a legacy of homelessness and the leader and deputy leader of the Labour Party are the two Ministers who could have done something about it.  All Members are aware of the position.  <\/p>  <p>  The Simon Community recently conducted a survey in respect of rental property nationwide and only a tiny percentage of properties available for rent were within rental amounts to which the supplementary welfare allowance could be applied.  In County Laois, not a single property was available for rent on some of the websites that were within the rental amounts of which one could avail if one sought a rental supplement.  This has happened and while I concur that the Minister certainly is leaving a legacy, it is not a legacy of which the Labour Party should be proud.<\/p>  <p>  I also considered many other events that have taken place over the years and I am aware the Minister of State will suggest the Government did not cut basic rates.  However, I refer to the situation of 18 year old people who are on jobseeker's allowance of &euro;100 per week, people up to the age of 24 who are in receipt of &euro;140 per week and people aged 25 who are in receipt of &euro;144 until reaching the age of 26.  These amounts essentially tell such people to head off to Canberra or elsewhere in Australia or to New Zealand, London, Canada or wherever.  This essentially is a one-way ticket for young people.  As for those who are on the live register operated by the Department of Social Protection, those figures ignore the number of people who have emigrated in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015110500036#JJ00900","speaker":"1100"}]
