The national accounts show that exports grew by 13.0 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of this year, with goods exports up nearly 16 per cent. This was not matched by proportionate import growth, despite the growth in domestic demand in the same period. As a result net exports increased by 11.0 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter to stand at &euro;11.2 billion, or 24 per cent of GDP.<\/p><p>  Part of the strong performance in goods exports, shown in the national accounts, can be put down to what is known as contracted manufacturing. This contracted production occurs when an Irish-resident (though not necessarily Irish-owned) enterprise contracts a plant abroad to produce a good for supply to a third country. The sale of the good is recorded as an Irish export, as the economic ownership of the good prior to sale is regarded as belonging to the Irish-resident enterprise. Imports used in the production process are also recorded as Irish imports. Neither these exports nor imports associated with contracted production are recorded in the monthly trade series which is based on measurement of when goods physically cross the Irish border. <\/p><p>  Contracted production involves very little employment effect or second-round impact on the wider economy and complicates the task of forecasting net exports. Developments in contract production are sector-specific and product-specific and have little relationship with concurrent indicators of export performance. As such, they have the potential to unwind or accelerate with potentially large impacts on measured GDP.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding these developments, there is no doubt that economic recovery has gained momentum this year and that it has broadened to include a recovery in domestic demand.  High-frequency data such as retail sales, industrial production and purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) are all in strong positive territory. Employment growth resumed in 2012 and the Live Register continues to fall month-on-month<\/p><p>  As stated above, contract manufacturing is not included in the CSO Monthly trade statistics.  The latest goods exports statistics released by the CSO shows that exports of goods in October 2014 increased by 4% compared to October 2013, while, for the 10 months period to October 2014, exports of goods increased by 2%, compared to the same period for 2013.

Where NERA encounter the sub-contractor model, the question may arise as to whether individuals are employees or self-employed. NERA Inspectors are not in a position to make a final determination regarding employment status.  Rather, this is a matter for both the Department of Social Protection (DSP) and the Revenue Commissioners.  Where NERA inspectors encounter situations in which there is a question over the employment status of an individual, they refer the matter to the relevant authority.  Where either the Department of Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners makes a determination on these issues NERA, in accordance with the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals will generally accept their decisions on the issue. Finally, the matter can also be determined by the courts.  <\/p><p>  NERA has statutory authority to share information with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection. In addition, NERA is a member of the Hidden Economy Monitoring Group, a non-statutory multi-agency group comprising of representatives from business groups, trade unions and State agencies, including the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners, who have a common commitment to tackle the shadow economy. Publicly funded construction projects are subject to ongoing supervision and inspection by the enforcement agencies of the State (i.e. Revenue, DSP and NERA - acting as Joint Inspection Units).<\/p><p>  Workers who consider they are not receiving the National Minimum Wage can make a complaint to NERA, or a Rights Commissioner.

In this context, it is proposed that the term &ldquo;worker&rdquo; will include a person who has entered into or works under a contract with an employer to personally execute any work or labour. The High Court has interpreted the term &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in section 23 as including a subcontractor providing services personally under a contract for service.

Evidence, from both the EU and internationally, shows that the Government&rsquo;s strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our STI investment is paying off.  Globally, we are ranked:<br\/><br\/>- 11th in the Global Innovation Index 2014, out of 142 countries.<br\/><br\/>- 1st in the world for inward investment and quality, as per the IBM Global Location Trends Report of 2013.<br\/><br\/>- 1st in Europe and 2<sup>nd<\/sup>in the world for the number of investment jobs per capita, as per the same report.<br\/><br\/>- 3rd in the EU &lsquo;Indicator of Innovation Output&rsquo;, and<br\/><br\/>- 9th in the European Commission&rsquo;s 2014 Innovation Union Scoreboard. <br\/><br\/>Similarly, Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness continues to improve. Since 2011, Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness rankings in both the IMD and WEF competitiveness reports has improved &ndash; from 24<sup>th<\/sup>to 15<sup>th<\/sup>in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook and from 29<sup>th<\/sup>to 25<sup>th<\/sup>WEF Global Competitiveness Report. <br\/><br\/>All of these factors reflect Ireland&rsquo;s enduring strength as an investment location. Foreign direct investment has been buoyant so far this year, with IDA Ireland securing over 100 investments in the first half of 2014, up from 70 in the same period in 2013, with potential job creation of 8,000. Approximately 40% of these investments came from companies investing in Ireland for the first time, as Ireland&rsquo;s value proposition continues to resonate with new investors. The Government has recently published a Policy Statement on FDI designed to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s inward investment offering continues to be attractive and competitive.<br\/><br\/>On the indigenous side, Enterprise Ireland had a record year for job creation, with 5,442 net new jobs, and exports in 2013 and the outlook is for continued strong export growth for 2014. Furthermore, in 2013 Science Foundation Ireland had links to 65% (2,018 jobs) of the 3,085 jobs announced by the IDA in all fields covered by SFI&rsquo;s legal remit. International companies supported by IDA Ireland added a net 7,071 jobs in 2013 overall, the highest level of job creation in over a decade. Indeed, every job created in one of IDA&rsquo;s client company&rsquo;s results in the creation of 0.7 of a &ldquo;spin-off&rdquo; job in the Irish economy. Indications are that 2014 will be another excellent year for net job creation by IDA and Enterprise Ireland, with significant reliance on innovation.<br\/><br\/>The recently published National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship in Ireland has as its aim to support the creation of an additional 93,000 jobs from start-up companies in the next five years. In addition, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, which is currently under development, provides further opportunity to design actions to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, which will provide the underpinning from a continued strong investment performance.<br\/><br\/>Elsewhere, &lsquo;Knowledge Transfer Ireland&rsquo;, our central Technology Transfer Office, has recently been set up as a central reference point for entrepreneurs and industry, signposting them to the wealth of technology opportunities and academic talent that exist in our Research Performing Organisations.<br\/><br\/>In terms of European Union funding for research and innovation, with a budget of almost &euro;80 billion covering the next seven years, Horizon 2020 offers huge opportunities to researchers, research organisations and industry to engage in cutting edge research.

The question of whether it is appropriate that pensioner groups have access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in pursuing pension scheme grievances has been raised for consideration.<\/p><p>  It should be pointed out that the Trustees of a particular pension scheme are already required by law to act in the best interests of all the members.

My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government recently announced the provision of 260 additional emergency beds in Dublin to be available before Christmas to ensure that any person sleeping rough between now and Christmas will have a bed available should they choose to avail of it.<b><\/b>Arrangements are also being made to provide the necessary accommodation in other urban areas, including Cork where an additional 20 beds are being provided.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the rent supplement scheme, the Department is currently reviewing the maximum rent limits, which will be finalised shortly. I am acutely aware of the difficulties people are experiencing in maintaining affordable rented accommodation in areas of high demand in the current market, including areas of county Meath. However, raising rent limits may not be the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and could impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students. I am keeping the matter under close review.<br\/><br\/>There are approximately 71,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. A breakdown of recipients per county since 2008 is provided in the attached tabular statement. There are currently over 1,700 rent supplement recipients in Meath, of which 520 were awarded this year, which represents over 30% of the total awarded.<br\/><br\/>Emergency actions are being undertaken in the Department through the increased use of flexibility in relation to the administration of the rent limits, including under the Interim Tenancy Sustainment Protocol operating in Dublin. A notice reminding all Community Welfare Service staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy was circulated in July 2014 and a further instruction issued last week.<br\/><br\/>Staff are increasing rent supplement payments as necessary and are actively engaging with the relevant local authorities and local various organisations involved in homelessness. The Department is reviewing the local arrangements in place to strengthen the existing framework to ensure that the necessary supports continue to be provided in a consistent manner. <br\/><br\/>I advise that where a person in receipt of rent supplement is at risk of losing their tenancy they should make contact with the Tenancy Protection Service provided by Threshold in Dublin on 1800 454 454

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. This is particularly important given the challenges to the future sustainability of the State pension, with increased numbers of older people living longer. <br\/><br\/>When assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension (contributory), and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (whether paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account.<br\/><br\/>To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must -<blockquote>- have at least 520 paid contributions and<br \/><br \/>- satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages).<\/blockquote>Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.<br\/><br\/>In the case of mothers on maternity leave, credits are awarded to workers who go on maternity benefit.  Furthermore, the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated persons to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. <br\/><br\/>The State pension (contributory) is intended to reward those who have paid PRSI during their working lives, and\/or have remained engaged with the labour force when they were not in a position to make such paid contributions (e.g. due to unemployment or illness).  If a worker becomes unemployed or incapable of work, s\/he will generally be awarded credited contributions for the duration of their social welfare claim(s), or they may sign for jobseekers credits and these credited contributions are also used in the calculation of the yearly average for pension purposes.<br\/><br\/>If a person decides to retire at 53, and they do not qualify for a social protection payment nor sign for jobseekers credits, they may qualify for a lower rate of State pension (contributory) than a person who worked up to their 66<sup>th<\/sup>birthday.  Alternatively, they may qualify for the means-tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate of rate of which is &euro;219.<br\/><br\/>The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  As stated in reply to question no.54 of 10 December 2014, it is planned to replace this method of calculating pension entitlements with a &lsquo;total contribution approach&rsquo;.

To date, 208 samples have been referred by Revenue to the State Laboratory for analysis.  Despite extensive testing by the State Laboratory, no evidence of any prohibited stretching agent has been found in any of the samples, except two samples taken from one site.  The conclusive results received in that particular case has resulted in the seizure of the product and a file is being prepared for prosecution.<br\/><br\/>Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results indicated the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations.  This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time.  There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to deliberately mix normal road diesel with petrol.  This contamination could have taken place earlier in the summer, well ahead of the problems manifesting themselves in cars. <br\/><br\/>If the problems that have come to light were caused by an unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed into petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.However, the Deputy can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems.  In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.<br\/><br\/>I am also advised by Revenue that they undertake, on an on going basis, an extensive programme of compliance and enforcement actions to ensure adherence to the legal requirements governing the supply and sale of mineral oil and to allow action to be taken against fraud.  This involves, among other things, carrying out analysis of the monthly oil movement returns that oil traders are required to make, and of other supply chain data.  In addition, Revenue officers conduct control or compliance visits to mineral oil traders, during which they examine transport and movement documentation and take samples of fuel for analysis.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the Revenue Commissioners are working closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and share information and intelligence on this issue.

The Deputy should note that the figure for the net number of jobs is determined by the sum of the number of net full-time jobs and half of the number of part-time jobs for each year in question. <br\/><br\/><b>Table 1 : Enterprise Ireland<\/b><table><tr><th>Services<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Full-time Gains<\/td><td>3018<\/td><td>2716<\/td><td>2506<\/td><td>5094<\/td><td>4750<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Full-time Losses<\/td><td>4962<\/td><td>3297<\/td><td>2376<\/td><td>3035<\/td><td>2264<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net <\/td><td>-1944<\/td><td>-581<\/td><td>130<\/td><td>2059 <\/td><td>2486 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Manufacturing<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Full-time Gains<\/td><td>4425<\/td><td>5477<\/td><td>6570<\/td><td>7767<\/td><td>7782<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Full-time Losses<\/td><td>21559<\/td><td>10251<\/td><td>6694<\/td><td>6488<\/td><td>6648<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net <\/td><td>-17134<\/td><td>-4774<\/td><td>-124<\/td><td>1279<\/td><td>1134<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><b>Table 2 : LEOs\/CEBs <\/b><table><tr><th>Years <\/th><th>Full Time Gains<\/th><th>Full Time Losses<\/th><th>Other Time Gains<\/th><th>Other Time Losses<\/th><th>Net Full Time<\/th><th>Net Other Time<\/th><th>Net (Full Time + (Other Time\/2))<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>5278<\/td><td>-3967<\/td><td>3542<\/td><td>-3292<\/td><td>1311<\/td><td>250<\/td><td>1436<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>4858<\/td><td>-4602<\/td><td>3772<\/td><td>-3003<\/td><td>256<\/td><td>769<\/td><td>640.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>5331<\/td><td>-5901<\/td><td>3844<\/td><td>-3071<\/td><td>-570<\/td><td>773<\/td><td>-183.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>4510<\/td><td>-4958<\/td><td>2955<\/td><td>-2296<\/td><td>-448<\/td><td>659<\/td><td>-118.5<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":183,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":184,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[48696\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs lost and created through foreign direct investment in each of the past five years to date in 2014; the future expectations in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[48698\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which Ireland remains an attractive location for foreign direct investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[48701\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which other European locations have been noted as serious competitors for foreign direct investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 72 and 75 together.  <br\/><br\/>The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment survey reports on the job gains and losses in companies supported by the industrial development agencies.  Data is gathered on an annualised basis and is aggregated at county level.  Data for 2014 will not be available until early in 2015.  Details of the number of jobs gained and lost in companies that are supported by IDA Ireland are set out in the following tabular statement.<br\/><br\/>Attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Ireland has been one of the key pillars of Ireland&rsquo;s industrial policy over the last 40 years.  That policy has proved to be particularly successful as, at the end of 2013 there were 161,112 people employed in IDA client companies.  At the beginning of January 2014 IDA Ireland assumed responsibility for companies that had been clients of Shannon Development thereby increasing the number of people employed in IDA Ireland client companies to in excess of 166,000.<br\/><br\/>Ireland continues to compete very well in the international marketplace for investment.  For example over 100 investments were secured by IDA Ireland in the first six months of 2014, compared to 70 at the same time in 2013.  Of the investments secured, 40% came from companies investing in Ireland for the first time.  Projects approved during the first half of 2014 will lead to the creation of 8,000 jobs during 2014 and over future years as the companies roll out their investment plans.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is very much the number one location of choice of companies that want to internationalise.  US corporations are choosing Ireland as the location of choice for their global operations. Ireland is now a strong exporting nation, with particularly strong performances in sectors such as ICT, Med Tech and Pharma. <br\/><br\/>In recent days IBM&rsquo;s key Global Locations Report described Ireland as the ``top performer in the world&rsquo;&rsquo; in terms of the quality of the investments that are attracted here.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is a location which large multinationals know and trust.  They have been coming to Ireland for decades, for our talent pool, competitive tax offering, technology infrastructure and track record.  Forbes magazine named Ireland as the best country in the world to do business in December 2013. <br\/><br\/>Within Europe, Ireland&rsquo;s FDI performance positions us in absolute terms inside the top ten European locations for investment projects, with the UK, Germany and France the top locations.  The range of countries competing for FDI in Europe demonstrates the intensity of the marketplace to secure investments for Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The economics of the past 5 years has changed Europe&rsquo;s FDI landscape.  Over the period, the UK, Germany, Netherlands and Belgium have maintained investor confidence, confirming their position as safe havens for FDI, with low risk and sustainable profitability.  Ireland successfully adapted to the demands of the international economy and cost competitiveness, talent availability and targeted sectoral focus were underpinned by the strong economic management and certainty on the 12.5% corporate tax rate.<br\/><br\/>The United States continues to be the largest single investor in Europe accounting for about 25% of all inward investment projects and job creation.  While Ireland is a very significant recipient of US FDI, the competition is intense with the UK, Germany and France the major overall beneficiaries of US investment into Europe. <br\/><br\/>That having been said, IDA Ireland recognises the challenges for Ireland and its regions in attracting FDI and, with this in mind, a new IDA Ireland strategy will be launched early in the New Year, detailing goals and the broad direction IDA Ireland will take to accomplish them over the next five years.<br\/><br\/><b>Table showing the number of jobs gained and lost in IDA Ireland client companies in each of the 5 years, 2009 to 2013 inclusive<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>No of Companies <\/td><td>1,087<\/td><td>1,083<\/td><td>1,088<\/td><td>1,127<\/td><td>1,153<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Jobs<\/td><td>144,843<\/td><td>146,419<\/td><td>152,176<\/td><td>159,144<\/td><td>166,184<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>New Jobs Created (Gross Gains)<\/td><td>6,322<\/td><td>14,279<\/td><td>14,494<\/td><td>15,209<\/td><td>13,552<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gross Losses<\/td><td>-21,316<\/td><td>-12,703<\/td><td>-8,737<\/td><td>-8,241<\/td><td>-6,512<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net Change<\/td><td>-14,994<\/td><td>1,576<\/td><td>5,757<\/td><td>6,968<\/td><td>7,040<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cost Competitiveness","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01550"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[48699\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he continues to monitor the cost base for Irish industry with particular reference to comparison with other adjoining and EU jurisdictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>Cost competitiveness is an important aspect of Ireland's overall competitiveness.  Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years.<\/p><p>  The real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator (HCI) is a measure of the trade-weighted exchange rate for Ireland, adjusted for relative price developments. In October 2014, Ireland's real HCI fell by 3.9 per cent year on year.  A fall indicates an improvement in price competitiveness and leaves Irish-based firms better equipped to compete on the international market.  Relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to our euro area peers.<\/p><p>  There has been a significant improvement in economy-wide cost competitiveness.  The European Commission in its autumn forecasts estimate that real unit labour costs in Ireland will fall by 4.3 per cent annually in 2014 which is the largest decline across all EU Member States and compares with a fall of 1.2 per cent in the UK, and increases of 0.1 per cent in the EU, 0.2 per cent in the US and 0.3 per cent in the euro over the same time period.  Competitiveness has been achieved through wage moderation vis-a-vis trading partners as well as productivity improvements. <\/p><p>  We continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis.  This is specifically required under the Action Plan for Jobs 2014. Action 94 requires the National Competitiveness Council to &ldquo;Benchmark key business costs and publish a report highlighting areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors&rdquo;.<\/p><p>  The report concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, energy, water, waste, communications and business services.  The NCC note that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last four or five years.  This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in.  However, despite these improvements, the NCC note that it is essential that we continue to focus on reducing costs that comprise a significant percentage of business costs and that are out of line with those in competitor countries. <\/p><p>  Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness, therefore, remains a key economic priority for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Research and Development Supports","counter":191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01750"},{"type":"question","counter":192,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[48700\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700087#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which smaller indigenous companies may avail of assistance by way of support for research and innovation with consequent improved job retention and creation prospects; the extent to which he sees such smaller companies being in a position to avail of such assistance in the current and following years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":193,"content":"<p>Investment in Research, Development and Innovation (RD&amp;amp;I) is a key economic differentiator which can support Irish companies of all scales to adapt to, and excel in a global market which in turn leads to increased exports and jobs.  As a result the Government considers that it is critical that Irish companies are supported to engage in RD&amp;amp;I.  National statistics show that companies engaged in RD&amp;amp;I are gaining an increasing share of sales, export sales and are accounting for increasing shares of employment.  RDI performing firms have also demonstrated better employment retention during recent years.  Exports from R&amp;amp;D performing companies increased significantly during the 10 years to end 2013 while over the same period exports for non R&amp;amp;D performing companies decreased significantly. <br\/><br\/>Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a spectrum of science, technology and RD&amp;amp;I development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support to help companies become more innovative, encourage and support competitiveness, and help them grow their sales and exports in order to create a climate in which sustainable employment will grow and expand. <br\/><br\/>Enterprise Ireland will support over 1,000 companies to engage in R&amp;amp;D in 2015. These supports will include in-company R&amp;amp;D projects via the R&amp;amp;D Fund, small to medium sized collaborative projects with researchers in higher level institutions under the Innovation Voucher and Innovation Partnership programmes and large consortium-based research via sector specific Technology Centres. <br\/><br\/>Evidence from the evaluation of the range of Enterprise Ireland RDI programmes shows the direct return on this investment by way of impact on turnover. For example, companies supported by Enterprise Ireland to engage in collaborative R&amp;amp;D via the Innovation Partnership scheme created &euro;6.69 in company turnover for every &euro;1 Enterprise Ireland invested in the scheme which illustrates the considerable growth potential of engaging in this economically advantageous activity. <br\/><br\/>Aligned with this suite of supports, which are suitable for and available to companies based in Ireland of all sizes and stages of development, is a strong promotional strategy which seeks to inform companies of these incentives while also encouraging them to apply and reap the economic benefits from this economically advantageous activity.<br\/><br\/>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s promotional approach seeks to have as broad a reach as possible. It ranges from &ldquo;one to one&rdquo; promotion between Enterprise Ireland client companies and their Development Advisors, to larger &ldquo;one to many&rdquo; promotional activities that include web based notifications, social media activity, national media and specific Enterprise Ireland events. <br\/><br\/>One such event, coordinated by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of my Department, was the National Innovation for Industry Showcase held on 2 December 2014 in the National Conference Centre which was the first convention, in one location, of all the Irish State-supported large scale research centres, technology centres and national research institutes and facilities.  The event introduced industry of all sizes to the excellent scientific research and disruptive technologies being developed in these centres and institutes and which are delivering solutions for industry in key areas including energy, food, health and medical technologies, ICT, manufacturing and services. It also provided an excellent opportunity for these centres to engage with companies as potential collaborators and to raise the awareness of the range of complementary RD&amp;amp;I supports available to companies in Ireland. <br\/><br\/><font color=\"#212100\">  Continued and intensified promotion such as this will continue during 2015 to ensure that as many SMEs as possible avail of the RD&amp;amp;I supports available to gain competitive advantage.  <\/font>Within the constraints of our economic circumstances, the Government for its part is continuing to prioritise the funding available for research, development and innovation and critically, maximising the impact of this investment on jobs and the economy.  <br\/><br\/>Finally, the Government also has in place the R&amp;amp;D Tax Credit.  This relief provides a 25% tax credit for qualifying Research and Development expenditure for companies engaged in in-house qualifying research and development.

As the Deputy will appreciate, questions of price are ultimately matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle. Cattle prices are determined by supply \/ demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by the seasonality of production, the length of the production lifecycle and market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats and the overall macro-economic situation.  It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU, to intervene directly on these issues. The State, through the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, already has a well established infrastructure for dealing with allegations of anti competitive practices and I do not consider it appropriate to replicate that structure by establishing a beef regulator. Of course, if the Deputy is in possess ion of any information regarding uncompetitive practices in the beef sector, I would encourage him to bring this to the attention of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.<\/p><p>  I also believe it is important that the sector operates in a transparent manner and there is a wealth of information available to farmers under the Beef Pricewatch section on my Department&rsquo;s website, including the prices for Steers, Cows, and Heifers across the classification grid, for each DAFM approved factory. Improved transparency has also been delivered through the introduction of a Beef Pricewatch App which was developed by my Department. The App presents a range of up to date price information in a user-friendly fashion and is available free of charge to farmers and others interested in this information. The feedback from the users to date has been extremely positive and my Department is already looking at adding new features. <\/p><p>  As regards current price levels, it should be noted that prices for R3 steers in Ireland have risen by 26 cents per kilo since the beginning of September.

I should also note recent agreement on a number of outcomes through the Beef RoundTable process. This agreement addresses a range of the issues raised by farmers in recent months, particularly as regards market signals and product specifications.

As Minister for Agriculture, I have recently witnessed first-hand the potential of the Chinese market in particular. Ireland&rsquo;s dairy offering resonates with Chinese and other third-market consumers who place safety, traceability and sustainability at the core of their value proposition.

Many children live in families other than with their married biological parents, and up to now there has been very little legal recognition or protection for children living in these families.<\/p><p>  The Children and Family Relationships Bill is a child-centred Bill which will have a real and meaningful effect on the lives of many children, especially those born through donor-conception, whether they are born to opposite-sex or same-sex couples. Under the law as it stands, parentage cannot be secured by a same-sex couple.  As a result, the non-biological parent does not have the rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child. Opposite-sex couples can benefit from presumptions of paternity in relation to the intending father, but this is rebuttable, which means that the child remains in a vulnerable position as regards his or her parentage.<\/p><p>  The Bill will change this situation. The measures in the Bill will ensure that a donor-conceived child born to a couple has rights in relation to both of his or her parents, and that both parents have corresponding rights and responsibilities to the child. The rights of the child to know his or her identity, including as to his or her genetic origins, are also secured. A key aim of the Bill is to secure the child's best interests and to ensure that they and their families have legal recognition and protection.<\/p><p>  The General Scheme also includes a number of provisions aimed at supporting the relationship between parents and children.  Many unmarried fathers will benefit from the provisions, for example, enabling them to become guardians of their children automatically if they have lived with the child's mother for 12 months, including 3 months following the child's birth.  The provisions on making parenting orders work recognise the importance of supporting parents to maintain meaningful relationships with their children even in the context of relationship breakdown between the adults.  To this end, the General Scheme proposes a series of measures to ensure better compliance by both parents with custody and access orders.<\/p><p>  In light of these points, I would not, therefore, accept any of the propositions behind the concerns set out in the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700092#WRM01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Sales Legislation","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700092#WRM01100"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[48496\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700092#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the consultation process will begin for the draft statutory code of practice relating to the sale and display of alcohol in mixed trading premises; if she will provide an update on plans for the structured separation of alcohol from other products in such premises; and if the draft code will include measures to separate alcohol in this regard.","asker":"1023","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[48497\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700092#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the new statutory code of practice relating to the sale and display of alcohol in mixed trading premises will include measures to restrict the advertising of bulk alcohol offers and below cost alcohol in large quantities.","asker":"1023","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.<\/p><p>  The position is that my Department is currently finalising the content of the draft statutory Code of Practice on the display and sale of alcohol products in mixed trading outlets. I hope to be in a position to launch the consultation process on the contents of the Code, as required under section 17 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, in the coming weeks. It is intended that the statutory code will operate for a two year period, after which its effectiveness will be jointly evaluated by my Department and the Department of Health. The results of this joint evaluation will inform any future decision on implementing the statutory provisions on structural separation which are set out in section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008. <\/p><p>  With regard to volume-based alcohol promotions, the position is that section 16 of the 2008 Act contains separate provisions for the making of regulations concerning the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol products. From the outset it was recognised, however, that a joint  North\/South approach to restricting alcohol promotions would be desirable; otherwise, the effectiveness of any measures introduced in this jurisdiction could be undermined by means of increased cross-Border shopping if similar measures were not introduced in Northern Ireland. During discussions in early 2012 between my predecessor and the Minister for Social Development in Northern Ireland, the desirability of implementing a joint North\/South approach to restricting certain 'volume-based' alcohol promotions was agreed.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Development in Northern Ireland subsequently launched a consultation process on draft proposals to restrict bulk purchases of alcohol products in supermarkets and other premises with off-licences. Arising from this consultation process, and following the expression of concerns by the Assembly's Social Development Committee, the Minister announced that he had decided not to proceed with restrictions on bulk purchases from off-licences.     <\/p><p>  As regards future action, the position is that the Government has agreed that the forthcoming Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will give Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) statutory enforcement powers in relation to regulations made under section 16 of the 2008 Act. Following enactment of this legislation, I will consider how best to proceed with the making of such regulations. In this context, I remain conscious that the effectiveness of any future restrictions on volume-based promotions in this jurisdiction could be undermined by the lack of corresponding measures in Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>  In so far as 'below cost' selling is concerned, the position is that the Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse in response to the Report of the Steering Group on a National Substance Misuse Strategy, including minimum unit pricing measures which will be included in the forthcoming Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700092#WRM01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700092#WRM01500"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[48505\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700092#WRM01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of life sentence prisoners released from prison in 2013; the average length of time served by these life sentence prisoners prior to release in 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that a total of four life sentenced prisoners were released into the community  in 2013.

The period of release is reviewed when the prisoner returns to prison and a decision is made whether to refuse or grant a further period of reviewable temporary release.<\/p><p>  The Probation Service provide progress reports to the Irish Prison Service outlining resettlement and reintegration progress and will report on any risk management concerns a Life Sentenced prisoner may present.

The initial focus of the newly established Authority is on the development of a Register of Charities, upon which all charities operating in this country will be obliged to register. Part 4 of the Charities Act, which provides for the investigatory functions of the Authority, has not yet been commenced. The Register, when it is more advanced, will in time be the foundation which underpins the investigative and other regulatory work of the Authority.  I can confirm that the website of the Charities Regulatory Authority, www.charitiesregulatoryauthority.ie, went live on 16 October 2014, the date of the establishment of the Authority.<\/p><p>  The development of the Register of Charities is the initial task of the Authority. To date, it has written to some 4,500 charities with charitable tax exemptions seeking the extensive information on their finances and structure required to underpin the regulation of the sector. It is envisaged that all 8,500 charities that had charitable tax exemptions on the day of the establishment of the Authority will be contacted in this way by early in the New Year. The Register is also open to applications for charitable status from those charities that are not in receipt of charitable tax exemptions.<\/p><p>  It is not possible to give a definite timeframe for completion of the Register at this early stage in the life of the Authority, as the work involved in its development is, to a large extent, dependent on the charities themselves. I am assured, however, that the Authority will continue to pursue this goal with all possible speed.  My Department conducted a wide ranging consultation with the charities sector and other stakeholders on the matter of  fees and other issues in 2013. It is intended that in time, all charities will be charged fees; these fees will vary depending on the income of the charity. It is envisaged that an announcement on the appropriate levels of fees for registration and annual reporting, which will go towards assisting with the cost of regulation, will be made in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700093#WRN00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cyber Bullying Issues","counter":333,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700093#WRN00650"},{"type":"question","counter":334,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[48597\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700093#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the measures that have been taken in the past year to deal with\u00a0cyberbullying; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":335,"content":"<p>The Office for Internet Safety (OIS) is an Executive Office within my Department.

Incentivised Regimes provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.<br\/><br\/>There are three levels of privilege - basic, standard and enhanced and each prison has developed an information booklet on how the scheme operates and specifically on the criteria and privileges associated with each level of regime.  Prisoners on the enhanced regime level are significantly more likely to benefit from temporary release programmes such as Community Return &ndash; where prisoners are released early under Probation Supervision to partake of voluntary work for the benefit of the community &ndash; and\/or transfer to an open centre. These are significant motivational factors in encouraging prisoners to engage in authorised structured activities and improve general behaviour. The hope is that these benefits are not just apparent in prisons and that the behavioural change effected will stay with the prisoner on his release. Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that an incentivised regime structure is a hugely valuable addition to prisons in the context of good order and prisoner compliance.<br\/><br\/>The standard set of core privileges provided in each prison comprises of different levels of daily gratuity ranging from &euro;0.95 to &euro;2.20, the number and length of visits a prisoner is allowed to receive and the number of telephone calls a prisoner is allowed to make. Each prison has drawn up a list of privileges available under each regime level. The list of available privileges is likely to vary between prisons and within different areas of a prison, depending on the operational and infrastructure requirements of each prison. Examples of other incentives offered include improved accommodation ( e.g. move from dormitory accommodation to a single room in an open centre).  In the past, access to facilities such as DVD players, games consoles have been provided.  Prisoners can also gain access to employment opportunities within the prison e.g. kitchens, laundries etc.<br\/><br\/>Specifically in relation to Portlaoise Prison E Block, the introduction of the Incentivised Regimes policy within the prison system had to take cognisance of existing practices and procedures in prisons. This was to ensure that prisoners were not disadvantaged or suffered a deterioration in their regime due to the introduction of this new policy. Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that an incentivised regime structure is a hugely valuable addition in prisons in the context of good order and prisoner compliance. As such, prisoner buy-in is an essential component for the success of the initiative.<br\/><br\/>I can advise the Deputy that the Governor of Portlaoise prison and his management team make decisions on the regime level for prisoners on the E Block<font color=\"#004080\">. <\/font>On 16 December of the 11 prisoners on the E2 landing 9 were on the enhanced regime and 2 were on the standard.  While all prisoners serving a sentence, (excluding those serving a life sentence; those serving a sentence for the non payment of a court ordered debt and those serving sentences for contempt of court),  may apply for one third remission, applications are considered by reference to a number of other factors including behaviour and conduct while incarcerated, the nature of the offence, the level and nature of the prisoner's engagement in authorised structured activities and the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700093#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Releases","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700094#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[48706\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700094#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the decision-making process she relied upon to reach her decision to deny one third remission in respect of a person (details supplied); if the incentivised regimes status and reports factored in reaching her decision in these matters, or if it was a political decision.","asker":"1192","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the application by the prisoner (details supplied) for enhanced remission was considered under Rule 59 (2) of SI 252 of 2007 (the Prison Rules).

Prior to the introduction of the programme in January 2010 there was no requirement for staff working directly with children in pre-school services to hold any education qualification.<br\/><br\/>It is a requirement of the ECCE programme that pre-school year leaders<b><\/b>in services participating in the programme, and who are receiving the standard capitation,  hold a qualification in childcare which is equivalent to Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications of Ireland (NFQ). A higher capitation rate is available to services participating in the ECCE programme in which all of the pre-school leaders hold  an appropriate qualification at a minimum of Level 7 and pre-school assistants hold a Level 5 on the NFQ.  <br\/><br\/>As part of the Early Years Quality Agenda, new qualification requirements for childcare workers are being introduced.  All staff caring for children in an early years service will be subject to a minimum qualification requirement of Level 5, while pre-school leaders delivering the ECCE programme will require a Level 6 qualification.  It is expected that these requirements will come into effect from September 2015 for existing services. <br\/><br\/>Pobal, which administers the childcare support programmes on behalf of my Department, compiles an Annual Survey of the Early Years Sector.  According to its 2013 Annual Survey, of the childcare services that responded to the question relating to the number of staff employed, 87% of staff have a qualification equal to or higher than Level 5 on the NFQ.<br\/><br\/>This figure confirms the finding of previous annual surveys conducted by Pobal. Further figures provided in the Pobal Survey indicate that the number of childcare workers holding a Level 6 qualification is in the region of 45%. <br\/><br\/>Figures compiled this year by my Department indicate that approximately 24% of the 4,200 services participating in the ECCE programme are in receipt of the higher capitation. This means that at least one member of staff in the qualifying childcare service holds an appropriate qualification at Level 7 or higher.<br\/><br\/>It is estimated by Pobal, from information provided by respondents to their Annual Survey 2013 that there are in the region of 24,000 staff employed in the childcare sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700095#WRP00600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Education and Training Scheme Places","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700095#WRP00650"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[48679\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700095#WRP00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of children with special educational needs participating in the early childhood care and education scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":380,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children before they commence primary school.

Every person who uses disability services is entitled to expect and receive supports of the highest standard and to live in an atmosphere of safety and care.  This is particularly important for vulnerable people in residential care whose families have entrusted them to the care of professional staff. <br\/><br\/>The allegations of mistreatment in the Prime Time programme are very disturbing and need to be fully investigated.  In that regard, I welcome the immediate response of the HSE, following receipt of these serious allegations, to alert the Garda&iacute; and HIQA and for the protection of both residents and staff themselves, to put a number of staff 'off-duty' while the allegations are being investigated.  I am assured that staffing levels are being appropriately maintained to deliver safe care to all residents. <br\/><br\/>I also welcome and support the HSE's initiation of both an expert investigation into these serious allegations chaired by Mr Christy Lynch and an independently chaired review of the services provided at this facility, led by Dr Kevin McCoy. <br\/><br\/>Mr. Lynch's investigation will examine in particular the practices, behaviours and attitudes of the staff of Unit 3 and will form an important input into the disciplinary process which must be undertaken by the HSE.<br\/><br\/>Dr. McCoy's review will focus on assuring the quality and safety of care of residents in &Aacute;ras Attracta.  This will be informed by earlier work done by both the HSE and HIQA and will seek to identify any gaps and any contributory and\/or causal factors.  It will make recommendations so as to eliminate, in any way it is possible to do so, any risk of harm occurring in the future. <br\/><br\/>I understand that the Director General of the HSE has written to all staff informing them that the onus is on them to take personal responsibility to ensure that the individuals supported by the HSE in any setting are treated with dignity and respect. <br\/><br\/>The HSE's new National Policy and Procedures for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse, which I launched with the HSE on 5th December 2014, clears the way for staff members in HSE and non-HSE facilities, and members of the public, to refer allegations of abuse to designated reporting individuals. <br\/><br\/>This new policy places an onus on providers of services to vulnerable people to appoint a Designated Officer to both receive and follow up on concerns and reports of abuse.  Under the new policy it is the responsibility of all staff and service providers to ensure the protection and welfare of vulnerable people.  In each Community Healthcare Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work in partnership with all relevant service providers to ensure that concerns and complaints are addressed. <br\/><br\/>This policy complements the statutory inspection by HIQA of nursing homes and residential centres  for people with a disability and is very welcome.  I also welcome the public appeal made by the Chief Executive of HIQA to encourage any persons who have concerns about the treatment of vulnerable persons in our disability services to contact HIQA.  He has emphasised that the matter will be taken very seriously and looked at in the context of HIQA's very significant regulatory powers of inspection of residential facilities. <br\/><br\/>A system wide process is now commencing, with the establishment of a National Implementation Taskforce.  A 6 step programme will be implemented and monitored and will focus on: <br\/><br\/>- Implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse  - National  Policy &amp;amp; Procedures <br\/><br\/>- Advocacy <br\/><br\/>- Evaluation and Practice Improvement<br\/><br\/>- National Summit (Tuesday 16 December) - to improve Client Safety, Dignity, Respect &amp;amp; Culture Change<br\/><br\/>- Implementation plan for any recommendations arising from the assurance review of residential services in Aras Attracta when complete<br\/><br\/>- Development of long term sustainable &amp;amp; evidence based safeguarding practices and training programmes specific to residential settings<br\/><br\/>- Implementation of Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse  - NationalPolicy &amp;amp; Procedures <br\/><br\/>I have been fully briefed by the HSE since they became aware of these allegations and I have asked it to ensure that all appropriate resources are put in place to ensure that the safety and care of residents at &Aacute;ras Attracta is maintained at the highest possible standard.  I have also asked the HSE to brief me on the outcome of these investigations as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>It is not appropriate for me to comment or prejudge the outcome of these investigations in advance of their completion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700097#WRR00900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Administration","counter":422,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700097#WRR01000"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[48555\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700097#WRR01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"why a child (details supplied) in County Cork has only been seen once this year by an endocrinologist when regular scheduled appointments are required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"996","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":424,"content":"<p>The scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the hospital to which the patient has been referred.

These measures are based on the recommendations contained in the <i>Steering Group Report on a National Substance Misuse Strategy<\/i>, 2012.  The package of measures to be implemented will include provision for minimum unit pricing, regulation of the marketing and advertising of alcohol, regulation of sports sponsorship, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products.  <br\/><br\/>The key measure is the drafting of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which will include provisions for minimum unit pricing, restrictions on marketing and advertising, structural separation of alcohol from other products in mixed trading outlets and labelling of alcohol products, among other measures.  Minimum unit pricing is a key part of our strategy to deal with alcohol misuse.  It is, I believe, the one measure that will make the most difference most quickly.  Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum unit price for alcoholic drinks below which alcohol cannot be sold.  Under MUP, alcohol which is cheap relative to its strength is increased in price.  MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.  There is strong and clear scientific evidence that an increase in alcohol prices reduces hazardous drinking and serious alcohol related problems.  My Department, in conjunction with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, commissioned a health impact assessment from Sheffield University as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing.  The research studied the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and the economy.  The report's findings are under consideration.  Officials in my Department are liaising with their Northern Irish counterparts on the introduction of minimum unit pricing.  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and it is intended to publish a General Scheme of a Bill in January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700097#WRR02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":434,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700097#WRR02200"},{"type":"question","counter":435,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[48599\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700097#WRR02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his Department and the Health Service Executive's policy in respect of the provision of\u00a0epi-pens; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[48600\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700097#WRR02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children who are in receipt of\u00a0epi-pens; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1004","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":437,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[48601\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700097#WRR02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on introducing a scheme to make\u00a0epi-pens available in schools, workplaces and other public places, similar to the provision of defibrillators; and if he will introduce a scheme to train volunteers as first responders.","asker":"1004","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":438,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 to 165, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  Under the current legislation, epi-pens (adrenaline auto-injectors), as injectable medicines, may only be supplied on foot of a valid prescription.

This is based on assessment of a transcript of the applicant&rsquo;s education programme(s), a detailed curriculum vitae, a professional reference and verification of the applicant&rsquo;s registration status and good standing from any regulatory authority where the applicant has worked.  The applicant&rsquo;s education programme is assessed to see how it compares with the requirements and standards of NMBI for nurse\/midwifery registration education programmes.  The NMBI requirements are based on European Union Directive 2005\/36\/EC which clearly sets out the theoretical and clinical practice requirements for nurse registration education programmes throughout the EU.  These have been in place for general nursing since 1977 and 1980 for midwifery and must be adhered to by all Member States of the EU.  Taken into account in assessing an education programme are the specific subjects and quantity of the theoretical instruction and the variety and quantity of the clinical practice experience during the programme.  If an individual&rsquo;s initial nursing education programme does not meet the requirements then any post-registration nursing education and supervised clinical practice can be taken into account.  The outcome of an application will be one of the following: if the requirements are met in full, then Direct Registration will be granted; if the requirements are not met in full but, taking into account all education and supervised clinical practice experience, are not significantly below the requirements then the applicant will be required to successfully undertake a period of adaptation and assessment in an approved site prior to registration with NMBI; if the applicants education programme is so significantly below the requirements for registration such that post-registration education and supervised clinical practice cannot compensate for the deficits within their programme, then registration will be refused; an internal appeals mechanism is in place for those applicants who have either been refused registration, been issued with an adaptation and assessment decision or who fail an adaptation placement.<br\/><br\/>Nursing\/midwifery education programmes in Australia  are not uniform in duration or content.  The theoretical and clinical content of these  programmes varies significantly.  Some education programmes are such that registration is refused or an adaptation and assessment decision is reached.  In other instances registration is granted.It is important again to note that each application is assessed and evaluated on an individual basis.  <br\/><br\/>The central tenet of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) is the protection of the public and as such NMBI must be fully satisfied that each application that is considered for registration is fully reviewed and decisions reached are in full compliance with requirements and standards for registration.  Individuals who have queries regarding the application process or outcome of an individual assessment should contact NMBI directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700098#WRS00900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700098#WRS00950"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[48637\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700098#WRS01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps the will take to have a general practitioner visit card issued by the Health Service Executive in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath who has supplied the requested information; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. Gross  income, in respect of the over 70's medical card scheme refers to total basic income prior to any or all deductions being made. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole. There are no proposals to change this assessment process and it is not seen to constitute discrimination under equality legislation.<\/p><p>  In the main, persons in the over-70s age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis. The assessment of eligibility under the standard  means tested medical card scheme is based on the combined income of the applicant and spouse or partner (if any) after tax, PRSI and USC have been deducted . Allowance may be made for rent\/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  Generally, for the over 70s, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel to work related costs. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card where discretion is exercised where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700098#WRS01500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointment Status","counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700099#WRT00150"},{"type":"question","counter":463,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[48643\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700099#WRT00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a hospital appointment and operation in respect of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":464,"content":"<p>The scheduling of appointments for patients is a matter for the hospital to which the patient has been referred.

The review was commissioned by the Secretary General of the Department of Health. Its overall intention was to review the state of the financial management system in place in the health sector in Ireland at the time in the context of the serious overruns projected to occur in 2012, the continuation of a challenging financial environment for the foreseeable future and the radical reforms envisioned in the Programme for Government.<br\/><br\/>The report made a number of recommendations to improve the financial management process within the HSE, with particular reference to managing the transition phase that the health sector was undergoing. The recommendations were grouped into 3 distinct areas: Improving Financial Performance; Policy Considerations; and Effective Transitioning (Managing the Change).  These are set out in the following table.<br\/><br\/>As part of the process of further strengthening the financial management of the HSE, additional independent expertise was engaged to evaluate the financial performance management system and a Finance Reform Board has been established comprising the HSE Director General (Chair), senior HSE management and representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<br\/><br\/>The HSE commenced the Finance Reform Programme in Autumn 2012. One of the main outputs of Phase 1 of the programme was the development of a new finance operating model in health which was contained in the document entitled <i>Defining Financial Management: A Finance Operating Model for Health in Ireland,<\/i>available on the HSE website.<i><\/i>This report encompasses a roadmap for the finance function to facilitate delivery of an efficient and effective financial service to meet the emerging requirements of the changing organisational face of the health system.<br\/><br\/>A critical enabler for the transformation of financial management is the introduction of a single Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) which is considered to be the single most important non-clinical priority for the HSE this year. The initial key element of Phase 2 of the Finance Reform Programme was the preparation of a detailed business case for a new operating model in relation to securing the necessary approval to procure a new IFMS for the health service. The Business Case defines the case for change and scope as well as providing an estimate of the resources required to deliver the operating model and supporting technology. The HSE has submitted a business case to my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is receiving attention.<br\/><br\/>Phase 3 of the Finance Reform Programme is now progressing on a number of key workstreams. HSE has begun an industry engagement exercise on the Financial Operating Model and the strategic procurement approach it will be taking with suppliers.

The Council welcomed the broadly encouraging prospects while recognising that challenges remain.  The recent announcement by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer on Corporation Tax was also discussed. Both administrations reflected on their respective successes in attracting external investment while acknowledging that there is a key role to be played by indigenous companies in economic development.  The opportunities to work together on Joint Trade Missions and on developing new markets were also recognised.<\/p><p>  The Council noted that, following Ministerial consideration of a report on the feasibility of submitting a joint bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023, it had been agreed to support the IRFU&rsquo;s bid, and indeed the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, First Minister, deputy First Minister and other Ministers had attended the launch of the bid in Armagh just before the Plenary meeting.   The Council discussed the potential benefits hosting such an event would bring to both jurisdictions and agreed that the relevant Ministers should work closely together to ensure the strongest possible bid is submitted.<\/p><p>  Ministers noted that the new draft PEACE and INTERREG Programmes are currently with the European Commission for consideration and it is hoped that the final Programmes will be launched in Spring 2015.<\/p><p>  The Council welcomed the ongoing discussions between Ministers at NSMC meetings on the potential for collaboration to draw down EU funds and noted that there is active engagement between both jurisdictions on the opportunities available.  The Council looked forward to a further progress report at its next meeting.<\/p><p>  Ministers also noted the position on Sectoral Priorities and the North West Gateway Initiative and agreed to keep these matters on its agenda.  They also discussed the Progress Report prepared by the NSMC Joint Secretaries on the work of the North South Bodies and in the other NSMC areas for co-operation and noted the current position on a North South Consultative Forum.<\/p><p>  There was an in-depth discussion on Child Protection issues with a particular focus on e-Safety, and the good collaborative work already taking place, both within the NSMC structures and elsewhere was noted.  Ministers recognised that issues such as these are cross-cutting and cross-jurisdictional and will require an ongoing collaborative approach between both administrations.  The Council agreed that Ministers who have a remit in Child Protection and E-Safety related activities should engage with their counterparts in the opposite jurisdiction to explore whether there is potential for further collaboration.  It was also agreed that this topic should be revisited at a future meeting.<\/p><p>  The next plenary meeting of the NSMC is scheduled to take place in early summer 2015, and I am looking forward to continuing to work closely and constructively on all of these issues with our Northern colleagues in the North South Ministerial Council.<\/p><p>  Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement provided for the establishment of the North\/South Ministerial Council and the North\/South Implementation Bodies.

The Irish Government has strongly advocated progress on these matters in the current talks.

In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. My Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools (23:1 in fee-charging schools).<\/p><p>  Guidance and counselling are a whole-school responsibility, with guidance counsellors playing their part within an overall team approach. The representative organisations for school principals and school management have developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation.

These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyberbullying, are addressed.<\/p><p>  As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, new National Anti-Bullying Procedures for schools, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published in September 2013 and are currently being implemented by all 4,000 primary and post primary schools in the country. Training materials for parents, teachers and Boards of Management are also being developed and rolled out.<\/p><p>  The recommended approach is for schools to aim to prevent bullying in schools and, where it does happen, to take the steps required to address the issue at local level. There is no obligation on school authorities to report incidents of bullying to my Department and my Department does not collate data on individual bullying incidents.<\/p><p>  My Department supports Safer Internet Day, an initiative that addresses internet safety issues, including cyber-bullying, for young people.  In addition awareness-raising initiatives on cyberbullying including &quot;Up2Us&quot;, a new resource to tackle cyberbullying, are provided through the internet safety initiative, Webwise.  An Up2Us Social Media Roadshow to help teenagers adopt best practice in terms of social media engagement was run in collaboration with Beat 102-103 over a 5 week period from mid-October 2014.<\/p><p>  A study on &quot;The Prevalence and Impact of Bullying Linked to Social Media on the Mental Health and Suicidal Behaviour among Young People&quot;, which was commissioned by my Department and the National Office for Suicide Prevention, was published in May 2014. The review notes that as cyberbullying appears to be closely tied to traditional bullying, it is likely that already established anti-bullying interventions will also impact on cyberbullying and that entirely new programmes are not necessary.<\/p><p>  Central to promoting safer use of the Internet by young people is a strong commitment to changing behaviour and raising the knowledge, skills and attitudes around preventing, responding to and reporting cyberbullying incidents. The continued implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying will increase capacity in these areas and build on my Department's current strategy to ensure that internet safety is mainstreamed throughout schools' teaching, learning and other practices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700104#WRY00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700104#WRY00450"},{"type":"question","counter":582,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[48609\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014121700104#WRY00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the Education Admission\u00a0to School\u00a0Bill will\u00a0be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In addition to those actions which constitute an immediate response to the is sue of rough sleeping in Dublin, actions have been identified which tackle the more systemic issues, classified under the three categories of the &lsquo;housing-led&rsquo;a pproach.A copy of th is action plan is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at  .In addition, all housing authorities will return void properties to productive use as a matter of urgencyunder the action plan. <br\/><br\/>Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.
