I ask the Leader to provide time in the new year for a debate on the undocumented living in Ireland and the earned regularisation scheme.

Thankfully, Senator Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill is present and I can address directly his comments on stopping Irish overseas aid to Third World countries.  In the week approaching Christmas it is very dangerous to be discussing putting a stop to aid to such countries as a result of the fact that we are borrowing the money involved.  We are obliged to borrow that money and the reason we are giving some of it to the countries to which I refer is we are in a position to borrow it on the markets.  I would not reduce our overseas aid by even 1 cent.  The \u20ac100 we borrow from the European Central Bank or some other institution has a great deal more value in a village in Kenya in which there might be no infrastructure or water.  I am sure Senator Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill will reflect on what he said on this matter.  The debate in this regard was begun by a certain celebrity solicitor in Dublin who stated, first, that he would not pay his property tax as a matter of principle and, second, that we should not be sending money to Third World countries when we were obliged to borrow it for ourselves.

Most of the &#8364;623 million that will be borrowed to provide such aid next year and for which taxpayers will be liable will be paid to the United Nations, the European Union, world banks and regional banks in Africa.  Ireland is sending &#8364;43 million to a country which purchased fighter jets.  An article appeared in yesterday's edition of <i>The Guardian<\/i> in which it was stated corruption had resulted in &#8364;5 billion in aid being withdrawn from an African country to which the Government proposes to give &#8364;30 million next year.  Countries in Africa must be helped in order that they might help themselves.  The aid we are providing is not being used appropriately in order to assist people to help themselves.  Why not just keep the 25%, suspend it for three years and give funding to our NGOs and directly to civil society organisations in Africa?  The sham taking place means our money is going to world banks.  If people in the Labour Party and others want to support the continuation of the process in this regard whereby there is not total transparency and accountability in the money we send in aid, that is fine.  However, we should reconsider the position.<\/p><p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to the National Asset Management Agency.  When I raised this matter last week, I received a rap on the knuckles from the head of relationship management at NAMA.

We have learned a great deal in the past 20 years and there is broad agreement that abortion is not a treatment for mental health problems and that the correct action to take is to treat people for such problems.  In framing the legislation we must ensure the most important matter to be considered is the intention in making the intervention.  The guiding principle in such interventions must be life saving as opposed to life destroying or life taking in nature.  Like many others, I wish to ensure we will not deliver a wording which will, in time, open the door to abortion on demand in this country.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this matter as early as possible in the new year.  We should, perhaps, have a number of such debates in order that we might frame the most appropriate legislation to protect the lives of mothers and their children, where possible.

In the coming months there will be a great deal of reflection on the part of Deputies and Senators on yesterday's announcement.  They will inform themselves and take soundings from their constituents and those they represent.  I hope that when we return to dealing with this matter in the new year, we will do so in a calm manner.  This is one of the biggest issues which this House and the Oireachtas in general will be obliged to confront since the foundation of the State.  My position on the matter has been clear at all times.  If the new legislation allows for the deliberate taking of the life of an innocent baby, it will be repugnant to everything I believe about human rights.  It is important, therefore, to be honest and have integrity when discussing the lives and welfare of mothers.  Both sides in the debate must adhere to the facts and express their views on how they believe we should move forward in this matter.

A startling fact is that one in six of the calls they have been receiving is due to calls from people who are worried about different situations because of recessionary issues.  They have more than 1,400 volunteers working with them, of which more than 100 are in Galway and most branches would have over 100 volunteers who give 15 hours per month.  It is very important that we should acknowledge that Christmas will not necessarily be a happy time for everybody but we commend the work of people like the Samaritans who provide help during the Christmas period for those who find this time difficult.  Their telephone is 1850609090.  May I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the new years on the supports available for people who are finding it difficult to cope in these times of economic austerity and whether they are adequate to deal with the numbers of people under pressure?

In fairness to the Government, there is a mechanism of checking and cross checking all moneys allocated by the Department or the EU.  Mistakes are made and sometimes things are not done in the way they are supposed to be done.  As an MEP, I employed people in Brussels as research assistants, one of whom subsequently got a job supervising EU projects in Iraq and was responsible for cross-checking that the moneys for projects were properly spent.  For a member to suggest there is no audit system and the funding given is going willy-nilly to governments to do what they like with it, is absolutely and totally outrageous and incorrect.  It is wrong that a Member should come into the Chamber and give the impression to the general public that Departments are not ensuring that the money given are being used properly.  Let me give an example, a family member works in Kenya in a school in which the pupil-teacher is 1:70 and the cost of a teacher is \u20ac1,200 per annum.  I think that by providing \u20ac1,200 to a country in order to employ an extra teacher is a significant help.  That is an example of the value we are getting for our money.  Likewise, agencies such as Tr\u00f3caire and Concern are using the aid effectively and constructively and are generating a return of ten times more than a government can deliver.  This money is being used in a constructive manner.  It is wrong to suggest that money is being used for the purchase of arms and ammunition and is being misused by the third country governments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900006#E00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1355914800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Good news often passes by without comment.

When the draft heads of the Bill have been prepared, a comprehensive debate will take place at the joint committee and with the public before the Bill and the accompanying regulations are finalised.  The aim of the Government's action is to provide for clarity and legal certainty in the process of determining whether a termination of pregnancy is permissible in cases in which there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as opposed to the health, of a woman.  That is the Government's position on the report of the expert group.  I am sure we will have many more debates in the House on the matter before the legislation and the regulations are provided for.  I assure those Members who have stated that this may lead to abortion on demand that that certainly will not be the case.<\/p><p>Senator David Norris raised the matter of the appalling murder of three people in Pakistan.

A White Paper written in 1999 promised to resolve the conflict between the Minister's ownership of a health insurance company and the responsibility to regulate the market.  We are still discussing that conflict.  Some of these negotiations remind me of the west Clare railway.  The problem is that operating in this way is worth approximately &#8364;45 million per year to VHI.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has indicated the scheme which the Minister proposes will be worth even more.  It currently costs &#8364;1 million per week if VHI is not properly regulated and it will be the sole beneficiary of a scheme that could be worth two or three times that amount.  We have to allow for the possibility that some of the success of the competing firms, until the Department moved against them, was because they were able to sell health insurance more cheaply to young and old people alike.<\/p><p>  This is a badly regulated insurance company and that is why I seek to transfer responsibility for regulating it away from the Health Insurance Authority to the Central Bank, which is what we were told to do by the European Court of Justice in September 2012.  We issued a statement in February to the effect that we would obey the ruling but another year has passed without action.  In the meantime the market is totally distorted, hugely expensive and people are giving up health insurance, thereby frustrating the objective I share with the Minister of increasing the number of people with health insurance.  The Department of Health has received the Milliman report, which identified all the inefficiencies that monopolies exhibit.  We must move to a different model and stop losing court cases in Europe and the Supreme Court by defending the company.  The VHI was the Department's monopoly company for 50 years until it was reluctantly forced by the EU to allow competition.  It has never really accepted the need for competition and it continually tries to change the rules to disadvantage the other companies.  When CIE was up to the same thing with the Department of Transport, Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon stated in a High Court ruling:<ul>The Department, because of the privileged position of the notice party as an exempt body [CIE], should have been hypersensitive to the competing interest of the private licence operators in applying the guidelines.  In dealing with the notice party first, the Department was not only ignoring its own guidelines, but was doing so where the person being favoured was already an exempt body and already had an advantage over the applicant.  To ignore the guidelines in such circumstances doubly disadvantaged the applicant.<\/ul>That is what the Department of Health has been doing and it is also what the Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice told us.  <\/p><p>  I accept the ruling of the Chair that we cannot discuss amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 but we are being asked, as lawmakers, to condone breaches of the law.  It is not good enough that despite publishing a White Paper in 1999 which promised to regularise the VHI situation, we are still in discussions with the Central Bank.  This will not attract new insurers.  In economics the bad guys are the incumbents because they are always seeking regulatory capture, which VHI has managed to do in respect of the Department of Health.  New entrants give the market its dynamic but, as the Supreme Court has noted, they face serious discrimination in the health insurance model.  By pretending to ignore a ruling of the European Court of Justice, the Minister is damaging the entire sector.<\/p><p>  The Supreme Court judgment noted &quot;there was a prima facie interference with the property rights of BUPA as guaranteed by the Constitution which the State was bound to justify&quot; and that where a scheme has &quot;potentially serious implications for legal rights, including constitutional rights, of persons or corporations, one must expect that the intended ambit or application of such provisions will be expressed in the legislation with reasonable clarity.&quot;<\/p><p>  Ignoring this issue will not make it go away.  The previous High Court judgment found, &quot;This scheme involves some elements of anti-competitive behaviour in that the pricing structure of the market is interfered with and entry is less attractive.&quot;  This is what we are being asked to sweep under the carpet.  Everybody who has examined the issue independently has urged the Department to divest itself of owning an insurance company.  This was expressed by the McCarthy review of State companies.<\/p><p>  This is a financial service and the proper regulator is the Central Bank.  VHI should have been transferred a long time ago to the Department of Industry and Commerce or some other such Department.  We will have to send the record of this debate to the European Court of Justice to show how lightly its decisions are taken when we draft legislation which is essential to the operation of a proper health insurance market.  I regret the bills that we are running up in defending these court cases.  Why are we not now availing of the opportunity to make ourselves legally correct in the way we regulate health insurance in Ireland?  The Health Insurance Authority condones the current arrangement and says that risk equalisation will be worth much more to VHI.  Setting out to deliberately rig the market in health insurance or anything else is something in which the IMF will be interested.  We are borrowing money to fight court cases in order to prevent competition in health insurance.  I take that seriously.<\/p><p>  I propose that regulation be moved to the Central Bank because the Department has no credibility in this matter.  The Health Insurance Authority, which is a quango of the Department, also lacks credibility.  When we play a match we are entitled to a neutral referee and scorekeeper.  The Department never had evidence that the other companies refused to insure old or sick people.  It is not possible to tell from an application form whether an applicant is sick.  <\/p> <p>As the Minister is aware, the records show they were insuring both young and old people for less than what VHI charges.  That is what caused the panic in the Department, not that old people were not being insured.  The Department has invented a bogus model of the health insurance market to justify what it is doing.  The primary justification was the denial of access by old people to health insurance.  We have had enough court cases about it.  The Minister has not produced evidence of a single person who was denied health insurance at the same price, with community rating, lifetime cover and open enrolment.  All of those criteria were adhered to but that was not enough for VHI.  It controls the Department and therefore it wants even more draconian laws against competitors, even when those laws result in a 23% rise in claims and 200,000 people leaving the system.  We know what the Department was at; it is plain as the nose on anybody's face.  It was protecting the VHI but what about the alleged issue that there is a problem with old people?  I want that independently evaluated and not by any agents of VHI or the Health Insurance Authority.<\/p><p>I have a paper by Robert Fogel of the University of Chicago in which he states that increases in life expectancy during the 21st century will be fairly large but the effect on health care will be modest.  Another example we can put before the Central Bank or any neutral person is from the health education research committee of the University of Oxford which states that age is in part a red herring in relation to health expenditure; proximity to death is more important.  To paraphrase a James Bond spoof, you only die once.<\/p><p>We know that the Department was defending VHI, and that is what it has always done, but I need independent evidence that, first, somebody ever refused to insure old people in Ireland and, second, that the old are the problem.  That is what the Department continues to tell us is the problem but in that regard I have quoted evidence from Oxford and Chicago universities.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 4, as a first step I want the Minister to give some indication that fairness will intrude into this field by transferring that actuarial function to the Central Bank, which is the Financial Regulator for all the financial sector.  This health insurance company should always have been regulated by the Central Bank.  That is the European Court decision and that is what the Minister was discussing with them last February.  He has had enough time to reach a decision given its promise since 1999.  At least let them prepare the studies so that people might have some confidence that when they get estimates of what individuals should pay for health insurance, it is soundly actuarially based rather than protectionism raising an ugly head in the Department of Health and in the Health Insurance Authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900009#H00100","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355916900,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The Senator should be aware that amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 20 are being taken together.

It is time to involve the Central Bank to a much greater extent and divest the Department of Health from the contradictory role of owning an insurance company and pretending to regulate the market in the interests of old people, when actually it is looking after its own incumbent insurance company.

I note the comments made by Senator Barrett about the amendments.  Regarding amendment No. 4 he is talking about the Central Bank having a role.  I would have no objection to that but it is not appropriate in this case.  It is something that should be examined in the long term.<\/p><p>I had my own difficulties with VHI in the past 12 months.  I was surprised to find in a submission to the Joint Committee on Health and Children by the VHI that there was only a 60% occupancy rate of private beds in the hospitals in Cork.  I found it difficult to understand that figure.  I found it difficult to understand VHI's decisions in regard to competition in Cork.  I agree with Senator Barrett that there is a need for competition in the health insurance area but when we consider the current age profile of VHI members it does have the vast majority of the age group over the age of 65.<\/p><p>The Senator referred to the cost of health care for the elderly.  It is interesting that the recent statistics in the Health in Ireland Key Trends 2012 report show that the over 65 age group had a 49.2% occupancy rate of hospital beds which is a clear indication that our health care system is providing comprehensive health care for people over the age of 65.<\/p><p>An issue that arises with older patients is that on many occasions they will occupy a bed for a longer period than the average person.  I note that the average occupancy rate in our hospitals has reduced slightly from over six days to under five days per admission.  In the older age group that occupancy rate is a higher number of days, therefore, there is a higher expenditure level and a higher demand on the insurer.<\/p><p>On the health care area, it is interesting to see how we have moved forward in recent years.  There is a great deal of criticism of health care.  It is about making it more efficient because if we make our health services more efficient we help to reduce the cost of insurance.  It is interesting to note that the number of day procedures has increased from over 353,000 to over 881,000 per annum.  Over 60% of all procedures in hospitals now are day procedures, which is a welcome development.<\/p><p>It is interesting to note also the increase in the number of outpatient attendances which has gone from over 2,185,000 per annum to over 3,583,000 per annum, which is a huge increase.  That means that follow-up and access to hospital services has increased dramatically.<\/p><p>There is a great deal of criticism of the health care system, some of it justified and some of it exaggerated but people are not looking at the bigger picture in terms of the numbers of procedures being performed that have increased dramatically in recent years.  If we increase the level of hospital care we also increase the level of demand on insurance companies.  That is one of the issues that arose in the debate in Cork.  If we increased the number of beds available for private health care there would be an increased demand on the insurance company.  The speed of the delivery of health care must be increased because that will result in a saving in the long term.<\/p><p>In dealing with the health insurance area we must have much more planning in terms of the way people look after their own health.  Rather than looking after their health when a problem arises they should look after their health to prevent problems arising.  I am not sure we are doing enough in that regard.  They have done an audit on that in one European country which allowed people access to health care in terms of providing a full audit of their health needs.  In that way problems are identified at an early stage and that results in a huge saving.<\/p> <p>We need to do a lot more on that.  The figures produced in the recent study, Health in Ireland: Key Trends in 2012, show that the consumption of alcohol and smoking trends have not changed dramatically.  All the work being done in heath care is negatived given that not enough is being done in the area of alcohol and smoking.  That is something that needs to be done in forward planning.  <\/p><p>In regard to Senator Barrett's amendment which seeks that the Central Bank of Ireland shall conduct an annual actuarial analysis of the health insurance market, that is something that needs to be done.  I do not know if this is the appropriate Bill to deal with the issue.  However, there is a need to keep a careful watch on value for money from the insurance point of view especially when moving forward to universal health care.  That is another reason to ensure we get value for money from the health insurers.  We must ensure that those who provide health care also give value for money and that moneys are being spent unnecessarily when huge savings could be made.  There is a need to far more cost effective in that area.  Obviously the Minister will respond to the amendments.  If amendment No. 4 is not dealt with under this Bill it is an issue that should be examined for the long-term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900010#J00600","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355917500,"counter":164,"content":"<p>Many statements have been made here.  I thank Senators for engaging with the Bill.  The Central Bank is the Financial Regulator for the country and, as such, regulates for matters governing the prudential and solvency requirements for the health insurance market.  Insurers wishing to operate in the Irish market must satisfy the Central Bank and other requirements before they are authorised to operate in the Irish market.  It is the role and responsibility of the Central Bank to keep these issues under review and matters such as those raised by Senator Barrett are not appropriate to this legislation and, therefore, I cannot accept these amendments.  However, I wish to say a few words about some of the comments he has made and also, perhaps, to address the issue of costs in VHI.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Barrett that monopolies are bad.  That is why under UHI we will have competing health insurers obviously heavily regulated by the Health Insurance Authority.  I would point out that VHI has one of the lowest administrative costs of any insurer in the western world.  I would also put it to him that if older people were not the heavier users of the service why is it that none of the new people who entered the market have not sought to attract them?  I do not have the exact figures with me but one of the new insurers has attracted 40% of younger people.  Clearly that is because they are producing products that attract younger people?  Why are they not producing products that attract older people?  It is glaringly obvious to everybody that his contention that older people are not greater users of the service is utterly wrong and misleading.  While I do not have a vast array of information with me to underpin that I do have one piece of information that can be checked and verified, namely, that the average cost of a medical card is \u20ac1,000 or thereabouts.  The average cost of a medical card for the over 70s is about \u20ac2,500.  If that does not make the argument clear I do not know what does.<\/p><p>The Senator made other contentions.  I have the report from the Health Insurance Authority from last month, page 13 of which states that the net cost for those aged 80 to 84 is 3.3 times that for the age group 18 to 29.  I utterly reject that contention.  Regretfully, I have to say to Senator Barrett that he is misleading the House with his selective quoting from the High Court case.  The High Court case vindicated community rating and said there was a justifiable interference in the interests of the common good.  It found against on one point only.  <\/p><p>The European Court of Justice did not tell us that the Health Insurance Authority should not regulate VHI.  It is for the Central Bank to regulate on prudential issues.  In terms of the response to money for VHI insurers seeking to take on its older people, we have had a number of new entrants into the market.  We have had two new players in the market in 2012, Swiss Re which underwrites Laya Healthcare and Munich Re which underwrites Glo Health.  As everybody is aware the VHI share of the market is falling consistently and is down to 57%, yet it is responsible for 80% of the payout because of the much older profile of its clients.  As a Government we said we would address the issues arising from the European Court of Justice case by the end of 2013.  I cannot accept the Senator's contention around older people not being greater users of the service nor do I accept a very misleading comment he has made in respect of the High Court case.  I regret I cannot accept the Senator's amendments and ask the House to reject them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900011#K00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1355917500,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Does Senator Barrett wish to come back in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900011#K00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1355917500,"counter":166,"content":"<p>We asked for an independent referee and, obviously, the Minister does not want to concede that request, given the record.  It is good that Ireland should be compliant with European Union law in these matters and not further bias the market.<\/p><p>   We have the Milliman report, which has 31 pages of redactions in a total of 67 pages, and it shows repeatedly that the VHI problems are caused largely by itself.  A table on page 31 indicates that an average length of stay in a VHI bed is 10.6 days whereas in a well-managed system it should be 3.7 days.  For surgical procedures the VHI pays for 7.5 days but in a well managed system the length of stay should be 3.7.  On page 33 the report states: &quot;We found little evidence of any attempt by VHI to control hospital utilisation effectively....&quot;.  The report states on page 36 that VHI has focused a great deal of management time and resources in assessing the contribution of the risk difference in its claims caused by its old people and neglected efficiency issues.  That is all in the report the Department has had.  We rely on competition to get those out of the system, not requiring the new entrants to compensate the old people.  <\/p><p>  I thank our colleague, Senator Colm Burke, who raised very interesting points on this issue, that VHI and the system in general has to address costs.  It reminds me of the Aer Lingus monopoly days when there were all sorts of Government Ministers appealing to Aer Lingus to do A, B and C.  Competition achieved it far better.  To require the new entrants to compensate the incumbents on grounds which are disputed both in Oxford and in Kings -<b><\/b>there is something in what the Minister said but not the obsession which this legislation encompasses and which has been the obsession of VHI that in some way all its competitors have cheated.  I recall the 50th anniversary of Ronnie Delaney winning his gold medal when one of the competitors said, &quot;If you can remember this buy some health insurance.&quot;  There are many other ways the Minister could have addressed that problem if it was a problem.  He could have taken inducements from the VHI to transfer its older members to the new entrants.  He could have asked the new entrants to recruit a certain ratio of old people to its younger recruits.  He could have had an ombudsman as in car insurance where young people who used to be refused cover could go to the Department and get the cover.

I must point out, however, that there is no question of the health market being allowed to operate as a free market because the risk for older people is much greater.  Senator Barrett is deluding himself and misleading the House if he believes it could be otherwise.  I cannot believe that as an economist he believes that, although he has great experience and may have provided advice to insurance companies in the past.  If competition is allowed to operate freely in this area, younger people's premiums will fall and older people's premiums will become unaffordable.  Those who are less well or who have a chronic illness will find it nearly impossible to insure themselves.  That is reality.  That is how the car insurance market works where young drivers who crash frequently end up paying a heavy premium.  That is just the way it is.  Senator Barrett knows that and I know that.  Risk equalisation underpins community rating and the latter is something all sides in the Houses have supported.  It remains a core value.  Younger, well people subsidise less well, older people.  Many of those who are entering their later years subsidised older people when they were younger.  It is an underlying principle which remains in place and forms part of the Government's policy.  We are not moving away from it.<\/p><p>I did not address the issue of cost as comprehensively as I might have.  The HIA continually monitors and reviews health insurance experiences and expertise from other countries and, where appropriate, carries out international research.  It is an independent body.  In preparing its report on risk equalisation for the Minister in 2010, it engaged consultants to review as part of their analysis the operation of risk equalisation and community-rated health insurance systems in other countries.  The HIA maintains regular contacts with corresponding public regulatory bodies in other countries and exchanges research.  They have this system in Holland and Germany, to name but two other countries.  Risk equalisation must be put in place to level the market.  I return to the original question I asked Senator Barrett which was to ask why so few older people are members of the newer companies when those newer companies are eating into the market in a significant way.  Why does the VHI have 80% of the payout costs but only 57% of the market?  The answer is that VHI members are much older.  Older people use services more and present a greater risk.  That is a fact which any actuary will confirm.  I cannot accept Senator Barrett's contentions.<\/p><p>I have made it very clear that I want the VHI to address its cost base.  To be fair, it has over the last couple of years reduced consultant fees by 15%, overall costs by \u20ac200 million and prices for various procedures by between 13% and 53%.  It has introduced a revised payments system for radiologists and pathologists.  I want the VHI to do more.  As I said in the House previously, I want the VHI to focus on audits, particularly clinical audit.  I am astonished it has not had clinical audit before now but it will be introduced and clinicians will be challenged by colleagues on why tests have been carried out in the first instance.  I want the VHI to review why it pays what it pays.  Some procedures which used to take two hours now take only 20 minutes.  That has to be reviewed.  We have to change the way we pay.  The nonsense of paying per day in hospital must stop and procedure-based payment introduced.  While it will not always be possible to adopt that approach, in many cases it can be done.  Those hospitals which are efficient and get patients seen quickly with more day-case surgery and inpatient procedures will be rewarded.

The men and women who work in our health services have in fact improved it by reducing by 25% the number of people who have to endure long trolley waits, although I acknowledge that we still have a long way to go.  They reduced the inpatient waiting times by 91% for people who wait nine months or longer for a procedure and 18% for those who wait three months.  There are 800 fewer children on our waiting lists now than at the same time last year.  I commend them on the extraordinary work they do against a background of less money and fewer staff.  We have also seen a higher birthrate this year than previously.  The birthrate was approximately 60,000 five years ago but it is more than 75,000 now.  The current numbers of medical cards, at 1.8 million, and GP visit cards are the highest in the history of the State.<\/p><p>I do not accept the Senator's contention that we cannot fully regulate a market of competing insurers.  It has been done elsewhere and we will do it here.  If he keeps focusing on the amount of money invested and the number of doctors, nurses and allied care professionals working the system instead of how they are ensuring that the right patient is seen by the right professional at the right time and in the right place, we will continue to do what we always did, that is, pour money and resources into the system without getting the results we want.  Only last January 569 people were on trolleys in this country, after several years in which we quadrupled the amount of funding for the health service and increased the numbers of doctors, nurses and allied care professionals.  If that approach was going to cure the problem it would have done so a long time ago.  What we require is a system that allows the many excellent professionals who work in our service to deliver the excellence they want to deliver.  This will give us a health service in which people feel safe and which gives pride to those who work in it not just some of the time but all the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900016#P00900","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1355920200,"counter":208,"content":"<p>It is constructive to set out a vision for health care and it is relevant to this Bill to do so given that it deals with regulating the system and risk equalisation.  The Bill reflects the Minister's plans for the future of health care but we take a fundamentally different view.  Ours is not a fanciful view.  We believe health care should be delivered on the basis of equity, free at the point of delivery, funded through general taxation and available on the basis of need.  We have developed a health plan and I can send the Minister a copy of our latest health policy document if he wishes to take the time to read it.<\/p><p>He appears to agree with certain parts of our plan.  We apply the full cost of private patients in public hospitals.  He is going some way in that direction in the budget so that taxpayers do not have to subsidise private health insurance.  We also call for savings to be made on drug distribution and use of generics.  He has gone some of the way on that.  I make no apologies for saying that we do not want consultants to avail of taxpayers' money to pursue private practice in public hospitals.  That does not detract from the good work that all consultants do in our hospitals.  The Minister was robust in arguing that consultant contracts needed to be renegotiated.  I did not hear the same criticism from Senator Burke in regard to taking care with what we say about consultants when the Minister was doing the right thing in addressing the issue of consultant contracts, although that did not work out in the way he expected.<\/p><p>What he is trying to do here is unnatural and it will not work in the long term.  The natural way to provide health care is as a public service funded through taxation and delivered on the basis of need.  Private health insurance companies are solely motivated by profit.  They are in this game to make money from people's need for health care.  The Minister wants to open up our entire health care system to the private health insurance market but we do not want to see that happen.  We are not alone in taking this attitude.  I read with interest the IMPACT analysis of his plans for the future of the health service.  It was scathing of the way in which the health care system in the Netherlands created a more inequitable and inefficient system of health care.  The Minister can shake his head but I am entitled to my view.<\/p> <p>I am not obsessed with inputs.  I believe we must change work practices and that we must create health care settings where all health care professionals can provide the best health care possible.  They are doing a Trojan job in difficult circumstances, despite all the cutbacks and reductions we have seen in wards, theatres and staff, and are trying their best to provide the best health care possible.  We must also create greater efficiencies.  The Minister may remember from his time in opposition that we have called for a health funding commission to be established to look at where we spend money in the health system and where money is being wasted so as to ensure we spend taxpayers' money on delivering frontline services rather than waste it on administration, branded medicines or on subsidising private health care.<\/p><p>That is our vision of the health service.  It is obvious the Minister does not intend to accept our amendment, but I will press it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900016#P01000","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355920800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I do not want to delay progress, but I must challenge some of the assertions made by Senator Cullinane.  I apologise for not addressing some of the issues he raised in the context of bigger hospitals and money following the patient.  I believe smaller hospitals will be well able to compete and will have an advantage in this area.  We intend to ensure that people are not sent to have procedures carried out in bigger hospitals where they could be carried out in smaller hospitals.  This is part of the underlying principle of treating the patient at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as close to home as possible.  We do not want people with inguinal hernias and gall bladders being sent to Waterford or Galway when they could be treated in Roscommon, Clonmel or wherever.<\/p><p>  I believe the money follows the patient.  I have the document on that and it will be ready to go to the Government shortly.  This is another big step on our road to reforming the system.  Senator Cullinane mentioned Sinn F\u00e9in's plan and I would welcome sight of that plan.  I reject what the Senator had to say about the consultant contract.  The talks at the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, were very successful.  For the first time, we have an agreement that consultants will be contractually obliged to work any of the hours 24\/7 as opposed to Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  I accept what Senator Burke has said, that many consultants have been doing this<i> pro bono,<\/i> not as part of their contract.  The clinical programmes which encourage this sort of work practice saved us 70,000 bed days last year, the equivalent of &#8364;63 million.  I acknowledge the work done by the consultants.  However, I cannot run the health service on a <i>pro bono<\/i> basis, which is why the LRC talks were so important.<\/p><p>  Another benefit arising from the LRC talks is the fact we now have clinical directors with real powers, in terms of directing their consultant colleagues and how and where they work and in regard to their obligations.  Furthermore, because consultants are leaders within the health service, they are now leading from the front, which will make it easier for other members of the caring professions to follow suit in terms of showing flexibility around rostering, etc.<\/p><p>  Some Members seem to assume the Government is fully adopting the Dutch model, but that is not the case.  We are designing an Irish model of universal health insurance that will best meet the needs of the Irish system and citizens.  As I said before, when it came to the insurance model, we looked at the Dutch model, when it came to the patient safety authority, we looked at the Danish and Canadian models, when it came to the trust model for hospitals, we looked at the United Kingdom model and when it came to how we could improve performance within our service and the special delivery units, SDUs, we looked at the North of Ireland model.  We do not have any one system.  We are choosing the best elements of the other systems that we believe will best suit our purposes.<\/p><p>  Of course, Senator Cullinane is entitled to his view, but that does not make his view a fact.  The fact in the case of the Dutch system is that the cost increase is due to the extension of the scheme to cover dental care.  I do not accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900017#Q00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355920800,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Question, &quot;That the word proposed to be deleted stand&quot;, put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355920800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355920800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Section 2 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355920800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>SECTION  3<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355920800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 in the name of Senator Barrett is out of order as it is consequential to amendment No. 2, which is not relevant to the subject matter of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900017#Q00700","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355920800,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355920800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Section 3 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355920800,"counter":218,"content":"<p>SECTION  4<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355920800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<ul><br>In page 6, lines 12 to 14, to delete paragraphs (<i>b<\/i>) and (<i>c<\/i>).<\/ul>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure we have adequate scrutiny of regulations and maximum oversight and transparency.

This provision is necessary and I will explain why.  God knows, we have had enough concerns about regulation in this country, so much so that, when in opposition, I did not like to even talk about having a regulator of the health insurance agency and much preferred to talk about having a scrutineer because regulation had become devalued.  If we are to have serious regulation, regulators need real teeth and there have to be consequences for individuals, as well as organisations.  As they say, success has many parents and failure is always an orphan.  It is the same in this case.  When something goes wrong and one tries to find out who is responsible, suddenly nobody knows anything about anything.  We need to have a situation where the people who work for these organisations, if they are asked to delay in providing information for the HIA or give it in such a way that it will mislead the HIA, know there will be consequences.  A fine is one thing for an organisation, but it is important for an individual working in it to realise there will be personal consequences for him or her also.  We should, therefore, maintain this section.  It is a sign of our seriousness in regulating this market and insurers that, if people try to play fast and loose, they will suffer the consequences.  One of the things we said before we entered government was that we would bring transparency and accountability to this issue and that perhaps then we might have some chance of ensuring fairness.  This is to underpin that accountability in order to ensure there will be fairness.<\/p><p>I would prefer if the Senator could see his way to withdrawing his objection.

However, there are a few points I want to make, more on the general tenor of the Bill.<\/p><p>  When I heard my colleague talk earlier about the evil markets, I was reminded of the <i>comparethemarket.com<\/i> advertisement, on which the little meerkat accused people of confusing the term &quot;compare the market&quot; with &quot;compare the meerkat&quot;.  There is such a problem like in this instance.  There is an assumption that markets always mean &quot;for profit&quot; and Darwinian survival of the fittest and starvation of the poorest.  While I am sorry my colleague is not present to hear this, he needs to understand the market in many parts of the world is a socialised one.  The idea is that market forces are brought to bear which allows patients to have a choice in where they go for health care, what doctors they see and institutions they attend.  These patients are equally empowered by the possession of a uniform insurance instrument which gives no citizen an advantage over any other in terms of access to health care and obliges every hospital and doctor to regard patients equally because of this solitary transferable insurance instrument.  That is the system in Israel which has a number of not-for-profit health systems that compete against each other.  It is the system in place in Canada where there is one provincial health insurer to which everybody has access.  It is the system in place in Germany where a mixture of public and private insurers provide a generally uniform insurance instrument for citizens who can use it to freely negotiate in any part of the health system they wish to attend.<\/p><p>  Her Majesty's United Kingdom National Health Service, so beloved of colleagues here, consistently ranks among the poorest performing health systems in the developed world.  That is a fact.  Many have a misty-eyed, nostalgic love of the NHS because it was born of a wonderful egalitarian impulse in the grey bomb-strewn ashes of the post-Second World War United Kingdom.  However, it has not moved with the times and instead perhaps owes more to the philosophy of Stalin in the way it actually delivers services than it does to a more modern approach.  It consistently has the worst cancer survival rates and the longest waiting lists.  In fact, if it was not for Ireland, the United Kingdom would have the longest waiting lists in the world.  If one looks at a league table of OECD countries in terms of access to care, one striking feature is that the top five countries all use the alternative model - still socialised, still responsive and still based on need, not ability to pay - which is the Bismarckian model of a uniform insurance instrument.  This is the model I know the Minister intends moving towards and it is the one we need to move towards.<\/p><p>  I would like to finish with some quick points.  We have heard much said today about consultants.  I specifically came into this Chamber not as an advocate or defender of consultants and I have not tried to represent that constituency.

This directive, informally known as the gender goods and services directive, implements the principle of equal treatment between men and women in access to and supply of goods and services.  In its decision of 1 March 2011, in a case taken by a Belgian consumer rights organisation, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared that Article 5(2) of the directive would be invalid with effect from 21 December 2012.  This decision, known as the Test-Achats ruling, is binding on all member states of the EU.  The provision that was struck down had allowed an exception from the principle of equal treatment enunciated in the regulation so that insurance companies could price life and motor insurance products differently for men and women, where this difference is reasonable and supported by actuarial or statistical data.  Ireland availed of this exemption in the Equal Status Act 2000, permitting gender differentiation to continue in the areas of motor insurance, life assurance, critical illness cover, income protection cover and private annuities and pensions.<\/p><p>The effect of the ruling is that Ireland is obliged to prohibit, by law, the selling of private insurance products which differentiate, by gender, on price or benefits and to have such provisions in force on or before 21 December 2012.  The unisex rule will apply to all contracts concluded for the first time as and from that date.  It also applies to agreements between parties as and from 21 December 2012 to extend contracts concluded before that date, which would otherwise have expired.  The European Commission has issued guidance on the application of this judgment on national legislation transposing Council Directive 2004\/113\/EC and on insurance industry practices.<\/p><p>I have taken due regard to this guidance - and to the intention stated in the directive to avoid a sudden readjustment of the insurance market - in determining the amendments to the Equal Status Acts necessary to ensure compliance with the ruling.  As I will explain, these amendments are largely technical in nature.  For me and my colleagues in government, this ruling highlights the crucial importance of achieving legal clarity in the drafting of legislation at European level to ensure that such instruments are interpreted and have the impact intended.  The Government is conscious of the potential for confusion and misinformation among consumers and insurance providers alike of these changes to the private insurance market.  For this reason, in October the Department of Justice and Equality published an information note for consumers on the new rules on the permitted use of gender by insurance providers and sources of further information and advice.  The information note is widely available through public information channels such as the Citizens Information Board.  It is also available on the Department's website.  I wish to again express our thanks to the industry bodies - the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Brokers Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association and the Society of Actuaries in Ireland - which, along with the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau, contributed to the preparation of this advice for consumers.<\/p><p>In some quarters, the potential for this change to lead to increases in the premiums charged, not least in motor insurance and life assurance, has given rise to concern.  The Government takes seriously concerns expressed about the risk that some providers might seek to exploit the change to maximise their profits to the detriment of consumers.

This directive, informally known as the gender goods and services directive, implements the principle of equal treatment between men and women in access to and supply of goods and services.  In its decision of 1 March 2011, in a case taken by a Belgian consumer rights organisation, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared that Article 5(2) of the directive would be invalid with effect from 21 December 2012.  This decision, known as the Test-Achats ruling, is binding on all member states of the EU.  The provision that was struck down had allowed an exception from the principle of equal treatment enunciated in the regulation so that insurance companies could price life and motor insurance products differently for men and women, where this difference is reasonable and supported by actuarial or statistical data.  Ireland availed of this exemption in the Equal Status Act 2000, permitting gender differentiation to continue in the areas of motor insurance, life assurance, critical illness cover, income protection cover and private annuities and pensions.<\/p><p>The effect of the ruling is that Ireland is obliged to prohibit, by law, the selling of private insurance products which differentiate, by gender, on price or benefits and to have such provisions in force on or before 21 December 2012.  The unisex rule will apply to all contracts concluded for the first time as and from that date.  It also applies to agreements between parties as and from 21 December 2012 to extend contracts concluded before that date, which would otherwise have expired.  The European Commission has issued guidance on the application of this judgment on national legislation transposing Council Directive 2004\/113\/EC and on insurance industry practices.<\/p><p>I have taken due regard to this guidance - and to the intention stated in the directive to avoid a sudden readjustment of the insurance market - in determining the amendments to the Equal Status Acts necessary to ensure compliance with the ruling.  As I will explain, these amendments are largely technical in nature.  For me and my colleagues in government, this ruling highlights the crucial importance of achieving legal clarity in the drafting of legislation at European level to ensure that such instruments are interpreted and have the impact intended.  The Government is conscious of the potential for confusion and misinformation among consumers and insurance providers alike of these changes to the private insurance market.  For this reason, in October the Department of Justice and Equality published an information note for consumers on the new rules on the permitted use of gender by insurance providers and sources of further information and advice.  The information note is widely available through public information channels such as the Citizens Information Board.  It is also available on the Department's website.  I wish to again express our thanks to the industry bodies - the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Brokers Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association and the Society of Actuaries in Ireland - which, along with the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection, the Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency, the Citizens Information Board, the Pensions Board, the Equality Authority and the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau, contributed to the preparation of this advice for consumers.<\/p><p>In some quarters, the potential for this change to lead to increases in the premiums charged, not least in motor insurance and life assurance, has given rise to concern.  The Government takes seriously concerns expressed about the risk that some providers might seek to exploit the change to maximise their profits to the detriment of consumers.  It was made very clear to the industry - in consultations on the Bill - that the State's consumer protection and insurance regulatory bodies do not view such developments favourably.  The Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority each has specific statutory roles in promoting and protecting consumer interests, which will be engaged as needed.  This is in addition to the investigative and advisory powers of the Equality Authority in respect of discriminatory practices by insurance providers and the existing individual complaints mechanism under the Equal Status Acts, which will continue to apply.<\/p> <p>I should stress that it has also been made very clear to the industry that the European Commission intends to monitor the evolution of the insurance market and of overall price levels post-December 2012.  The Commission has not ruled out taking appropriate action in the event of anti-competitive conduct by insurance providers.<\/p><p>I now wish to highlight some of the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the amendment of section 5 of the Equal Status Act 2000.  It limits the existing derogation from the prohibition on gender discrimination in specified insurance products - provided in section 5 of the Equal Status Act - to contracts concluded before 21 December 2012.  This is to ensure that the prohibition on gender-differentiated insurance, with effect from 21 December 2012, will not affect existing contracts lawfully entered into before that date.  The scope of the prohibition is then expanded by providing in a new subsection (4A) that all contracts within the categories of motor or life insurance concluded for the first time as and from 21 December 2012 must comply with the unisex rule.<\/p><p>For the avoidance of doubt - and because to determine otherwise would result in a sudden readjustment of the motor insurance market, contrary to the intention of the directive - the second paragraph of the new subsection provides that mid-term adjustments to motor insurance contracts concluded before 21 December 2012 are not considered to be new contracts for this purpose.  The section also provides that the obligation imposed on the Central Bank of Ireland to compile, maintain and publish data to support the existing derogation will cease to have effect from 21 December 2012.  The bank's obligation to maintain and publish data compiled before that date will not be affected.  Consequential to the cessation of this obligation, section 5 provides for the amendment of section 41 of the principal Act.  This section will have the effect of terminating the Minister's power, which is no longer required, to make regulations in respect of the data to be compiled, published and maintained by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 14 of the principal Act in order to clarify that insurance providers may continue to collect, store and use gender status or gender-related information which is bona fide intended for the purposes of reserving and internal pricing, reinsurance pricing and life and health underwriting.  For example, it is envisaged that insurance providers may continue to gather and use gender data in connection with offering gender-specific insurance products and options within contracts to cover conditions, such as breast cancer or prostate cancer, which exclusively or primarily concern males or females.<\/p><p>I have also taken the opportunity afforded in this Bill to address a minor procedural issue regarding equal status complaints referred to the Equality Tribunal for mediation.  Section 4 provides for the amendment of section 24 of the 2004 Act to extend the time available to persons who have referred such complaints to apply for resumption of the hearing in instances in which mediation has not resolved the dispute between the parties.  The amendment will extend the period after the issuance of a notice of non-resolution within which a complainant is allowed to make an application in writing for a resumption of the hearing from 28 days to 42 days.  This amendment applies the same conditions to complaints under the Equal Status Acts on failure of mediation which are already applicable to the resumption of complaints under the Employment Equality Acts.  The remaining provisions contained in the Bill are of a standard or technical nature.<\/p><p>I reiterate that the State has no option but to ensure that national law complies with the European Court of Justice's interpretation of the gender goods and services directive in this instance and I again draw the attention of the House to the essentially technical nature of these amendments.  I thank Senators for their attention and I look forward to the detailed discussions on the legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900020#T00300","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355922900,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Fianna F\u00e1il will be supporting the Bill.  It is unfortunate that it has become necessary to legislate in this area as a result of the ruling handed down by the European Court of Justice.  I understand the legislation must come into effect on 21 December next.  This is not happening before time.  I would go a step further in respect of this matter and demand that those who, in an aggressive fashion, took large sums of money primarily from young men - 98% of whom are very responsible - should be obliged to reimburse them for a risk that never existed.  When he turned 18, my eldest son purchased a car for \u00a31,000 and was obliged to pay insurance of \u00a32,900 in respect of it.  His sister, who is a year older than him, learned to drive the following year and obtained her insurance for \u00a3700 as a result of her gender.  That was absolutely scandalous.  My son has been driving for 12 years and he has never had an accident.  Active discrimination of this sort was commonplace at the time.  The excuse that young men are responsible for many road accidents has never been good enough.  I am glad the European Court of Justice has taken action to compel the Government to introduce legislation.  I am not making a political point here, because the previous Government should have acted in this regard.  This matter did not arise overnight and something should have been done about it long ago.  This is one of the areas in respect of which insurance companies are very quick to manoeuvre situations to their financial gain.<\/p><p>  Flood alerts have been issued in respect of Skibbereen and Bandon today.  Many business people and householders in these towns are no longer in a position to take out insurance on their properties as a result of previous flooding.  Where is the risk equality in such circumstances?  I have made the point on previous occasions that every person should be entitled to insurance, particularly in circumstances in which whatever happened is not his or her fault.  The towns to which I refer were not built on flood plains but they are now, as a result of climate change or whatever, being flooded quite regularly.  Some of the buildings in Skibbereen and Bandon are 200 or 300 years old.  There is no fairness in respect of this issue.<\/p><p>  The Government must ensure that the changes proposed in the Bill will not, as some observers fear, result in riskier behaviour on our roads.  A number of strict measures introduced by successive Governments and the Road Safety Authority, which deserves great credit, have made Irish roads substantially safer.  I predict that the figure for deaths on our roads this year will hopefully be the lowest recorded in my lifetime.  In the 1960s and 1970s, between 600 and 700 people were killed on our roads each year.  I accept that the condition of roads then was bad, but there were two thirds fewer vehicles on them.  I am glad we are going in the right direction in this regard.<\/p><p>  Overall insurance costs must be kept down for ordinary consumers who are struggling to make ends meet.  The changes that are being implemented on foot of the decision of the European Court of Justice should spur the Government on to tackle insurance costs in respect of all insurance holders.  Insurance companies should be encouraged to find ways to better measure risk taking by drivers in order to ensure that the costs are fairly borne by those who present the greatest threat.<\/p><p>  Perhaps the Minister of State and the Government will take the points I have made on board.  There is a need for a wide-ranging debate on insurance.  This is an old hobby horse of mine.  Many places throughout the country, including Kilkenny, Ballinasloe, Fermoy and Cork city, have been affected by flooding, which is very unfortunate.  I wrote to the Irish Insurance Federation in respect of this matter and I have raised it in the House on a few occasions.  I would laud any Minister or Department that tries to tackle the great injustice that exists in this regard.<\/p><p>  There was a time when I used to insure my car and house willy-nilly.  I never bothered to check my policies.  However, in the past four to five years - perhaps as a result of the recession - I have shopped around.  Many people now shop around in respect of their car and, in particular, house insurance.  It is worthwhile doing so because one will obtain value for money.  In one instance, I saved almost &#8364;300 by shopping around in respect of my house insurance.  Perhaps solicitors were to blame but people used to be afraid of under-insuring their properties because they believed that, in the event of a fire or whatever, their claims would be paid on a <i>pro-rata<\/i> basis and they would not receive the full amount.  The wheel has turned full circle because property values have fallen to such a degree.  Members of the public should be conscious of ensuring that realistic values are attached to their homes.  For example, a family home that was valued at &#8364;400,000 five to seven years ago is probably worth only &#8364;185,000 now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900021#U00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1355922900,"counter":259,"content":"<p>The cost of rebuilding must be taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900021#U00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1355922900,"counter":260,"content":"<p>Building costs have also fallen, as have site values.

I am aware of a house that was built by a local authority on Bear Island for a family in need.  The site was owned by the family.  There was a delay in building it and the cost involved fell from \u20ac200,000 to approximately \u20ac105,000.   Value for money could be obtained and builders were competitive in their prices.  As many people who worked in the construction industry are unemployed, one can get good value for money if one shops around.<\/p><p>We fully support the Bill.  As a result of a lack of action dating back not only during the term of this Government but a number of years, Europe has propelled and forced us to make changes that I view as very appropriate.

I would make two points that may be slightly irrelevant but in a sense they are connected to the debate on this legislation and to the previous debate given that the Minister of the State is taking the Bill.  They relate to the question of the equality of what is being forced upon us or the measures we are bringing about as a result of a European directive.  The Minister of State will probably concede that her political career took off in a major fashion, certainly in a public way, arising from a European directive on equality of social welfare treatment.  It was a campaign which the Minister of State, who was then I presume a councillor, led in the Cork region, which was under way for a long time and eventually, from a social welfare perspective, women throughout the country benefited from a decision taken in Europe.<\/p><p>  However, it is interesting we are having this debate immediately after the debate on the foggy area of health insurance and risk equalisation, and decisions apparently being forced upon us from outside this House.  Decisions coming from Brussels are generally beneficial, as was the equal status in terms of social welfare treatment.  If this legislation was to result in the cost of insurance dropping for every citizen in this country, we would welcome it with open arms, but we have to be a little more cynical and patient and ask what exactly will be its impact.  The march of equality in this regard will result possibly in car insurance premiums being increased for every female driver in the country.  That is a little ironic but I suspect there will not be any corresponding drop in the price of motor insurance for male drivers.  That will have to be strongly monitored.  <\/p><p>  I agree with a good deal of what the previous speaker said, whether we are discussing the subject of car, house or health insurance.  The response of the consumer during the past decade sadly has been to pay the higher rate and to concede that the battle has been lost.  The response of every Government during the past ten or 15 years on the health insurance area has been to sanction increase after increase.  The previous Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, which I reluctantly had to support, will not help in that regard.  Judgments from Europe are fine and generally they are helpful but we have a big job of work to do at home to ensure, whether we are discussing equality or any other measure, that the consumer gets the best possible deal.<\/p><p>  The headlines we read about this legislation did not indicate, as sadly I noted, that male drivers will pay less but rather that female drivers will pay more.  That might be equality but it is not the best form of it.  We have said in the Seanad on many previous occasions that in regard to every item of legislation we pass, whether it be European or domestic legislation and whether it be on health insurance, car insurance, equality directives or other measures, we should ask ourselves what will be the impact of the legislation in terms of jobs.  Will it result in the Irish economy being more competitive and creating more jobs.  The jury is out in regard to this.<\/p><p>  The Government must be much more proactive in trying to drive down costs.  The income of every citizen of this country has been substantially reduced compared to their income three of four years ago.  Every worker, be he or she in the private sector or the public sector, is receiving less and yet the service providers employing some of those workers are not charging less on the whole.  I acknowledge that is a slightly sweeping statement.  We need to engage in a war against costs.  In the 1980s there was an active campaign to tackle inflation and it resulted, sometimes at painful costs excuse the pun, in reducing inflation from 20% to lower figures.  We have to tackle costs.  Perhaps it is the mentality of the Celtic tiger but we have not been challenging enough, be it of insurance companies, health providers or others, of the costs being imposed on the consumer.  I will not say that this decision is being forced upon us but the European institutions have made a judicial decision and we must live with it.  It will not benefit as far as I can gather male drivers, rather it will penalise female drivers.  They will pay more.  We have to look at the broader issue of how we can drive down the cost of insurance.  <\/p><p>  I welcome the legislation in the sense that it is a<i> fait accompli<\/i>.  From an equality perspective, perhaps it is correct decision in this wonderful world we are trying to create of having everything equal where everybody will be alike and think, talk, walk, work alike - the nirvana of equality.  However, in the practical world in which most of us live and from an economic perspective we must be more vigilant.  As a Government and an Oireachtas, we must be more proactive to drive down the cost of living for the very hard-pressed consumer.  I look forward to seeing how this legislation will work in practice.  We need to monitor the figures and statistics because we have given too much of a <i>carte blanche<\/i> to all service providers, be they insurance or other providers, during the past decade and the consumer is paying too much for too many things. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900022#V00200","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1355923500,"counter":263,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome although I cannot say the same for this legislation.  It is interesting to note that Ireland, the UK and Spain are the countries believed to be the ones that will be most affected by this ruling because gender-based pricing are most commonly used in them.  I would like to know if a cost analysis has been done of this.  It was interesting to hear the two previous speaker talk about costs.  How will this legislation affect the consumer?  I draw attention to the fact a think-tank called Open Europe last year estimated that on average a 17 year old female driver will now have to pay roughly an extra \u20ac5,000 in insurance premiums by the time she reaches the age of 26 and that is as a consequence of this ruling.  Unfortunately, in a general sense, there is too little consideration in legislative measures of the immediate effect of their provisions on citizens and businesses.  Has the Government come up with its own figures on this?<\/p><p>I broadly welcome the principle of not allowing companies to discriminate according to gender.  In a similar way, employers are not allowed to discriminate against women on the basis that they may have children and are more likely to take  leave for maternity purposes but not all women become pregnant, and in a similar fashion, not all men are high risk.  <\/p><p>On a broader level, I wonder if we can discriminate on the basis of age.  We recently discussed legislation in the Seanad on not forcing employees to retire at a certain age, on which Senator White expressed a strong view.  Does this mean that in principle the Europe Union finds gender discrimination wrong but age discrimination is okay?  That is an interesting question to consider.  Medical and insurance companies would have to massively change if a case regarding age discrimination came before the European Court of Justice.  <\/p><p>My first concern as somebody who has been involved in business is that, on paper, insurance companies will say that premiums will generally fall for young men and will rise for females.  The two previous speakers have also said that there is a danger that insurance companies will simply use the opportunity to raise the rates for females and keep the rates for young males the same.  The Minister of State said, &quot;The Central Bank, the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority each has specific statutory roles in promoting and protecting consumer interests&quot;, but I have grave doubts as to whether they will happen.  I believe it will be a win-win situation for the insurance companies.  How can we ensure that savings will be passed on to consumers?  Can the Minister of State comment on this type of monitoring or will the insurance companies be big winners in this?  I would like to know if the Financial Regulator, the Department of Transport, Tourism or Sport or even one of the multitude of quangos is planning to check whether the 25 year old will get a drop of \u20ac250 in his insurance premium or will he simply have to trust the insurance companies?<\/p> <p> I am very concerned that there are other underhand methods of profiling drivers.  Insurance companies use other statistics to find out the gender of a driver.  For instance, they may determine how many drivers of a particular type of car are women.  They may ask the percentage of nurses or primary school teachers who are female.  Such data will likely be used in what the insurance companies call \"profiling\".  Company car drivers are more likely to be male and could be charged more.<\/p><p>It has been suggested insurance companies may try to get around the rules by putting cars typically bought by young men in a higher insurance category which, in turn, would increase their premiums.  What is the Government planning in this regard?  Will the insurance companies effectively ignore the ruling, use their vast databases and come up with their own methods of identifying gender?  As anybody who makes an inquiry of an insurance company knows, rates vary widely and can drop dramatically when one says one intends to change insurance company.  The consumer is often not in a strong position if his or her insurance product which may be offered by only a handful of companies is one that he or she is legally compelled to buy.  There is no strong competition in the sector.<\/p><p>I would like to see an investigation into practices in the insurance industry, including cost of repair pricing.  It is common knowledge that there are two prices, one of which is charged for repairs commissioned by the insurance company.  This is sometimes twice the price charged to an individual who goes into a garage on his or her own to have a vehicle repaired.  When somebody dents the bumper of a two year old car, the insurance company will often state it is too uneconomical to repair and offer the consumer \u20ac100.  This is not to mention the struggles consumers face with certain insurance companies for an award if they make a claim.  The consumer would benefit greatly from a wide-ranging investigation into common practices in the insurance industry.  The consumer feels powerless to do anything.<\/p><p>An interesting and slightly philosophical point concerns the increase in bicycle use.  Should we consider a small premium for those who use their bicycles, especially those who commute?  After all, bicycle users are road users also.  Surely we should not discriminate against different road users.  According to the RSA, in 2010 five pedal cyclists were killed and 399 were injured in collisions.  Pedal cyclists constitute approximately 2% of all road fatalities.<\/p><p>Does the ruling mean that more young men will be able to start motoring at an earlier age?  Does this increase the risk of accidents occurring?  <\/p><p>Will the Minister comment on the position on pension annuities?  The decision of the European Court of Justice will also affect the cost of buying an annuity, an annual pension income, as women live longer than men and thus receive a smaller annual pension for the same pot of money.  Men will receive a smaller annuity income than they do now when their benefits are brought into line with those for women.  I am worried that this will lead to a lowering of pension incomes.  Will the Minister of State comment on this?  There is a clear difference in average life expectancy for men and women.  This change of circumstances could affect both sexes in different ways.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State confirm that insurance companies will in no way be able apply provisions of this ruling retrospectively to long-term policies such as life assurance policies?  This is to allay people's concerns completely on the matter.<\/p><p>I have asked many questions and hope we will have time to debate the matter fully.  I am aware that there is an earlier signature motion and that the Minister of State referred to the deadline of 21 December, but there are a number of questions we really need to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900022#V00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355924100,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for attending.<\/p><p>Like others, I welcome the Equal Status (Amendment) Bill.  It is not often we welcome a measure that could increase prices, at least for people like me, but I understand most of the price increases affecting women will affect younger women.  Once one is over the age of 40 or 45 years - sadly, I am in this age bracket \u2013 the price difference becomes much less significant.  Therefore, as Senator Feargal Quinn and others implied, price changes will occur at the bottom end of the market where there has been such a difference.  Senator Denis O'Donovan referred to the weighting for his son and younger men.<\/p><p>My understanding of the legislation is that insurance companies will continue to use gender but will not be able to base their decisions on gender alone.  Companies set up to sell insurance to women will not be able to say that because one is a woman, one's premium will be lower.  Although one's gender will be taken into account, other factors, including one's driving record, will also be taken into account.  Given that there is confusion, the Minister of State may be able to clarify the matter.  Insurance companies will not rule out the fact that an individual is a woman or a man, but they will have to regard that fact as just one factor in the mix in determining the rating of his or her insurance premium.<\/p><p>Drives for equality are always welcome, although they do draw attention to some complexities.  I concur with Senator Feargal Quinn on some of his queries on this matter.  I appreciate that the Competition Authority is set to put a mechanism in place to monitor the price change that is inevitable.  The difficulty it will face is that it will not be able to do so in the shorter term.  We will not be able to see trends emerging in the shorter term, unless insurance companies are very blatant about how they change their prices.  If they are more subtle and there is a focus on individual cases, it will take longer to work out whether prices are being increased simply because of this legislation.<\/p><p>I trust that the Competition Authority's mechanism is already properly developed and that we will not see big lags.  On 22 December, when the legislation will allow insurance companies to change their prices, we must not be left waiting for the Competition Authority.  We cannot wait until the middle of March, April or July for it to be up and running; it ought to be up and running straightaway.  The Department of Finance and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have stated they will organise a large-scale review, but this is dependent on the Competition Authority's monitoring of price changes.  Therefore, there is considerable opportunity for the slippage that nobody wants to see.  As various Members have said, we are more than aware of the need to try to contain costs at this time.  Senator Paul Bradford referred to this difficulty.<\/p><p>The next matter I wish to raise relates to health insurance.  I am not clear whether some health insurance premiums are weighted for women.  Since women live longer than men, will their insurance policies be more expensive?  If one is living longer, one is more inclined to be ill.  Is the Minister of State in a position to clarify the matter?<\/p><p>I concur with those Members who asked for a debate on the broader issues that arise.  We are here today to pass this legislation which we are forced to pass by the European Union.<\/p><p>Calls have been made in the United Kingdom for the use of black boxes.  Individual drivers could have their own black box, with which term we are familiar from aeroplanes.  With the black box, each driver would have a record of how he or she drove.  Just as personalised health products are coming down the tracks \u2013 drug companies are now much more capable of providing drugs tailored to people's needs \u2013 we will have personalised insurance products.  I suspect this is not as far off as it sounds.  Does the Government have plans to encourage, introduce or legislate for the use of black boxes?  Might having them result in greater equality?  It would not matter whether one was a man or woman; what would matter is how one drove.  That is at the heart of the matter, particularly where motor insurance is concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900023#W00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1355924100,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I oppose this Bill, as it is a load of nonsense.  The insurance market depends on the calculation of actuarial risk.  Women comprise a distinct group and carry a particular actuarial risk.  It is perfectly appropriate that insurance companies deal with them in that manner.  The same applies to young people, although it may be unfortunate for the good drivers within that group.  As that is how insurance works, this legislation is complete and utter nonsense.<\/p><p>The legislation is also contradictory.  The Minister of State indicated gender-specific insurance groups and we are catering for gender specificity in that regard.  This legislation derives from the European Union.  Just because it behaves in a nonsensical way, we are coerced into doing so.  This is direct rule by European Union.  I hope there will be a vote and look forward to voting against the Bill for the reasons outlined.  It is political correctness gone mad.<\/p> <p> On road safety, I commend Gay Byrne and Mr. Brett on the wonderful job they have done.  I sat in this House while the Senator next to me on the university benches derided Gay Byrne.  That was in a previous parliament.  Gay Byrne as done a wonderful job.  It may seem silly, but even on his Sunday radio programme he affects the consciousness of people on this issue.  He constantly reminds them of the issues.  It is wonderful our road fatality statistics have dropped as they have.  The crucial issue is that we must watch to ensure insurance premiums reduce, and we will be forced to do this by Europe.  It would not be appropriate that on the basis of a ruling such as this, insurance companies would make a profit.<\/p><p>When I saw the words &quot;equal status (amendment) in the title of this Bill, I thought this was good and that the Government was at last going to do something about the exemption of the churches in the operation of equality legislation.

Insurance premiums are based on risk factors.  In general, women receive lower premiums as there is a lower risk attached to women drivers.  Geographical location is a further risk assessment factor.  Insurance costs are much higher in some parts of this country than in others because a higher proportion of road traffic accidents take place in such locations.  There is for and against this.  I feel this policy can be quite punitive for some areas, but it is the reality.<\/p><p>We have concerns that the legislation will not result in lower insurance premiums for male drivers, but higher premiums for female drivers, as has been highlighted.  I note the Minister of State has alluded to the organisations that will look at this.  Is she happy the safeguards she has outlined will be sufficient.  If not, are there any steps the Government and the Department of Transport intend to take to ensure this does not transpire and that insurance companies do not take unfair advantage of this legislation?  This is pertinent when we consider what happened with the Bank of Ireland and credit cards.  We have seen much good will with regard to legislation passed in these Houses, where the banks and other institutions are supposed to do what they are told, but when it comes to the crunch that does not happen and the consumers end up paying.  I fear the same will happen with the insurance companies.  Despite all our good will and good intentions, insurance companies are there to make a profit, and they will do that.  I call on insurance companies to behave responsibly and to incentivise good driving.  Insurance companies in Britain offer discounts for young driver and safe driver schemes, through which premiums are reduced for both genders where there is a demonstrable record of safety over a period of time.  I hope insurance companies here will do the same.<\/p><p>I also take this opportunity to note recent commentary on the equal status Acts.  The Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, came before the Public Service Oversight and Petitions Committee recently, where she outlined a report she has laid before the Houses that shows the Minister for Health is blatantly in disregard of the equal status Acts.  I am concerned that if the Minister shows disregard for the equal status Acts, we can hardly expect insurance companies to take them seriously.  Will the Minister of State bring this issue to her Minister and will she tell us how she feels about the Ombudsman's report and what she had to say on these matters?  The Ombudsman said she could not imagine that a parliament would find this behaviour acceptable as implicit in the Minister's position, she was speaking about the Minister for Health, was an expectation that the public generally, and Oireachtas Members more specifically, would agree that his rejection of her recommendations was rational and reasonable.  She went on to say that on this approach, the law is optional and not binding.  We can decide when it suits us to obey the law and can disregard it where it is troublesome or inconvenient to abide by it.  I concur with her on that.<\/p><p>I would welcome the Minister of State's comment on this.  We need equal status and must ensure people are not discriminated against on a gender basis.  However, when it comes to legislation, we need the Government and Ministers to act as they would have others act.  They must respect Acts like the Equal Status Act.  The insurance companies should toe the line and the Government should hold them to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900024#X01700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355924700,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Norris is a silly Bill and I wonder what was the gender breakdown of the court that handed down the decision.  Why can a woman not be more like a man?  I certainly hope women cannot be more like men in the context of road safety, because their record is much better than that of men.<\/p>                                        O'Neill, Pat. <p>The model that seems to underpin the decision is that women achieved a form of dominance over the insurance industry and set out to charge men more but the opposite was the case.  Men dominated the industry.  They realised women were much safer drivers and rewarded them according to what their actuaries had worked out.  This is the kind of measure that gets the European Court of Justice a bad name in that when we attempt to reward good behaviour we are penalised.  It is silly.<\/p><p>I always welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I accept what she said at the end of her contribution about the Government having no option but to do this because of the European Court of Justice decision.  In the earlier debate the Minister for Health had no problem ignoring European court decisions but this Minister is right to adhere to it.  It is welcome that she has put the Central Bank in charge.  The Minister for Health appears to have difficulty in relying on it to regulate the insurance industry.<\/p><p>We can now look forward to more bogus equality decisions.  The markers of the leaving certificate always mark women much higher than men.  That is based on their abilities but it is unequal.  I have no doubt their learned lordships in Europe are working on that.  <\/p><p>The other person who must be brought in for punishment under this measure is the angel of death who is likely to call on the male Members of the House at least five years earlier than he will call on the Minister or Senators Keane and O'Keeffe.  <\/p><p>There is a great deal of daft equality stuff coming out of Europe, and this is part of it.  Those lower premiums rewarded people for safe driving and as Senator O'Donovan said, we have reduced the number of deaths on the road from 650 in the 1960s and the 1970s to 150 or 160 this year.  We have to get around the moral hazard problem and if their lordships in Europe have never heard of it, we ought to look askance at some of their decisions.  <\/p><p>This is a silly decision.

There are other factors that must continue to be taken into account, namely, one's record on road safety, whether one has a no claims bonus for ten years and so on.  We need to become blind to gender to a great extent.  There will be exceptions in some cases in terms of the maternity aspect, for instance, and the obvious issues that directly affect one gender or the other.

The normal cycle of social welfare legislation involves the enactment of at least two social welfare Bills per year.  One Bill is enacted in December each year to give effect to the various social welfare budget measures which are due to take effect from early in the following year.  A second Bill is enacted around spring or early summer to give effect to any other social welfare budget measures and to enact a range of other miscellaneous amendments to the social welfare code.  In order to distinguish the budget Bill from the spring or early summer Bill, the Bill enacted in December each year to give effect to the main social welfare budget measures is normally entitled the \"Social Welfare Bill\".<\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection is a very significant Department which will next year spend more than \u20ac20.2 million providing direct income supports to almost 4 million people in the population, one way or another.  &quot;Social welfare&quot; is the title that people use for the receipt of those payments so I do not fully fathom why Senator Cullinane would object to the Title.<\/p><p>With regard to his comments about Sinn F\u00e9in's desire for an amnesty, is he proposing that it would be the social welfare and amnesty Bill, to which I would have a grave objection?  Since I became Minister, Sinn F\u00e9in has been putting forward, for reasons it has never explained, proposals around a social welfare amnesty.  I believe people who are paying their PRSI, rather than seeing an amnesty, would like to see in regard to everybody who is required to pay PRSI, who was overpaid or who defrauds the social welfare system, that all of those moneys due to the social welfare system properly would be received so the money can be spent to the benefit of other people who rely on social welfare, in particular, pensioners.

The Senator expanded for a time on wanting to include in that discussion of \"Miscellaneous\" a broader perspective in regard to his party's discussion and frequent request for what is described as an amnesty.<\/p><p>I am not accepting Senator Cullinane's amendment.  There are two Bills a year, one relating to the budget, which is this Bill.  Social welfare covers 50 to 60 major payments and categories of individuals who receive those payments.

I am not inclined to accept his expansion of the Title and I am told by the Parliamentary Counsel there is no particular need of it.  For example, when we come to the spring-early summer Bill, the Title of that Bill in full depends on the particular contents of the Bill.<\/p> <p>If the Bill in the summer will also provide for amendments to the 1990 Pensions Act, the Title will also be amended to include a reference to being partly related to pensions.

Every year the Comptroller and Auditor General publishes the amounts of money outstanding to the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners which he, along with the Committee of Public Accounts, would like to see recovered.  This is a perfectly understandable part of public administrative policy.<\/p>                                                 \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, Labhr\u00e1s. <p>The arrears in regard to social welfare are just under \u20ac350 million.  About 60% of people who are in arrears are also in receipt of a social welfare payment.  The issue is covered in detail in section 13.  If somebody owes the Department \u20ac1,500, which is the average sum that is owed in quite a number of significant cases, it does not take much to do the maths to calculate how long it will take to recover \u20ac1,500 at \u20ac2 a week.  All we propose is that Department should be in a position to make those recoveries in a more timely fashion.  It is a cause of some scandal if people who have got away with money owed to the Department, some of it through fraud and abuse, repay it at \u20ac2 a week over a long number of years.  The repayment is simply to provide for the recovery of those amounts.  What could be achieved with the recovery of \u20ac350 million, or even half of \u20ac350 million, over a period of three or five years?  It would provide my Department with additional resources of somewhere between \u20ac20 million and \u20ac35 million to \u20ac40 million a year, which could be allocated to important areas such as paying pensioners.  I do not understand what problem is with this proposal.  As I said in my Second Stage speech, the proposal relates to an individual's personal individual payment; it does not affect the person's spouse, children or other dependants or any payments they or anybody else in the House may have.  I made that very clear yesterday. <\/p><p>On the question of whether the staff in the Department of Social Protection take into the account the circumstances of the individual and the circumstances of the over-payment, I gave that undertaking in my speech yesterday.  On the question of whether we should recover the overpayments, we should absolutely, because they will provide much needed resources, which all the Members of the House would be concerned to ensure would be devoted to social protection and to people who are entitled to social protection payments.  That is what the proposal is about.  The requirement in this respect and a discussion on it takes place annually at the Committee of Public Accounts and it appears annually in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, should the social protection committee wish to discuss it, I am sure that if a member of the Senator's party is on that committee, he or she could raise the matter with the chairperson and it would be a matter for the committee and the chairperson to decide if they wish to discuss it further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900030#DD03000","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355928000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I would like to ask the Minister a simple question.

The media in general report on such cases.  Once a decision is made to proceed with the potential of a prosecution being made, the matter passes out of the hands of the Department and is administered by the State's prosecution service.  In recent years the Judiciary has taken a very serious view of any fraud or abuse of the social welfare system.  Such cases are reported regularly and extensively in the media.  There has been a significant increase in cases and in some of them, particularly those that involve fake multiple identities, which unfortunately has become an issue of abuse in the social welfare system, penalties have been imposed, including jail time.  The courts have taken a very serious view of such abuse but the detailed prosecution of the individual is a matter ultimately for the prosecution service.<\/p><p>The special investigations unit of the Department of Social Protection has set up a series of special programmes, the detail of which I will not go into now, to target serious areas of fraud, including people who steal and adopt identities and use them to abuse or defraud the social welfare system.  That is not a matter for today in the context of this Bill.  If the Senator wishes, at a future stage in the Seanad we can go into the details of the anti-fraud special investigations unit of the Department, which works with other agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and customs to ensure that persons suspected of social welfare fraud are pursued and that the fraud is stopped.  If the amounts of money involved are of a serious nature, those matters are taken to the prosecution authorities and they make a decision whether to go ahead and prosecute.  The Senator will be aware that some very severe sentences have been handed down to people who adopted multiple identity frauds resulting in very significant losses to the Department.  This would be a person who has collected benefits in the name of a person who is dead or who has stolen other people's identities and built up an amount collected from the benefits over a number of years.  As the Senator can imagine, that would result in a very significant loss of money to the Department.  <\/p><p>Our proposal is that in such a case recovering those moneys at \u20ac2 a week does not send out a serious message.  The provisions with which we will deal in section 13 provide for the moneys to be recovered at a moderate amount of up to 15% of the principal payment.  It does not affect the person's children or other dependants.  This would result in significant recovery of moneys for the Department over a period a time.  When overpayments come to light in the future, we will be in a position to initiate recovery of more serious sums from the time the overpayment was discovered, bearing in mind that the social welfare officials will have due regard to the position of the individual and the circumstances which gave rise to the overpayment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900031#EE00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1355928000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>That comment was probably more appropriate to the later section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900031#EE00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1355928000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>A Leas-Chathaoirligh-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900031#EE00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1355928000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I allowed the Senator in on this issue and I should not have done so.

Given what we have been talking about and the importance of that issue, what day does the Minister envisage those sections will be commenced and would there be different commencement dates for section 13 which deals with the issue of the recovery of overpayments, as against the other sections which deal with very different matters?<\/p><p>I thought the Minister's answer to Senator Mooney's question was very comprehensive.  As my party's justice spokesperson, I would like us to have a debate in this House on the particular issue the Senator raised on a different day concerning the issue of prosecutions for fraud in this area.  That is something that has changed, developed and we have seen a great increase in the number of prosecutions recently.

Certain sections require or specify a date on which the provisions of that section come into operation.  For example, section 10, which relates to the minimum contribution payable by self-employed contributors, specifies that this measure will take place from 1 January 2013.  Where no specific commencement date is provided for in the relevant section of the Bill and where that provision is not to be brought into force by way of a commencement order in accordance with section 1(4), that provision of the Bill will come into effect on the enactment of the Bill, and obviously that will require the President's signature after the passage of the Bill.<\/p> <p>That is the case, for instance, with the provisions of section 3 which relate to the calculation of the yearly average and alternative yearly average for State pension purposes.<\/p><p>The purpose of a commencement order is to provide an element of flexibility regarding the timing of when a particular provision of the Bill is to be commenced.  This allows for the necessary administrative work to be undertaken to facilitate the introduction of the particular measure.  As a commencement order made in accordance with section 1(4) is merely bringing particular provisions contained in the Bill that have already been approved by both the D\u00e1il and the Seanad into force from a specific date, it would be inappropriate for such orders to have to be approved once again by the Oireachtas.  <\/p><p>The specific proposal being made was that such orders would require to be approved by a committee of the Oireachtas.  This would in effect give a committee of the Oireachtas the power to overrule the will of the Oireachtas.  That is why I said if people want discussions on certain matters they can take them to the relevant committee and the relevant committee can decide to discuss them but the committee does not have power of legislation.  As I have said, I do not believe that is necessary or appropriate and for the same reason I do not consider it appropriate for drafts of such an order to have to be debated by a committee of the Oireachtas before it could be made but it is open to the Oireachtas committee on education and social protection to debate the implications of such an order once it has been made.<\/p><p>Conversely, I would point out that in last year's Bill, for instance, which was the subject of much discussion here among the Senators, there was the age in regard to lone parents.  That comes into effect on 1 January next.  If the Bill is passed, including the proposal before the House in the relevant section towards the end of the Bill, that date will be brought forward next year and every other year to the beginning of July.  However, if the Bill is not passed last year's Act stands and the ageing out process in regard to approximately 1,000 lone parents begins in January and every January thereafter, as opposed to the proposal in the Bill to amend that and change it to July to facilitate interviews for lone parents who are ageing out and to facilitate opportunities around training and education for lone parents whose children are older and who, as we discussed last year, are settled in school.  I hope that clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900031#EE01500","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355928600,"counter":414,"content":"<p>Specifically-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900032#FF00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1355928600,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I remind the Senator that we have spent 40 minutes on the first section.

Our amendments were ruled out of order but we wanted to include in this section the retention of the back to school clothing and footwear payment which has been cut.  As the Minister is aware, many families are dependent on this very important allowance.  It ensures that families either in poverty or barely struggling to survive have some means of support to buy school uniforms, clothes and get their children to primary and secondary school.  It is wrong that we do not have an opportunity to properly scrutinise that cut which the Minister is making.  It is something that will be made by her, as Minister, and not by legislators, especially people who made promises on these issues, but the payments are very important to those families.  It is not just about the \u20ac50 cut this year; it was cut by \u20ac50 last year.<\/p><p>The Minister might clarify the comments she made to the effect that people should shop around and get value for money.  I know many families who have to buy their school uniforms in certain shops because only certain shops stock their school uniforms.  They do not have the luxury of shopping around and even if families do shop around, school uniforms have a certain cost, as do school books, footwear and so on.  If we want to genuinely cherish free education to make sure that families are properly supported, we must ensure that the supports are in place.  <\/p><p>This is one of the cruel cuts in this budget that will also impact on many families.  It would have been better if the Minister had included this social welfare cut, and it is a social welfare cut, in this section of the Social Welfare Bill to allow us, as legislators, an opportunity to properly scrutinise it and make decisions on it.  I wonder if some of these cuts were left out because they might be very difficult decisions for people to have to make by way of voting for them.  That would be a cynical move if it were the case but I take the opportunity to register my personal disgust, on behalf of the many families I represent who have e-mailed me, to whom I have spoken and who have been in contact with me who are scandalised by many of the cuts in the social welfare budget but who have been very upset by this cut also because of the impact it will have on the ability of many families to be able to pay for school books, footwear and the school uniforms they need to pay for when it comes to the time for their children to return to school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900032#FF01700","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1355928600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I will refrain from saying anything about the claw-back of overpayments but I hope we will reach that section because in the D\u00e1il-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900032#FF01800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1355928600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>That is section 13.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900032#FF01900","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1355928600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I know it is section 13.

It is very welcome to be part of this very detailed debate on these points.<\/p><p>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance provides a one-off payment to eligible families.  It is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but to provide assistance towards such costs.  As the bulk of families in receipt of the payment are also in receipt of social welfare payments, the Senator will know they receive \u20ac30 per week per child.  The Senator will also know that in addition to what they receive currently, they will receive next year \u20ac130 per month per child.  I make the point in case the Senator is implying that the State does not make other payments to children who are members of families in receipt of social welfare.  The State makes extensive payments.  If children have a special need, they may also be in receipt of other payments such as the domiciliary care allowance.  The State makes, as is proper, an extensive range of payments to children, including additional payments to children with special needs.  Approximately \u20ac63 million was spent on the scheme in 2012 on 185,000 families, including well over 250,000 children.  Budget 2013 provides for a reduction in the rate of back to school clothing and footwear allowance from \u20ac150 to \u20ac100 for children aged between four and 11 years and from \u20ac250 to \u20ac200 for children aged 12 years or more.  The proposed rates for 2013 are not intended to meet the full costs for children returning to school but to assist them while there are other significant payments made to parents and from which more than 250,000 children benefitted this year.<\/p><p>The rates of back to school clothing---<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900033#GG01200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>We are on section 3, Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900033#GG01300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I am replying to a Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900033#GG01400","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I ruled that out of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900033#GG01500","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929200,"counter":462,"content":"<p>Senator Cullinane made statements which failed to reflect the full extent of the social welfare payments made in respect of children.

I am happy to have provided in the budget for additional funds for hot-meal services in schools which are very important.  I admit to have taken funds from direct cash payments to provide for services to children in school.  The underlying issue in the debate on social welfare is the correct balance between cash payments to people who rely on social welfare for their income and the provision of services by the State.  During the boom years, we concentrated largely on increasing cash payments and in many ways failed to expand service provision which is often most important to families with children.  I ask Senators to consider the budget in the round and to look at the expansion of programmes and the funding provided for after-school care services and special projects for children in disadvantaged areas as well as the additional funding provided for hot school breakfasts.  I understand that the Senator is making a debating point, but this is a very serious Chamber and I ask him to consider the social welfare budget in its totality.  While there is pressure on the social welfare budget at a time of unprecedented economic difficulty, we are trying to be innovative by putting more services in place where we can be sure children will benefit.  The expansion of the programme of hot school meals represents such a service as do measures for children in very disadvantaged areas.  We are also providing more than 6,000 additional after-school child care places and, as discussed yesterday, 10,000 additional places for services and community employment.  The budget should be viewed in context as reformatory and as striking a balance between service provision and direct cash payments.  Most parties in the House will agree that we got the balance wrong in the boom years with an excessive focus on direct cash as opposed to the delivery of services.  That was not only the case in the case of social welfare but across a range of services provided by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900033#GG01800","speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355929200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.\r\nSECTION 4  Question proposed: &quot;That section 4 stand part of the Bill&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929200,"counter":466,"content":"<p>Section 4 goes right to the heart of the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900033#GG02000","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1355929200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Keep it relevant, Senator.

This goes to the heart of the issue of forcing legislation through without proper scrutiny.  We raised issues on the subject matter of section 4 last year.  Section 4 deals with pension contributions.  The issues I wish to discuss arise from legislation passed in 1997 which provided that the number of contributions required was to be doubled from 260 to 520.  Last year's budget gave effect to that provision and the legislation passed in its wake sought to apply the measure to everyone from April 2012.  We objected to that at the time and were lobbied by a number of individuals who were fast approaching retirement only to discover their pension entitlement would be a fraction of what they had expected.  It affected the women particularly.<\/p><p>The legislation overlooked certain categories of people.  Our figures show that 540 people managed to qualify for a pension with only 260 contributions.  Changes are now being made to correct that, the reason being that we rushed through the legislation last year as we are again this year.  This is important because it reinforces the argument we would all make that we need proper scrutiny of legislation passing through the House.  We should not force the Social Welfare Bill through simply to get it done before the end of the year.  We must allow sufficient time for both the Upper and Lower Houses to scrutinise the legislation properly.<\/p> <p>It appears that we missed a category of people last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900033#GG02200","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355929800,"counter":470,"content":"<p>The Senator has made his point.

A cornerstone of our social welfare system is a very important and significant contributory old age pension which can be funded only if the people who wish to benefit from it contribute enough to meet the promises that the Government has made.  There are an increasing number of people who survive not only to claim their pensions but to live for a very long time.  That is a great demographic bonus for this country as is the number of children in the country.  It does cost significantly more to fund pensions for the increasing number of people claiming contributory and non-contributory old age pensions.  This year and next year the social welfare Estimate will provide for an additional \u20ac200 million to \u20ac300 million in funds to cover the increase in the older population and the fact that those people are living longer.<\/p><p>The second part of our system, which is probably one of its best parts, is the non-contributory pension.  If for some reason a person has made limited contributions or none to a contributory pension and has limited or insufficient means, that person can claim a non-contributory pension whose rate is pretty close to that of the contributory pension.  I can assure the Senator that his suggestion, which implied that many people, particularly women, will suddenly be left without an old age pension is wrong.  There will of course be people whose contributions have been insufficient so they will receive a partial pension assessed in terms of contributions, as they would always have done.

The Oireachtas agreed to one of the changes in the early 2000s.  The second set of changes has come into effect now.

The good thing about the Irish system, and this is a tribute to successive Governments, is not only do we have a contributory system but we also have a strong non-contributory system which provides that anybody who has made insufficient contributions or, in some cases, for various reasons, has not contributed to the system, is in a position, on a means-tested basis, to claim a very significant non-contributory old age pension.  I put it to Senator Cullinane that if he were to compare the pension provision for older people in the Republic with that in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland he would find that under successive Governments, the Irish State and taxpayer have been as strong and as generous as possible in the context of the State's means.

We have had skirmishes for the past hour and ten minutes but this is the beginning of the discussion on the heart of this Bill.  I could not help but reflect that it is coming from a party that for many years in opposition lectured this party on fairness and equity.  It reminds me of the late lamented Frank Hall who on \"Hall's Pictorial Weekly\" in the 1970s created a character called the Minister for Hardship.  We could call the Departments of the gang of five Labour Party Ministers Departments of Hardship because what they are doing to the most vulnerable is ironic.  Theirs was the party that for a number of years took the high moral ground saying that if it had the opportunity to be in government it would be better than the other side.<\/p> <p>They promised specifically not to do certain things.  They suggested that in government they would protect the vulnerable.  They would ensure the dastardly people in the Fine Gael Party would not introduce subtle cuts that would affect the most vulnerable, whom they see as the larger part of their constituency.  Look at what has happened.  In every Department with a Labour Party Minister, and I include Iveagh House - although as far as I am aware the only cut the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade made was to shut down the Irish embassy in the Vatican - in the Departments of Education and Skills, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and Social Protection we have seen cut after cut.<\/p><p>The Minister will be aware that in the past week the IMF which has been monitoring the economic progress of the country and helped in the bailout programme has said one needs to question the austerity measures.  In the United States, the hardline neo-conservative Republicans agree that austerity has gone far enough and are now willing to see that the upper echelons of wealthy Americans pay more.  The Minister had the opportunity to provide a viable alternative that would have prevented this cut of \u20ac26 million.  A survey was carried out in 2006 - and perhaps there is a need for an updated survey as times have changed - in which 2,000 carers were surveyed and the conclusion was that one in four used the grant, which was then \u20ac1,200, for other things such as basic foodstuffs, heating and lighting.  That was in the boom times.  Consider the stories of anguish and torment that are being experienced by families who are relying to a large extent on the money from the Department of Social Protection.  Most of those in receipt of the respite grant get it from the Department of Social Protection.  How can the Minister stand over these cuts, when one considers her background?  She should be ashamed of herself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900034#HH02100","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355930400,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I had the privilege of following the Minister on the hustings in 2011.

I wish to make a few simple points on the respite care allowance.<\/p><p>In the first paragraph of her speech, the Minister states one of her priorities is &quot;that those in most need of the assistance are protected....&quot;.   In 2013, \u20ac775 million will be spent &quot;to support carers&quot;.  It is wonderful.  &quot;Protection&quot; is a great word, but the Minister has an unique way of defining it.  Who are we really protecting?  We are protecting the big boys with a lot of money, the Vegas bagmen banks and the &quot;cleaner uppers&quot; of the Vegas bagmen banks.  We gave \u20ac3,750 million to the Bank of Ireland.  We gave \u20ac3,750 million to AIB.  We gave \u20ac52,000 million to garbage known as &quot;Anglo Irish Bank&quot;.

We are living in Ireland and we should be changing the things that our own people, the Irish need to have changed.  We should not be copying, good or bad with respect to Senator Quinn, what happens elsewhere.  The idea of comparison is useless, whether it is positive or negative.

The Minister must make the decision and the Government must take the repercussions for the limiting decision it is making on respite allowance.<\/p><p>Nobody, neither Senator, Minister or Government has the monopoly on the right thing to do, the hard and unpalatable thing to do, nor do they have the monopoly on the right reasons.  The Government has the monopoly in this House on bad decisions.  Bad choices are disguised as protection.<\/p><p>My final point is that the Minister told us yesterday that if the Bill were to be paused for 90 days, the loss in respect of social welfare would be \u20ac124 million.  This money would have to be made up from her own budget.  That may be true, but it is no reason for this House to falter.  We are a country that spent most of our time making decisions based on fear.  The Seanad is no place for this to happen again.  Fear is the last place we should go when we are being asked to make a decision.<\/p><p>I will finish with these questions.  Where is the Government's honour?  That was the great question that the Greeks asked.  Where is the empowerment, recognition and support promised to carers?  Where are the Government strategies that promised access to respite breaks?  Where are the Government's commitments to the national carers' strategy?  The argument made by Government that the basic carer's allowance or the core income was not touched can be translated to carers as follows, &quot;One can only have a moment in the sun and you need to be grateful for that.&quot;  There are many people on very high allowances and salaries, which can be translated as, &quot;You can still have every moment in the sun and live without fear of clouds and have the expectation of increases.&quot;  The Minister must find \u20ac26 million elsewhere to sustain the carer's respite grant.

I spoke on Second Stage yesterday.  The 20% cut in respite care is a significant cut, and one would be hard put to find another cut of that magnitude in the budget.  Some 77,000 families receive this payment.  I further remind colleagues that this is the only payment some 5,000 families receive.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, said that one could stay in a fine hotel for \u20ac700 a week and get a break.  That is an outrageous comment.  I have met both carers and those who are cared for and the Minister and I know what the money is used for.  I believe the Minister knows that this proposed cut is wrong.  The Government has made a mistake.  Nobody is right all the time.  Since the announcement of the proposed cuts I have spoken to many people.  People have different views on child benefit, some think it should be taxed, others think it should be means tested, while another group think it should be a universal payment.  However, I have met nobody, neither a member of the general public nor a constituent, and certainly none of the Minister's constituents in Dublin West, who agree that the respite care grant should be cut by 20%.  These are some of the most vulnerable people in the country.  If one tried to pick a cohort of people, one would be hard pressed to find a more vulnerable group.  I have met nobody who has told me this cut is correct.  I do not believe the Minister thinks it is right.  I do not think any of the Senators on the Government side believe this cut is right.  I may be convinced further down the line on things that may happen to child benefit and I am open to it.  I welcomed the Minister's suggestion yesterday of publishing the report on child benefit and discussing it in the Chamber.  Mr. Paddy Doyle is in the Visitor's Gallery and I met him and his friends.  They will tell the Minister what the respite care grant means to them.

That is the reason I implore colleagues to reject this section and return it to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.  We should respectfully state the Members have got it wrong and that \u20ac26 million can be raised in another way.  Imposing an additional 3% on those earning more than \u20ac100,000 would raise \u20ac200 million.  Where is the fairness?

Carers become stressed and may get sick when they are not cared for.  Do we want them to spend their days in hospital, as Senator John Crown asked last night?  If even 10% of carers or carees were to spend one day a year in hospital, the Minister would see the costs involved.<\/p><p>Does the troika detail to the Minister what needs to be cut from social welfare payments?  My take on the memorandum of understanding is that any new measure of equal value can be substituted or brought forward to make savings in the national budget.  Will the Minister clarify this for all Government Senators?  Most of the Government Senators to whom I have spoken are certain that it must be cut from the budget of the Department of Social Protection.  The money does not have to come from social welfare payments; I have ten ideas on where we could save money and I am willing to meet anybody to discuss them.<\/p><p>The Minister states that if we pause the passage of the Bill, it will cost \u20ac124 million.  I am open to correction, but the respite care grant is not due to be paid until June 2013.  I plead, at the very least, for a stay of execution.

It is the responsibility of the Minister and Government Senators to do the right thing by carers.  I have received many e-mails from people who care for children, those with profound disabilities and older people.  Some, although not all, are in receipt of a payment, but they genuinely depend on the respite care grant.  They are distraught at the prospect of losing &#8364;325 a year which comes on top of all the other cuts which will impact on them.  I am sure every Senator has received telephone calls on this issue.  I work closely with the Carers Association in Waterford and know about the difficult, demanding but loving and caring job that caring is.  People value what they do.  They are looking after their spouse, mother or father or sons and daughters and people with profound disabilities.  They look to the State to ensure they are properly protected, as they cannot defend themselves.  They cannot go out to work.  It is not by choice but the consequence of an accident, illness or disability that they must care for the person concerned.  They do it because they love the person for whom they are caring, but they need support.  I know the Minister knows that they need this support.<\/p><p>  The Carers Association estimates that 77,000 carers receive the respite care grant.  Of this number, about 5,000 do not receive any other payment whatsoever.  It is also important to point to other provisions in the budget that will impact on carers: there is a 32% cut in the housing adaptation grants scheme to remediate houses to facilitate people with a disability; there is a threefold hike in prescription charges for medical card holders; there are changes to the drug repayment scheme and cuts to the household benefits package.  We should also acknowledge that the previous Government cut the weekly rate of carer's allowance and the household benefits package, as did the Minister this year and last year.  The financial supports for those with special dietary requirements have been cut also.  All of these cuts impact on people with disabilities and their carers.  Social Inclusion Ireland was very clear that this was a regressive move.  <\/p><p>  I wish to read an e-mail I received.  It states:<ul>As a mother of three children, one of whom has autism, I implore you to vote against this Bill.  I have been at every protest mounted by the Carers Association since the publication of this budget.  I have been at odds with many of my fellow carers because I felt it would take a supreme effort to get feet on the street and have strength in numbers.  I can assure you that the low turnout was not due to apathy or laziness, it was because we had no one to hand over the reins to.  There is no holiday or lunch time cover in the caring vocation.  Plenty of overtime all right but all of it is unpaid.  Before I became a mother to a son with autism, I was a granddaughter to a lady with dementia and I have cared in one capacity or another since I was ten years of age.  I can assure you it was not my intended career path.  I did not pursue a BA and H.Dip in order to become a carer.  In fact I gave up my job only last year because the system was failing my son so badly that I had to give him my all.  <\/ul>The mother in question goes on to outline how this cut will impact on her.  I have received many similar e-mails from carers.<\/p><p>  I have a copy of the ESRI preliminary report on the budget which must make for very grim reading for the Labour Party.  It points to the impact on people in various income brackets.

I have listened to the leader of the Labour Party saying to people who may vote with their conscience, who may vote on what they stand for, that they will be expelled from the Labour Party.  That is shocking for democracy.  They should stand by the people who voted for them.  They should stand by the carers of Ireland.  They should stand by those people who need to be protected, people whom the Minister promised she would protect.  She has failed absolutely to do so.  It is not too late for her to change her mind.  There are any number of options that any of us could provide to the Minister for finding the \u20ac26 million.  She will have the support of this House if she does it.  The Minister climbed down and reversed decisions in many instances last year.  She will have the collective strength and support of this House if she makes the right call on this issue and if she withdraws the cut to the respite care grants; if she ensures that all those families whom we all know and represent, are given the proper care supports that they give to the people they care for and if carers are given the same level of support from this State they had to enable them to do the job they do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900036#KK01100","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355931600,"counter":505,"content":"<p>Yesterday I spoke in the House in what I think was in a balanced and fair way.  I paid tribute to the Minister for her courageous and valiant battle in reducing the scale of the cuts overall.  It is important that we place these matters on the record of the House.  I spoke passionately and with emotion.  I placed on the record of the House the extent of the pain reflected in the very many e-mails I have received.  I believe it is important that at the very least, we should act in Seanad \u00c9ireann as witnesses of an agony unparalleled in my experience of 25 years in the Seanad.<\/p><p>I do not propose to artificially resurrect the passion of yesterday.  Now is the moment for making clear and clinical decisions.  These decisions are about the welfare of the people of Ireland and they are, therefore, of extraordinary importance.  Seanad \u00c9ireann stands as a last bulwark against injustice of a beleaguered people.  The Minister recognised this fact because she says she does not wish to inflict this pain on the people.  <\/p><p>I refer to her speech where she stated that she does not want to cut child benefit, respite care grant or the duration of jobseeker's allowance.  I say to her then she should not do so.  This House is constitutionally charged with the responsibility of not just revising legislation; we have the constitutional requirement to respectfully send back legislation for reflection by the Government for a period of 90 days maximum.  It could be done in a much shorter period of time so the expense need not be the full 90 days.<\/p><p>The money can be found elsewhere quite easily from the people who are advantaged, as opposed to the disadvantaged.  One very obvious and simple measure that has been remarked on - I am not claiming any originality - is the fact that people in the public service are still in receipt of increments.  There is something obscene about paring away a minimal benefit from the disadvantaged while simultaneously there is the spectacle of the advantaged increasing their advantage.  I cannot find any justification for people receiving wage increases.  I can see some reason for saying that people have an argument to be allowed to retain in so far as possible the income they have because they have made commitments and so on.  However, only a foolish person or a foolish Government makes provision in advance of receipt of the moneys.<\/p><p>The Minister has stated that the social welfare system has proven highly effective at preserving a threshold of decency for those most in need of support.  Where now is that threshold of decency?  It is just words, inert, on a page.  We need to give them action.  I sympathise with the Minister and I think she is a brave, courageous Minister.  However, where is the social protection?  Are people being protected?  It reminds me of that awful period when the United Nations declared safe havens in Bosnia and people were massacred within them.  Still they were safe havens and everyone could feel comfortable.  <\/p><p>There is a political point here.  I have been very proud to have been a Member of this House for 25 years.  I would be ashamed if we do not send this Bill back to the Government.  I believe we would be acting in defiance of the responsibility with which the House is charged.  This would add, paradoxically, an argument to the Taoiseach's desire to abolish this House.  If we fail to register our disapproval of this cut, then there is no reason for us to be here; we would become just a rubber stamp.  We have the opportunity now, uniquely, to demonstrate that we have relevance to the people and that there are people of conscience in the political party system.  I am privileged to stand outside it.  I salute my colleagues who have been nominated by the Taoiseach because that confers an obligation on them.  I am sure they feel an obligation yet they have rejected that very human emotion in the interests of the people.  For that reason I am very glad that they were so appointed.<\/p><p>This Seanad may well be at the end of its life; I do not know.  Nor do I know what the people's view is.  The people would like to see politicians humiliated, got rid of.  They would like to see the Seanad closed because they would like to see 60 politicians lose their jobs.  I am sure they feel the same way about the other House.  I have no doubt it is quite a possibility that the people would decide: &quot;Yes, they are just politicians, get rid of them.  They haven't earned our respect, our trust.  They haven't earned the right to continue in operation.&quot;  If we push this issue and if we reject this section of the Bill and require the Government to reconsider it over a period of up to 90 days, then it may well be that if the Taoiseach seeks to punish Seanad \u00c9ireann for its temerity-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900037#LL00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1355931600,"counter":506,"content":"<p>We are dealing with section 5 of the Bill, Senator Norris.

The question is why were they targeted?  Carers make a contribution, the value of which has doubled since 2006 when it was \u20ac2.5 billion.  Some 900,000 hours of caring are given every day and the value of that is equivalent to a third of the total annual cost of the HSE.  Why were carers targeted for the largest cut?  That is a fundamental unfairness in the budget.  The Seanad is called upon today to ask the Government to halt and think again.<\/p><p>Why was this specific cut included in the budget given that the health Estimate for next year includes a figure \u20ac550 million, which is completely nebulously described as savings from Croke Park?  It seems that in the budget the Government had to say it was taking this amount off carers.  There is a fundamental dishonesty at the heart of the Government in that when its members talk about the fairness of the budget and in aiming to prove that fairness they must refer to Fianna F\u00e1il budgets going back to 2008 and to tax measures which do not come into effect until 2014.  <\/p><p>Why is this cut coming into effect now, hurting the most vulnerable, caring and decent people in society when some of the tax measures which will slightly offset the unfairness of the budget will not come into effect for at least 12 months?

I know the Minister is a caring person.  I also know she is not an unthoughtful person.  In the big spectrum of contemporary politicians she would be from a tradition that puts some thought and - to use what is considered a bad word but it should not be - \"ideological\" inspiration into how she acts.  I am not being critical of anyone, it is just the way history has evolved here over the past 90 odd years; there was a certain amount of flip-flopping, especially in times of recession, and parties that are in government get the task of cutting and parties that are in opposition get the task of being suffused with umbrage.  That is the way it is.  No matter which side of the House one is on, depending on which part of the job one has at a particular time in history, it is always a little galling to hear the other group express their umbrage and hold one personally to blame.<\/p><\/a> <p>In the trajectory of the history of our republic, we have plenty of blame to be shared.  Every penny the Minister has to cut is associated with hardship for the person in receipt of it and, in the case of the every penny the Minister spends, it is hardship for the person whose opportunity cost is not met by spending it elsewhere.  There is a finite amount of money to go around and the Minister has been dealt a terrible deck of cards.  She found herself coming into a caring ministry at a time when demand for services underwent a sudden, dramatic and nearly unprecedented increase, which coincided with an unprecedented decline, even in international terms, in the revenue base from which she operates.  This is an extraordinary situation and cannot be met easily.  It is like trying to keep afloat in a perfect storm while clutching at the straw that, at some point in the future, we will get a renegotiation of bank debt.<\/p><p>It is a special case and I have had multiple representations made to me by people across the social spectrum, from well-off people, those who are not, and those who are looking after an elderly relative or a young child facing no future.  Most of us who are parents know what it is like to have a helpless young child whose nappy needs to be changed and who needs to be hand fed.  I am not preaching to the Minister because she knows this.  In the case of many of the people we are talking about, the phase of nappies and hand feeding never ends.  It goes on not for two or three years but for 30 or 40 years.  The frustration of trying to deal with people who cannot communicate because they cannot speak, which will end in the case of normal children when they reach three or four years of age and start making their own opinions well known, will not end in the case of many of these folks.<\/p><p>As a doctor, I do not deal with those kinds of patients but I deal with cancer patients who may be in the final stages of their lives.  I see them for an intense exposure of ten to 15 minutes and then I move on.  They do not move on and the person who is with them, who I am talking to about tablets, pills and the necessity to turn up for tests or scans, does not move on either.  That is their life sentence until the life ends.  This is a special case but there are many special cases.<\/p><p>I hinted at this point yesterday in our short exchange and I hope to amplify the point today.  The Minister did not do this because she is unkind, because I know she is not unkind.  She did not do it because she is unthoughtful, because I know she is not unthoughtful.  When she thinks more about the economic implications of the measure, a case can be made that this may not save the money she thinks.  People talk about not receiving the carer's allowance driving them into illness, which is theoretical but could potentially happen.  What does happen on a daily basis is that when we in the hospital try to discharge someone with cancer or another chronic illness, we find that we do not have good stepdown facilities.  We do not have convalescent homes and other facilities.  Very often, someone stays in hospital for one, two or three days more because the carer is not ready for the person to come home.  Provisions are not in place.  A family told me they were at the end of their rope because they had another sick relative at home taking up all of their attention.  Every time it happens, it costs the Exchequer between \u20ac500 and \u20ac1,000 for the patient's inpatient day.<\/p><p>I will make some suggestions about where the money could be found.  I hinted at it yesterday.  The Minister should discontinue every public relations contract in the public service.  No public servant needs a PR contract.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900038#MM03000","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355932800,"counter":552,"content":"<\/a> <p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900039#NN00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1355932800,"counter":553,"content":"<\/a> <p>Every public servant and every Minister should speak for themselves.  Every chief executive officer in a Department in the Civil Service should be given the job in rotation once a week of taking a press conference and answering questions unspun.  We should end mandatory retirement so that people who wish to continue working do not become dependent on the State.  We should have a once-off Celtic tiger windfall tax for people who made large profits on real estate during the boom years.  We hear all the hard stories about people wiped out by the boom years but an awful lot of people made money.  I am not a fan of wealth taxes because people should pay tax once on the money they have but this is a national emergency.<\/p><p>People like me, who have large incomes of hundreds of thousands of euro, should be charged more income tax.  It is not widely known but Irish consultants, uniquely, had a 4% increase in income tax last week.  None of us is complaining about it and I would be happy if the Minister added 1% more to get rid of measures such as this.  The Minister should also fire a few quangos and allow for early redemption of the \u20ac100 billion in pension assets largely held outside the State.  There is a tax incentive for the assets to remain outside the State when people often desperately need the money.  They cannot wait to retire because they may lose their homes to negative equity or their business to a failure of credit from the banks.  There are many measures that can be taken.

The Minister for Social Protection and other Ministers who have been to the House have argued that we will require substantive debate weeks and months in advance of next year's budget.  I spent many years in opposition and know the role of the Opposition is to say \"No\" when the Government says \"Yes\".  If the Government brings forward difficult proposals, such as that on the carer's allowance, we need the Opposition not only to say \"No\" but also to highlight what it would do instead.  It is much too easy simply to say \"No\", that cuts are bad and that one is in favour only of good measures.  I would like the Opposition to have the opportunity to put on the record where it would find the money.  When we all calm down a little and try to put in place structures for next year and thereafter, we will certainly need to change our budgetary structure.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the extremely difficult position in which the Minister finds herself.  There is no point in talking history because the public is concerned about today and tomorrow, not yesterday.  It is important to acknowledge that the role played by carers is of great economic and social significance.  We have made progress on nursing homes and subventions but we must value carers.  Every carer is not only providing care but also making a significant statement about values in this country.<\/p> <p>Carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant have genuinely made a difference.  If the Cathaloirleach checks the record, he will see that nobody in this House has spoken more about carers and the need for a new carer's strategy than me.  I am not standing up at the last minute to comment because my record speaks for itself.  Great changes need to be made to the system, the means test, guidelines and regulations, as I have stated previously.  I appreciate why the Minister has had to take this distasteful measure, but how do we proceed?  Notwithstanding what some of my colleagues have said, it is vital to put a new system in place to debate the options.  Announcing the budget on a Wednesday, to be followed by the Social Welfare Bill on a Thursday, may have been sufficient in the Ireland and the political system of old, but the system is not fit for purpose in the new structure and society we are trying to build.  Can we learn anything in this difficult situation?  At least let us all recognise that we need a broader and more indepth debate on the choices to be made, the options available and the difficulties faced.  I recognise the politics and the need to pass the Bill.  However, we must stop the name calling and practise more mature, sensible and realistic politics.  That is what the public demands; it is tired of Punch and Judy politics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900040#OO02600","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355934000,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister whom I have got to know in the past seven years because we sat beside each other at a committee.  I regard her highly and know that she listens.  Today she will have listened and learned.  I have been present for the two and a half hours of this debate and listened and learned.  I have listened to the stories told, many of which I knew.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien talked about her experiences, while Senator John Crown and others also spoke about theirs.  Recently I was in a house with a carer and saw the need for and the benefit gained from a respite care allowance.<\/p><p>Yesterday I spoke about Members of the Oireachtas having a responsibility to run the State in a manner on which we could look back with pride because we had kept it safe.  I said that I intended to support the Minister on the Bill and hoped we could make positive changes to it in the Seanad.  I believe she has listened to us carefully today.  Senator Fidelma Healy Eames has pointed out that the legislation will not come into operation until 1 June.  Therefore, the Minister has six months to think about what she has learned from us today.  She will have everybody's support if she agrees that the Bill is not the right way to go.  Of all of the items contained in it the respite care grant has been the focus of attention.  <\/p><p>Senator David Norris has said the Seanad needs to earn people's respect and trust, but we must respect the responsibility we have been given.  Sometimes we must pass legislation, even if it is tough.  I recall my experience in business when I made mistakes and put off making decisions because I thought that there might be another way.  Unfortunately, the problems always became worse and eventually one had to take a step, which might have meant a sector had to be closed, resulting in a loss of jobs.  It was then that I realised that I should have faced up to the challenge earlier.  <\/p><p>Senator Paul Bradford said we should have debated the measures in the Bill and done so well ahead of time.  If we had had more time to debate the Bill, most of it would have remained intact.  However, this aspect would not have remained in it because the Minister would have been influenced by the depth of feeling shown and decided against its inclusion.  I shall support the Bill because I am confident that the Minister will do something about the respite care grant when she has time to consider the matter.  When we finish the Committee Stage debate, I would like to hear her say she intends to do everything she can to take account of the depth of feeling shown and the emotions expressed today.  The Seanad places its trust in her to ensure the legislation will be something of which we can both be proud.  If she does not deal with section 5, she will not be proud of herself.  I am confident, therefore, that she will do something about it in the months ahead.  I do not know if she will be able to do so today, but I hope she will in time.<\/p><p>Yesterday I told the Seanad I would support the Bill.  Members of both Houses have a responsibility to make tough decisions, even though they are unpopular.  On this occasion the cut to be made is unpopular.  If we are to be a successful nation and get ourselves out of difficulty, we must make tough decisions.  We all rely on the Minister in this regard.  I gather from what has been said she has six months in which to put the matter right and I hope this debate has helped her to move in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900041#PP00300","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1355934000,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Like Senator Feargal Quinn, I have been present throughout the debate and listened carefully.  I agree with him that we have had an instructive and informative debate, with some passionate and thought-provoking contributions.  I agree with Senator Paul Bradford on the need for advance notice of measures.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and recently we learned about the Finnish system under which committees have a certain budget.  For example, for a period of months the social protection committee will debate, on a cross-party basis, where cuts and savings can be made and where money should be spent.  That model is infinitely more preferable to the one we have inherited and kept by virtue of tradition.  I hope we will examine the system next year and introduce something closer to the Finnish model under which debate takes place in advance of the announcement of measures and legislation.<\/p><p>Other colleagues have mentioned where savings can be made.  Senator John Crown, in particular, raised the issue of subsidies for the greyhound and horse sectors.  I agree with him and have raised the issue in the past.  <\/p><p>Yesterday the Minister stated she wished she did not have to make cuts to social welfare payments.  She pointed out that nobody ever wanted to cut social welfare payments for its own sake.  Everyone, on both sides of the House, will agree that she has been a champion for the social protection budget.  She has had the remarkable achievement of securing an extra \u20ac150 million this year.  She has also managed to preserve the basic rates of social welfare, including the weekly carer's and domiciliary care allowance payments.  These achievements are a testament to her work.  It is also important to note that she has managed to secure funding for 10,000 additional job activation places and \u20ac30 million for 6,000 child care places for the children of low income families and school meals in disadvantaged communities.  We must acknowledge her work and that it is a balancing act.  <\/p><p>With regard to section 5, we regret that the cut must be made.  Senator Feargal Quinn has said it will be six months before the cut takes effect.  There are constructive things we can to do ameliorate its impact.  All of us respect and acknowledge the enormous work done by carers.  As Senator Aideen Hayden has pointed out, the Government has spent more on carers than any other Government.  The cost this year is \u20ac775 million.  It is important to note how much the work of carers is valued.  We can, therefore, examine ways to ameliorate the impact of the cut.  Last week in this House I pointed out that many carers were concerned about the provision of respite care places.  There are huge gaps in provision in areas such as south Dublin and D\u00fan Laoghaire.  It is a real issue for carers across the country.  The Minister has agreed to carry out an interdepartmental survey, encompassing the HSE and her Department, early in the new year to identify where the gaps are in the provision of respite care places.<\/p> <p>As Senator Moloney said in the debate last night, that would be an important measure to undertake and I very much hope we will see that early in the new year.  Also, Senator Moloney's suggestion that organisations providing support and respite services to families be invited to make application for some of the additional 10,000 job activation measures could serve in a practical way to address the needs of carers in securing respite places.  The Seanad must examine in a constructive way how best to tackle the difficulties faced by carers and how to address some of the real issues that arise in practice for carers.  That is hugely important and I look forward to further debates in this House on that issue and on reform of child benefit that the Minister promised us also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900041#PP00600","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355934600,"counter":610,"content":"<p>It is right and proper for us, as Members of the Seanad, to stand up for the most vulnerable and the most courageous section of our society.

In many ways they have brought a new freshness to this Chamber because it cannot be easy for them, having been given the gift of a seat by the Taoiseach, to be prepared to put the head above the parapet and, with their particular expertise and experience, to come in here and provide leadership, which is what they are doing now on the floor of the Chamber.<\/p><p>Prior to the budget I had stated in the House that I hoped it would be a fair budget by making those who had the most pay the most.

Senator John Crown is 100% correct, and I do not accept the argument about increasing income tax affecting employment.  The same applies to VAT and to any other charge.  What would be wrong with putting an extra 1% or 2% on every one of us in this House who could well afford to pay it and on many other people outside it?

My gut feeling at the outset was that some of them, specifically the blanket cut in child benefit and the cut in the respite care grant, were wrong.  A solemn pledge was made not long ago as I was travelling door to door and meeting people in my own area of Kilfinane, Kilmallock, Bruff, and all areas throughout my constituency and the county of Limerick.  My party said we would not cut child benefit.  That pledge is now broken and in good conscience I cannot be party to that.  I promised people in desperate circumstances, hard-working, middle income earners, that I would do what I could to make things better for them.  There is an inherent unfairness in hitting carers and children, regardless of their personal circumstances, especially when there was a choice to be made.  A temporary solidarity measure would have been to tax high earners but that was decided against.<\/p><p>I urge those on high incomes who are in receipt of these payments to consider giving them back if they do not need them.<\/p>                                                 \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, Labhr\u00e1s. <p>I will remain a Labour Party man and will commit all my efforts to addressing and reversing what I see as unjust cuts, especially those that are harshest on middle and low-income, hard-working families.

I have consulted widely on this decision both within my constituency and community and among the broader Labour Party family.  Ultimately, this decision is my own.  I do not fly any flag of convenience.  I have the utmost respect for my Seanad colleagues and all my colleagues in the Labour Party.

A young man in Longford who has a disability asked me not to take away his mother's carer's grant because she cannot cope without it.  Another mother at that meeting whose child needs special shoes that cost &#8364;460 was going to use the extra money in the respite care grant to buy the shoes but she will not have the money to buy them.  I have a note from a parent of a special needs child who asked me to relay this message:<ul>The respite care grant is not used for a jolly holiday or anything of the sort.  The respite care grant is used throughout the year to pay for therapies my son sorely needs which are not available publicly, among other things, essential to providing my son with the best chance he has of not being a burden to the State in the future in the form of residential care.  This minuscule saving to the State coffers will ultimately cost the Exchequer infinitely more in years to come.<\/ul>   I have one other note which states: <ul>I am a carer to a nine year old boy who has autism.  The recent budget has hit us very hard, we were already just getting by, I have no idea how we will survive financially.  The huge cut to the respite care grant, just has me in tears, I use that money to keep my car on the road and oil in the tank (my son has mobility issues, so a car is a necessity).  I didn't want to be a carer, but that is where I have found myself due to my son's disability, and there's no better person for the job than me his mother, I love my son dearly and just want what is best for his future, it would be nice though to have a little support from our Government to help me do my job, instead of being made feel like a scrounger.  I worked Full-time for as long as I could but had no option but to give up my job and become my son's carer.<\/ul>  The debate around this issue has forgotten the people it is supposed to be about.  We are discussing a cut to the respite care grant but we have forgotten the carers.  The politics has taken over.  I have the greatest respect for all my fellow Senators and all the contributions made today but I hope we do not forget the carers in the debate.<\/p><p>  We had an interesting debate on the JobBridge scheme where the Minister told me about her expertise in accountancy and in business.  However, I do not accept that she could not find another way of getting &#8364;26 million in order that this cut would not have to go through.  I accept this is not her decision and that she has been put under constraints due to the economic situation and the Government situation.  She was given a budget to disburse through the Government.  There are responsibilities specifically in respect of the respite care grant.  Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa put it more eloquently than me when he said we should not make the respite carers the fodder in this political battle, if it is a political battle.  I think the Minister would have it within her remit to go back and try to find the &#8364;26 million elsewhere.  If that cannot be done, I find it hard to believe the Government cannot find within the coffers &#8364;26 million to ensure this cut does not go ahead.<\/p><p>  We have put forward proposals, one of which is a wealth tax.  If the Minister was to accept it, at the lowest possible scenario it would more than cover four or five of the cuts in the Social Welfare Bill.  Therefore, there are options.  I do not believe that a person of the Minister's calibre and expertise in business and accountancy could not find that &#8364;26 million.  If the Minister cannot find it within her wont, there is a choice to be made by Senators on the Government side.  They have heard all the arguments and have to choose.  Senators have made some brave decisions.  I commend those decisions being made.  Senators have to vote with their conscience and, therefore, have to vote against this section of the Bill because it is unfair on carers.  <\/p><p>  This will be a seminal moment in the life of the Seanad.  I know the eyes of the nation and the media, in particular, are on us.  The vote on this section and the vote on the Bill today will be a moment of truth as to whether the Seanad is up to standing up for what is right.  It is not about being political, it is about not putting the respite care grant in jeopardy and not making carers pay for the decisions that will be made.  If the Minister were to reverse the &#8364;26 million cut I would call on Sinn F\u00e9in members not to jump up and down making political hay on this issue because it is simply the wrong cut.  I call on her to intimate to us that she will withdraw it because that would take the pressure off some of her Labour Party Members who have been put under awful pressure on this issue.  Most of all it would give relief to those carers who asked me to bring their story to the Minister.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900043#RR00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355935200,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I have listened with great interest and humility to many of the contributions and, in particular, from my good friend, since becoming a Member, Senator James Heffernan, who took a difficult decision.

Unfortunately, not all showed the same dignity of purpose as Senator Heffernan.  I certainly have a conscience.  I am not going to be lectured by anybody on my conscience in terms of doing the right thing for people with disabilities, because for too long people with disabilities have been used as a political football by party politics and politicians in an appallingly crass fashion.

I have their budget briefing with me and, having gone through it, can say that it includes no mention of the respite care grant.  The main concern of the Carers Association was the protection of the half-rate carer's allowance.  Carers were extremely worried about it and the Minister did what they asked.  I suggested yesterday a way to give something back to carers by putting in place weekly respite for carers who cannot move outside their houses and are there 24\/7.  We are only talking about the Carers Association sending someone to the house to let the carer go to the dentist, the hairdresser or for a walk.  I met a couple who said they would love a night out on the town.  All they want is someone to come in at 7 p.m. when their child had gone to bed and sit until midnight.  The Carers Association provides that service and I ask the Minister to enhance it.  It is a weekly respite rather than a yearly payment and it would be of great benefit to carers.  The Opposition does not have a monopoly on meeting carers.  I have met carers who are angry.  I have met carers who said they could live with the cut to the respite grant provided the respite in St. John of Gods or other institution is maintained.  Carers fear that and the threat of a 25% reduction to their respite and school transport for children with special needs.  Those possibilities worried some carers more than the reduction in the respite care grant.<\/p><p>It is a difficult decision.

In 2006, at the height of the boom, the respite care grant was much less than \u20ac1,375.  Nobody wants to take these hard decisions but hard decisions have to be made in a budget and in a Social Welfare Bill.  I and my colleagues will support the provisions in the Bill in the hope that when things improve, as they will, although some people here might not want them to, we can rectify this situation for the respite care grant. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900044#SS02900","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355936400,"counter":650,"content":"<p>As the Minister is aware, the cuts in social welfare and their cumulative effect are a difficult issue for people on both sides of this House and for people outside the House who are struggling.  I accept the bona fides of people here if they vote conscientiously whether for or against the Bill.  It is very difficult for people to go against the party Whip.  Senator James Heffernan has displayed great courage in doing so.  It is not easy.  I have been in that position and it is difficult when one has allegiances to one's colleagues and one's party.  As Senator Cummins said, hard decisions must be taken but within them there are choices.  I oppose the choices that have been made, not just this year but in previous years.  It was a major mistake for the Government parties to commit to ring-fencing almost 80% of expenditure and say they would not touch social welfare rates or public service pay.<\/p><p>Suicide has been debated many times in this House.  People have succumbed to despair because of their financial predicament in recent years.  We must not only show empathy with, and sympathy for, those families that have been bereaved but also with those many others who are seriously struggling to make ends meet and worrying about where they will get their next mortgage payment or money to put food on the table.  That is the case for many.  On the back of my card I have a quotation from Pedro Arrupe &quot;Let there be men and women who will bend their energies, not to strengthen positions of privilege, but to the extent possible to reduce privilege in favour of the underprivileged.&quot;  I try to live by that principle.  I do not always succeed but it is an aspiration for politicians.  Sometimes we need some form of idealism to guide us in the decisions we take.  <\/p><p>The Minister says she is not cutting social welfare rates but she is.  For example, she is cutting child benefit and she is cutting the respite care grant by 20%.  That will have an impact on families.  If she considers it from the economic point of view, which may well be driving the Government's agenda in many other areas, including social policy, it is imperative that we endeavour to place the burden where it can be carried and not place it on people who are in no position to shoulder this increased pain.  This and other decisions that are being taken and have been taken will make it almost impossible for many to deal with these issues in 2013.  We will see an increase in the social fallout from this economic crisis in the next 12 months or thereabouts.  <\/p><p>The cut in the respite care grant will save \u20ac26 million.  The cut in child benefit will save \u20ac136 million, making a total of \u20ac162 million.  A 3% increase in the universal social charge for those earning above \u20ac100,000 would bring in approximately \u20ac200 million.  The Labour Party was right to seek that as our party was right to include it in our budgetary provisions.  One of the great imponderables is that increments in the public service have continued since 2008.  Ours were stopped in 2008.  All public service increments should have been stopped.  That would amount to between \u20ac200 million and \u20ac250 million a year.  A 1% cut in public service pay comes to \u20ac170 million.  A 1% cut across the board in social welfare rates, which would be \u20ac2 a week, would bring in the guts of \u20ac220 million.  Nobody likes doing these things.  We are crucifying a small group of people who make an enormous contribution to the Exchequer.  If they did not do the job they do the Minister knows, as do all of us in this House, a huge financial burden would be placed on the State which it would not be able to carry.  I appeal to the Minister, who has her heart in the right place and is caring, to take whatever stand is necessary, maybe a stand such as Senator Heffernan has taken.  Unless people are prepared to stand up and be counted, the underprivileged, disadvantaged and those who are really suffering will continue to be railroaded.  It is time that this stopped.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900045#TT00200","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1355936400,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I have been listening quietly, maybe uncharacteristically, to this debate all afternoon, which has been very informative.  Most of the contributions have been genuine and made in good faith and well articulated with passion.  The Opposition's job is to hold the Government to account.  It is doing a good job of that today.  It has put forward several suggestions for alternative savings, such as a wealth tax, increments, horses, advisers, bureaucrats, a sugar tax, a tobacco tax and an increase in the universal social charge, all of which could well be supported.  Despite the Minister having saved \u20ac390 million in her Department, which is spending \u20ac20.2 billion, the cost of social protection is going up by \u20ac150 million this year.  If the Minister did not make this saving the cost of social protection would increase by \u20ac500 million.  That is the fact.<\/p><p>We could do all that the Opposition suggests, and I think we should do many of these things but we must do them in addition to the other measures.  No one will say that we should allow the cost of social protection to grow.  Opposition Members will all agree with me on that point.  In the 1980s the Labour Party and Fine Gael did not make the necessary decisions.  I hate the phrase &quot;hard decisions&quot; because the decision-makers are not affected by the decisions.  The hard decisions affect other people.  They allowed the deficit to grow until they drove the country almost into the ground.  The country is almost in the ground, even moreso than in the 1980s, and we must do these things.  If we say that we will not reduce the respite care grant where will we make the savings?  Do we make them in the disability sector, in jobseeker's allowance, carer's allowance, rent or lone parent's allowance, or in family income support, domiciliary care or household benefits?  No matter where the reductions are made in any of these benefits those affected will say they are unfair.  They are certainly unpalatable and no Government, not even that of the Opposition when it was in government, would even dream of making them unless they were necessary.<\/p><p>I recognise that the Opposition Senators are genuine about their proposals and their passion but I dislike their saying that we sheepishly and slavishly follow the Whip.  I am not sheepishly and slavishly following a Whip.  I have put a great deal of thought into this and have said that I will support the Government.  These are unpopular, terrible things to do but I will support them because that is the right thing to do.  Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa said there is a right thing to do.  There are many right things to do, one of which is to protect and ring-fence money for one group of people.  Difficult as it is, the right thing to do is to put the interests of the country first and support the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900045#TT00300","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1355937000,"counter":652,"content":"<p>Senator Moran asked last night if I wanted to say something and I was vacillating whether I would do so.  I do not know whether I will hold this together but I will try my best.  On 17 March 1992, St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, our lives changed forever.  My now 20 year old was born.  As Senator Cummins has outlined, she is a chronic epileptic and does not really speak.  She has a vocabulary of approximately 24 or 25 words.  Anyone who wants to tell me or my good wife about caring can go ahead and try.  The first day I walked in the back gate here I got a telephone call one hour later to go home because she was in an accident and emergency department following a bad seizure.  I will not be lectured on my conscience.  I wanted to get that much out of the way.<\/p><p>  There are cures and remedies.  Before anyone goes home today I ask them to do one thing for me, namely, go to the library and read page two of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  That is all they need to do today.  There is an article about service providers and carers referring to all the wonderful work of the Sisters of Mercy and Daughters of Charity and the Brothers of Charity.  The &#8364;300 in question would buy my young lady a half a day of care at the Brothers of Charity in Clare.  It costs &#8364;2,800 to open the house there at the weekend.  Apart from the epilepsy, my young lady is manageable.  She is okay with her friends and they manage in the house.  However, we should not be spending &#8364;2,800 to open the house at the weekend and I said as much to the Minister recently when we were discussing it.  The money should follow the client.  This is the greatest decisions we could ever make and it is job No. 1.  We should buy the service where we want to buy it.<\/p><p>  I hope the Cathaoirleach will give me some latitude.  The model of service delivery in this country is wrong.  Up to now we have fired money at a raft of agencies.  They have wonderful and different names.  Four of them contacted me in recent weeks about the cut in the carer's allowance and I e-mailed all of them in reply.  I asked for a set of their annual accounts, what they were paying the chief executive and what the top ten salaries were.  Lo and behold I got no reply and no more contact from them either.  However, the details are in the newspaper today.  We understand a lady in St. Michael&#8217;s House - I will leave her name out of it but she is the chief executive - is earning in excess of &#8364;200,000.  Some &#8364;75 million is going to that organisation.  The Brothers of Charity received &#8364;187 million and the chief executive earns &#8364;150,000.  The top people in Enable Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association earn similar salaries.  Under the model of service delivery when these bodies were set up we got money, appointed a chief executive and paid him from &#8364;80,000 to &#8364;200,000.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900046#UU00200","speaker":"1134"},{"type":"speech","time":1355937000,"counter":653,"content":"<p>You are touching the microphone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900046#UU00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1355937000,"counter":654,"content":"<p>There are people in this House who set up agencies and paid chief executives in excess of &#8364;80,000.  I am a member of a group in Clare.  They may speak for themselves if they so wish.  They have called me often enough when I was in the House but I am here now.  I am a member of a voluntary group in Clare, the Clare Crusaders.  A total of &#8364;260,000 has been raised by the service in Clare and it is run on a voluntary basis.  We provide a service to 240 children with not a bob from the State.  No one is paid and there is no chief executive.  We pay the therapists.  The organisation is run in the same was as a school.  We set up a board of management and we hire the therapists.  However, this will be a cross-departmental issue because &#8364;2.449 billion is going to these agencies and advocacy groups.<\/p><p>  I have referred to advocacy groups already and I wish to put it on the record again today.  All the funding going to advocacy groups should be stopped now for the same reason, namely, they do not provide any service.  I do not need anyone else to advocate for what my child needs.  I would prefer to have the service.  The Carers Association was referred to some time ago.  I asked what the chief executive of that association received.  As far as I know he walked out of one job and into another.  This is the type of carry on we find.  People should read page two of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  If they do they will get a good education about where all the money, some &#8364;2.449 billion in total, is going.  Respite hours are being cut.  How did that happen?  The staff are still there because we did not let any of them go.  We cannot do so because they are covered by the Croke Park agreement.  What do they do?  They cut the respite hours.  They cut ten days per year.  There is not much left after that.<\/p><p>  I said to Senator Moran that I would say a few words today.  I put all of this on the record and I stand over every word I have said.  If we do nothing else this year we should ensure the money follows the client.  I should be able to buy the service where I want to buy it.  It will not be provided to me by the so-called voluntary bodies and service providers.  There is nothing voluntary about them and there never was.  They are organisations that have ripped off this country for years.

We have had a fantastic debate and education today on where the money is being spent.  We have heard many great ideas about how we could spend it more usefully in future.  I hope we have started a further conversation with the Minister on how we might address much of the inequity in the social welfare system.  There is no doubt that the way we dispense funding within the social welfare budget is inequitable and unfair in many instances.  There is no doubt that in the case of the carer's respite grant some are not getting enough but there are many people who are getting more than they should.<\/p><p>Senator Moloney made a fantastic suggestion.  The carer's grant is being dropped by \u20ac325.  I put it to the Minister, Deputy Burton, that in some way between now and the coming six months she should see how \u20ac325 worth of care could be provided through community employment schemes or through the carers' associations or the various community organisations operating so effectively in the country.  If the Minister did this she would be doing a great service.  The people involved would continue to hold on to the \u20ac1,350 they have but they would get \u20ac325 worth of care in the community as well.

Great credit is due to Irish society for one thing we have done.  I listened to Senator Mulcahy talking about his daughter and his family situation.  It is true with this House as it is for most of Irish society that at some stage all of us have cared for people or we will do so in future, because it is part of the human condition.  In fairness to both sides in a way we are speaking about ourselves, people close to us or people we know or have worked with.<\/p><p>Senator Mulcahy is someone in that situation currently, looking after a cherished child.  Let us remember back to 40 years ago to this country.  At the time, people with a mild to moderate physical or intellectual disability would have ended up not being in an ordinary primary school with their peers but probably would have been institutionalised especially as they got older, bigger and heavier.  Some of the changes are due simply to changes in technology and medical skills and supports.  However, there has been another change that reflects rather well on Ireland.  No one involved in politics agrees on everything but we have moved forward.  Wherever one goes in this country, whether for a social occasion or otherwise, one can meet someone who is a special person.<\/p> <p>When we hosted occasions such as the Special Olympics, the entire country celebrated with the participants.  That is not the case in every country and it is something we can recognise as an Irish achievement.  Some 40 or even 25 years ago many children who were profoundly deaf ended up in schools for the deaf.  Nowadays it is relatively unusual for a child who is profoundly deaf to be anywhere other than in a mainstream school with additional support to cope with his or her disability.  That is progress.  <\/p><p>A Senator asked why we compared ourselves with other countries.  We do so in order to mark what we do well and where we can do better.  An economist wrote about Greece in one of our newspapers last week after European journalists had been taken on a trip to that country.  The concept of a carer's allowance is largely unknown in Greece.  It is not that people there do not care for family members but that a structure of support is not available via the social welfare system.  The collapse of funding for regional governments in Spain means a considerable number of public servants working in care institutions and hospitals are hardly being paid and, in a couple of cases, are not being paid at all.<\/p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien asked what was the position of the troika on these matters.  Perhaps this question warrants a full debate in the House.  To a certain extent, the troika speaks with a forked tongue.  It states we can do this, that and the other but that it wants its money back.  The agreement with it includes a specific commitment to introduce consolidation measures - troika speak for expenditure cuts - amounting to at least \u20ac3.5 billion in 2013.  This is not negotiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900046#UU00700","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355937600,"counter":659,"content":"<p>We accept that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900047#VV00200","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1355937600,"counter":660,"content":"<p>With due respect to the various charming people of the troika, this commitment is not negotiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900047#VV00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1355937600,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I met them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900047#VV00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1355937600,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I lived in Tanzania, a very poor east African country.

Of course, I would have liked to have reduced it still further.<\/p><p>Senator Mary White spoke about the 5,000 people who received no payment besides the respite care grant.  Such individuals are above the income limit for carer's allowance and half rate carer's allowance, which is \u20ac70,000 for a couple.  Therefore, they have access to significant income.  Senators have pointed to the importance of the respite care grant to them and that it is an acknowledgement by the State of the care they provide using their own financial resources.  During the pre-budget debates in this House we did not spend much time on a realistic discussion of the options available.  <\/p><p>Senator Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill claimed that there were no cuts proposed in Fianna F\u00e1il's pre-budget document, but savings of \u20ac200 million were identified in respect of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  This year the Department of Social Protection has saved \u20ac625 million in that regard.<\/p>                                                 \u00d3 Murch\u00fa, Labhr\u00e1s. <p>Does it count for troika expenditure reduction purposes?  No, it does not.  It simply stops further spending.  The only way it would count - this is a proposal I made - is if we could recover an increasing amount of those payments that should not have been made.  This is covered in section 13 of the Bill.  I proposed in the Department's budget that we try to recover at least \u20ac20 million this year.  If we can recover more, some of the possibilities raised by others are open to us.  As E. M. Forster says, everything is connected.<\/p><p>The Social Welfare Bill stands as one piece of the jigsaw.  It is not possible to remove the respite care grant from the Bill without derailing and delaying the rest of the Bill.  This may not be good news for many Members, but it is the constitutional legal fact.  Although the grant is not paid until June, removing the provision would give rise to costs.  As I said yesterday, the 90-day pause would cost \u20ac127 million, if it was a full 90-day pause.  Unfortunately, that would then need to be found from the rest of the social welfare budget, unless other Departments were willing to give up something from their budgets.<\/p><p>A number of Senators referred to a proposal made by Senator Moloney that we should look at the number of additional places we are securing for local employment initiatives and community employment in order to expand care services.  I am open to that.  Many of those organisations are involved in providing and assisting with care and in community employment schemes.  We propose to provide an extra 2,000 places on community employment and an extra 2,500 places on T\u00fas.  If any organisations, family or community centres around the country which provide activities related to older people, children and people with disabilities make proposals for extra places in those areas, I would be happy to consider them seriously.<\/p><p>In May, the Government published the carer strategy.  This strategy is important because it brings together a number of themes we have had the opportunity to discuss today.  Hand on heart, based on my experience of people I know who care, if a significant sum of money was found to be available tomorrow, my instinct would be to try to solve the issue of the lack of respite care places.  This is a major issue for the families I know, including some of my relatives.  The way it works now is that carers could phone tomorrow or the next day to make plans to get a number of days' respite for next month or the month after.  Some people appear to be scandalised by the fact that some carers get a little bit of time out and use the respite care grant to go on a break.  Such breaks are vital.  In a family where a carer is caring for somebody with a serious disability, there are often other siblings in the house.  It is when the respite care is available that the rest of the family gets some down time, whether in their own home or on a short holiday.  Originally, this was the core purpose of the respite care grant.<\/p><p>The Department has done surveys on respite care and it knows that significant numbers of carers spend the grant on ordinary living expenses.  However, that is not something that is a matter for this House.  We do not ask people how exactly they spend their child benefit.  We know that by and large it is spent on children and that families choose different ways to spend it.  Most people seem happy that it is spent on children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900047#VV03000","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355938200,"counter":687,"content":"<p>I remind the Minister that we are due to conclude at 7 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900048#WW00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1355938200,"counter":688,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I am anxious that we dispose of section 5 and would be grateful for the Minister's co-operation in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900048#WW00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1355938200,"counter":689,"content":"<p>That is not a point of order.

First, it will provide a stable funding base for the local authority sector, incorporating appropriate elements of local authority responsibility.  It will strongly reinforce local democratic decision-making and encourage greater efficiency by local authorities on behalf of their electorates.  Second, it will deliver significant structural reform through broadening the base for taxation in a manner that does not directly impact on employment and thereby contribute significantly to meeting the immediate financial requirements of the EU-IMF programme.<\/p><p>Before I get to the detailed sections of the Bill, I wish to respond to some of the issues and concerns raised in the other House and elsewhere since publication of this legislation.  There has been some criticism of the decision to give the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for the collection of the local property tax.  I do not intend to apologise for giving the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for administering the local property tax.  They have vast experience in the legislation, systems and collection and enforcement procedures necessary for the smooth running of the tax system.  It has been claimed that the deferral system and the 4% simple interest rate will force people to sell their homes.  This is a blatant exaggeration.  The rate of tax is 0.18%.  A deferral for 20 years would result in an outstanding charge of just 5.1% of the value of the property - 3.6% representing 20 years of deferred tax at 0.18% and 1.512% representing the accumulated interest.  The level of progressivity and equity of the local property tax among those on the average industrial wage and those on \u20ac200,000 per year has been criticised.  If such persons are liable for this tax, they will pay the same amounts if they have residential properties which are of the same value.  In general, people on higher incomes will have higher value properties.  A higher rate of this tax is being applied to properties valued over \u20ac1 million.<\/p><p>The local property tax has been referred to as being anti-Dublin.  The market values of residential properties vary considerably throughout the country.  The market value of a residential property is related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it is located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood.  There will be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owner in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the property.  Owners of more valuable properties would pay more under a market value-based assessment scheme.  Taxable values based on market valuations would generally be higher in urban than in rural areas.  This is equitable to the extent that market value provides a measure of the value of a residential property to the owner, particularly in terms of its proximity to places of work and local amenities and facilities.<\/p><p>In relation to mortgage arrears, the Government is conscious of the difficulty some homeowners are experiencing in meeting their mortgage obligations.  The main focus of attention is on those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulties in meeting their commitments in respect of their homes.  A range of measures is being advanced in this area, including personal insolvency reform, the implementation of the mortgage to rent initiative, the engagement with mortgage lenders on the development and implementation by them of mortgage arrears resolution strategies and the provision of a mortgage advisory function.  Each family in mortgage arrears faces unique difficulties.  We must have a range of solutions which can be adapted to resolve each family's difficulties.  A system of voluntary deferral arrangements focused on particular categories of householders will be implemented to address cases where there is an inability to pay the local property tax under specific conditions.<\/p><p>The lack of a relief against the local property tax for people who paid large amounts of stamp duty has been mentioned.  The payment of a large amount of stamp duty at the height of the property boom was not recommended by the Thornhill group as a basis for relief, as it does not have regard to ability to pay.  In making its recommendation the group was influenced by several considerations in regard to those who had paid large sums of stamp duty during the property boom, including the fact that the impact of such a relief on taxpayers would not be targeted on those in need.  The system of deferrals provided for in the property tax is more closely targeted at ability to pay than any exemption for stamp duty paid would be.<\/p><p>The local property tax will apply to local authority houses.  I note that domestic rates are charged on local authority properties in Northern Ireland and collected through the rental system.  The Thornhill group considered whether local authorities should be liable as owners.  Notwithstanding the economic arguments in favour of that approach, the group, on balance, did not favour creating a circular flow of payments.  The Government's view is that issues of proportionality could arise if owners and local authority tenants were treated differently.  While reform of differential rents would contribute to horizontal equity between local authority tenants and low income owners, anomalies could arise in cases where local authorities owned and rented out properties in otherwise privately owned housing estates.  The tenants in such properties would not be subject to the local property tax, whereas the owners of other properties in the same estate would have to pay it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900050#ZZ00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1355939100,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I must put the question: \"That section 5, and each of the sections undisposed of, are hereby agreed to in committee, the Title is hereby agreed to in committee, and the Bill is hereby reported to the House without amendment.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900050#YY00100","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1355939100,"counter":723,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p><p>The Seanad divided by electronic means.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1355939100,"counter":724,"content":"<p>Under Standing Order 62(3)(b) I request that the division be taken again other than by electronic means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900050#YY00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"vote","time":1355939100,"counter":725,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 31; N\u00edl, 28.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900050#YY00300","aye":["1148","1121","1138","1150","1114","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1160","1117","1144","1172","1131","1152","1173","1135","1161","1162","1132","1174","1134","1118","1153","1129","1125","1145","1163","1143"],"nay":["1157","1116","1147","1133","1159","1119","1140","1167","1149","1168","1128","1146","1136","1139","1169","1170","1127","1142","1122","1123","1115","1154","1155","1171","1126","1156","1164","1176"]},{"type":"speech","time":1355939700,"counter":726,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Report Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900051#ZZ00100","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1355939700,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1355939700,"counter":728,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1355939700,"counter":729,"content":"<p>Let us hope the Seanad is treated a little better tomorrow.

First, it will provide a stable funding base for the local authority sector, incorporating appropriate elements of local authority responsibility.  It will strongly reinforce local democratic decision-making and encourage greater efficiency by local authorities on behalf of their electorates.  Second, it will deliver significant structural reform through broadening the base for taxation in a manner that does not directly impact on employment and thereby contribute significantly to meeting the immediate financial requirements of the EU-IMF programme.<\/p><p>Before I get to the detailed sections of the Bill, I wish to respond to some of the issues and concerns raised in the other House and elsewhere since publication of this legislation.  There has been some criticism of the decision to give the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for the collection of the local property tax.  I do not intend to apologise for giving the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for administering the local property tax.  They have vast experience in the legislation, systems and collection and enforcement procedures necessary for the smooth running of the tax system.  It has been claimed that the deferral system and the 4% simple interest rate will force people to sell their homes.  This is a blatant exaggeration.  The rate of tax is 0.18%.  A deferral for 20 years would result in an outstanding charge of just 5.1% of the value of the property - 3.6% representing 20 years of deferred tax at 0.18% and 1.512% representing the accumulated interest.  The level of progressivity and equity of the local property tax among those on the average industrial wage and those on \u20ac200,000 per year has been criticised.  If such persons are liable for this tax, they will pay the same amounts if they have residential properties which are of the same value.  In general, people on higher incomes will have higher value properties.  A higher rate of this tax is being applied to properties valued over \u20ac1 million.<\/p><p>The local property tax has been referred to as being anti-Dublin.  The market values of residential properties vary considerably throughout the country.  The market value of a residential property is related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it is located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood.  There will be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owner in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the property.  Owners of more valuable properties would pay more under a market value-based assessment scheme.  Taxable values based on market valuations would generally be higher in urban than in rural areas.  This is equitable to the extent that market value provides a measure of the value of a residential property to the owner, particularly in terms of its proximity to places of work and local amenities and facilities.<\/p><p>In relation to mortgage arrears, the Government is conscious of the difficulty some homeowners are experiencing in meeting their mortgage obligations.  The main focus of attention is on those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulties in meeting their commitments in respect of their homes.  A range of measures is being advanced in this area, including personal insolvency reform, the implementation of the mortgage to rent initiative, the engagement with mortgage lenders on the development and implementation by them of mortgage arrears resolution strategies and the provision of a mortgage advisory function.  Each family in mortgage arrears faces unique difficulties.  We must have a range of solutions which can be adapted to resolve each family's difficulties.  A system of voluntary deferral arrangements focused on particular categories of householders will be implemented to address cases where there is an inability to pay the local property tax under specific conditions.<\/p><p>The lack of a relief against the local property tax for people who paid large amounts of stamp duty has been mentioned.  The payment of a large amount of stamp duty at the height of the property boom was not recommended by the Thornhill group as a basis for relief, as it does not have regard to ability to pay.  In making its recommendation the group was influenced by several considerations in regard to those who had paid large sums of stamp duty during the property boom, including the fact that the impact of such a relief on taxpayers would not be targeted on those in need.  The system of deferrals provided for in the property tax is more closely targeted at ability to pay than any exemption for stamp duty paid would be.<\/p><p>The local property tax will apply to local authority houses.  I note that domestic rates are charged on local authority properties in Northern Ireland and collected through the rental system.  The Thornhill group considered whether local authorities should be liable as owners.  Notwithstanding the economic arguments in favour of that approach, the group, on balance, did not favour creating a circular flow of payments.  The Government's view is that issues of proportionality could arise if owners and local authority tenants were treated differently.  While reform of differential rents would contribute to horizontal equity between local authority tenants and low income owners, anomalies could arise in cases where local authorities owned and rented out properties in otherwise privately owned housing estates.  The tenants in such properties would not be subject to the local property tax, whereas the owners of other properties in the same estate would have to pay it.<\/p> <p>I understand most of the various bodies that comprise the voluntary and co-operative sector in respect of the provision of social housing would have been approved for charitable status by the Revenue Commissioners.  Indeed, such bodies must have such charitable status before they can be approved by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for funding to be used in the provision of social housing.<\/p><p> The Government is aware of the important role played by the approved housing bodies in the provision of housing for those who face difficulty in living in our communities.  To the extent that such groups are engaged in the provision of special needs housing, they should be eligible for the exemption for such housing, which is provided for in the Bill.  However, such groups also provide general needs housing in the same way as a local authority provides such housing.  Most of their funding is provided by local authorities, the tenants are taken from local authority waiting lists and a similar type of differential rents system applies.  Depending on the level of local authority funding provided, some voluntary bodies may have flexibility to provide housing for those not eligible for local authority housing.  To provide for a blanket exemption for such bodies would obviously be inequitable<i>vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i>local authority tenants.  For this reason, the Government decided not to accept the recommendation in the Thornhill report that all charitable bodies should be exempt but to restrict the exemption to those properties that are used to provide special needs accommodation to persons who, for reasons of old age, physical or mental disability, or other cause, need special accommodation and support to enable them to live in the community.<\/p><p> The Revenue Commissioners, who will be responsible for the administration of the local property tax, will publish guidelines to enable liable persons to complete the property tax return and, in particular, to determine whether their property is an exempt property, including whether it qualifies for an exemption on the grounds that the property is used solely or primarily to provide special needs accommodation.  However, I acknowledge that Government policy places significant emphasis on the approved housing body sector as an important part of social housing supply in the future.  The Government will actively engage with approved housing bodies to ensure the local property tax does not impact on their ability to deliver housing units.<\/p><p> In addition to the preceding commitments, I have also previously indicated my willingness to review the provisions of the Bill in regard to two other areas.  There have been some requests for amendments to exempt those residential properties affected by pyrite or pyritic heave.  The Government is conscious of the difficulties faced by owners of such properties and I have previously advised that I will address this matter in the Finance Bill 2013.<\/p><p> Under section 11(3) of the Bill, the personal representatives of a deceased person who was a liable person is also a liable person where the estate includes a residential property.  The reason for making a personal representative a liable person is to prevent the avoidance of the payment of local property tax by means of unnecessarily delaying the distribution of the estate and the transfer of a property to the person who would become the liable person in respect of the property.  However, I appreciate it might not always be possible for the personal representatives to fund the payment of local property tax, whether the tax was owed by the deceased person or by the personal representatives in respect of the period following death.  Addressing this difficulty is not straightforward given the variety of complex circumstances that can pertain to the administration of an estate.  I have already mentioned that my officials will be examining this issue with a view to formulating an appropriate amendment via the Finance Bill.<\/p><p> I will now outline the detail of sections of the Bill.  Part 1, which comprises sections 1 and 2, contains the Short Title, commencement provisions and interpretation sections.  Part 2, comprising sections 3 to 10, provides for definitions of &quot;relevant residential property&quot;, on which the tax will be chargeable, and that certain properties will be regarded as not relevant residential properties and, therefore, exempt from the tax.<\/p><p> Part 3, made up of sections 11 and 12, contains the rules regarding liable persons.  In general, the liable person will be the person who is the owner of the property.  A person with a leasehold interest is liable if the term of the lease can equal or exceed 20 years, or where a person has a life interest in the property.  In the case of property held under trust, the trustees and beneficiaries are jointly and severally liable for the tax.  Where the property is occupied rent-free on a long-term basis but there is no proof of ownership or documentation establishing the interest that the occupier holds in the property, the occupier may be regarded as the liable person.<\/p><p> Part 4, comprising sections 13 to 21, contains the charging provisions of the Bill.  The first valuation date will be 1 May 2013 and the valuation on this date will be valid from 2013 to 2016 inclusive.  Thereafter, the valuation date that will apply will be 1 November in the year preceding each three-year period; so the valuation date for the period 2017 to 2019 will be 1 November 2016.  Where the liable person changes between valuation dates - that is, where the property changes hands - the chargeable value will continue to apply to the new liable person.<\/p><p> Part 5, which comprises sections 22 to 26, contains the standard care and management provisions for Revenue, including the four year time limit on repayments, delegation of functions to authorised officers and allowing for electronic means of return.  Part 6, covering sections 27 to 32, deals with the register of properties to be maintained by Revenue, including the obligation of liable persons to register with the Revenue Commissioners by making a return.<\/p><p> Part 7, made up of sections 33 to 46, relates to the making of returns of local property tax to the Revenue Commissioners.  As indicated, the Bill provides for a self-assessment system and allows for electronic submission of returns by owners of multiple properties and for submission of returns by agents and lessees.  This part will also provide that a failure to submit a local property tax return will lead to a surcharge for late submission of income tax and corporation tax returns.<\/p><p> Part 8, comprising sections 47 to 60, deals with Revenue estimates and assessments.  Revenue will make an estimate of the amount of local property tax due in respect of a property, and will notify the liable person.  Revenue may amend this assessment if it subsequently considers it to be excessive or insufficient.  If a liable person does not submit a local property tax return containing a self-assessment of the local property tax payable, the Revenue estimate will become due and payable.  Revenue assessments will be subject to the normal appeal procedures.<\/p><p> Part 9, comprised of sections 61 to 63, contains the usual appeal procedures for taxes under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  Part 10, which covers sections 64 to 118, contains provision for &quot;deduction at source&quot; of the local property tax from Irish wages, salaries and pensions, from certain payments made by the Department of Social Protection and from certain payments made by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This part also provides that the &quot;deduction at source&quot; provisions may, by order of the Minister for Finance, be extended to cover payments made by other Government Departments or State bodies.  Deduction at source from salary or other regular payments will probably be the most convenient method of payment of the local property tax.  Where an employee opts to have the tax deducted from his or her salary, employers will be obliged to pay the tax to Revenue in the same way as income tax and PRSI is paid.<\/p><p> Part 11, comprising sections 119 to 129, includes the collection and enforcement provisions for the tax, including the due date for payment, the application of the collection and recovery provisions in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to the local property tax, and provisions allowing for payment to be made to payment service providers.  This part provides that any unpaid local property tax will continue to be a charge on property, and that unpaid tax will be payable on the sale of that property.  It also provides that an individual will not receive a tax clearance certificate if he or she has not paid local property tax, unless the individual qualifies for a deferral.<\/p><p> Part 12, which includes sections 130 to 139, provides for deferral of payment of local property tax in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence.  The income thresholds for a full deferral will be &#8364;15,000 for a single person and &#8364;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  A person may claim a deferral if their income will not, &quot;as can reasonably be foreseen at the liability date&quot; exceed these thresholds in that year.  A deferral of up to 50% of the local property tax liability will be possible where the gross income of the liable person does not exceed &#8364;25,000 for a single person or &#8364;35,000 for married persons, civil partners or cohabitants.  An increased income threshold applies in the case of properties occupied as a sole or main residence and subject to a mortgage.<\/p> <p>In such cases, the gross income thresholds may be increased by 80% of the mortgage interest payments.  A deferral option, for qualifying cases, will apply until the end of 2017 and will assist individuals currently in mortgage distress.<\/p><p> Where a liable person no longer satisfies the necessary conditions, amounts deferred prior to the date on which eligibility ceased may continue to be deferred.  Where the spouse or partner of a liable person dies and the income thresholds for a deferral are no longer satisfied, deferral may continue until the next valuation date.  Where a property is transferred by way of gift or inheritance, the Revenue Commissioners may allow an existing deferral to continue if the recipient of the gift or inheritance would in his or her own right be eligible for and makes a valid claim for a deferral.  Full or partial payments may be made against deferred amounts.  Deferred amounts become payable on receipt of windfall gains such as an inheritance.  Simple interest of 4% per annum will apply to any amounts deferred.<br><b><\/b>Part 13, made up of sections 140 to 144,<b><\/b>includes the standard provisions with regard to the powers of the Revenue Commissioners, including the right of Revenue officials to make inquiries in relation to property and its ownership and inspection of relevant records.  Part 14, comprising section 145 to 150,<b><\/b>deals with offences and penalties.  A maximum penalty of &#8364;3,000 applies for failure to submit a true and complete return.  A similar penalty applies for knowingly making a false statement for the purpose of obtaining any advantage to which the person is not entitled. Interest on late payment of the tax is at the standard Revenue rate of 8% per annum.<br><b><\/b>Part 15, covering sections 151 to 153,<b><\/b>provides that certain persons and bodies will be obliged to supply information on residential properties to the Revenue Commissioners when required to do so, including providers of gas and electricity, An Post, the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and local authorities. The information from these bodies will assist in compiling the register of residential properties.<br><b><\/b>Part 16, comprising sections 154 to 156,<b><\/b>contains provisions in regard to the household charge.  The household charge will no longer be payable from 1 January 2013.  Arrears paid before 30 April 2013 will be capped at &#8364;130.  Amounts outstanding after 1 July 2013 will be increased to &#8364;200 and added to local property tax due on the property, to be collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  This is an important assurance for people who paid the household charge that non-payment of the charge will not be ignored and that arrears will be collected.<br><b><\/b>Part 17, covering sections 157 to 159,<b><\/b>contains various supplementary provisions, including a provision for payment of local property tax by the Minister for Finance into the Local Government Fund from 2014.<\/p><p> I hope that the Senators have found this explanation of the measures in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012 useful.  I would like to reiterate that the Government sees the necessary introduction of this tax as an opportunity for very real political reform at local government level.  A small number of amendments are being considered for introduction to the Finance Bill 2013.  I will, of course, also give consideration to any constructive suggestions put forward during our debate today.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900051#ZZ00800","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355940900,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his detailed explanation of the Bill.  It will come as no surprise to the Minister to hear that Fianna F\u00e1il opposes the introduction of the property tax on the basis that it is the wrong time to introduce it and it is the wrong type of property tax.  With regard to the theory of broadening the tax base and looking at how a property tax can be equitably applied, I believe this should be done, although not at this time and for the many reasons outlined by the Minister.<\/p><p>The property tax, in terms of structure, is an anti-urban and, in particular, anti-Dublin tax.  It is a value-based tax.  I live in a three-bedroom terraced house.  Many of my neighbours purchased their houses in 2007.  In 2007, a three-bedroom terraced house in the area in which I live cost \u20ac580,000.  Those who own those houses would be lucky to get \u20ac300,000 for them now.  The situation in regard to mortgage arrears, in respect of which I will put questions to the Minister later, is progressively worsening.  The Minister mentioned the Personal Insolvency Bill, aspects of which I welcome.  What I really want to know - I put this question to the Minister on each occasion he comes to this House, where he is very welcome - is this: where are the mortgage arrears resolution strategies from our banks?  I am not speaking about the people who will have to press the nuclear button under the Personal Insolvency Bill, which means that people will effectively lose their homes; rather, I am speaking about the people who are currently managing to make their mortgage repayments and the long-term measures needed to free up some of their income.  If we were to do that first, I would then be willing to consider a site-value-type property tax.<\/p><p>Given the number of times the Minister and Government have renegotiated the Memorandum of Understanding, it is clear that a measure can be replaced with another of equal value.  I agree in theory with the introduction of a property tax.  However, I believe that in this regard the Government's timing is wrong due to the mortgage arrears situation, with more than one in four people in mortgage arrears of between 30 and 90 days.  Approximately 4% of mortgages are in arrears of over two years.  The situation is not getting any better, for many of the reasons of which the Minister and I are aware and which have been discussed in this House.<\/p><p>Yesterday I asked the Leader a question about local authority and voluntary housing.  What contact has been made between the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities?  Fingal County Council agreed its budget yesterday.  The cost next year to Fingal County Council in respect of the provision of 5,079 social houses will be \u20ac1.6 million.  When my Fianna F\u00e1il colleagues asked the officials of that council where that money would come from, they could not answer.  They also could not say whether there had been any contact between the council and the Department of Finance.  Colleagues who raised the same issue with Dublin City Council also got no answer from that council's officials.  It is important we get this right.<\/p><p>The Minister stated that he proposes to engage with the voluntary housing sector.  How are voluntary housing providers such as the North and East Housing Association Limited, the Iveagh Trust, Cl\u00faid and so on to pay these bills?  I welcome the publication of the Thornhill report, which recommends that local authorities not be subject to the property tax because it would be a circular financial transaction.  This is supposed to be a tax that will fund local authorities.  How are local authorities to pay this tax?  If they are required to pay it they will have to either increase rents or reduce service provision to citizens.  This issue needs to be addressed.  Fianna F\u00e1il has tabled a series of amendments on Report Stage, at which point we can go through the specifics in this regard.<\/p><p>While I do not welcome this Bill in the context of its introducing a property tax, I thank the Minister for the important exemption from payment of this tax of people whose homes are affected by pyrite.  I commend the Minister on that, as I commended the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, yesterday.  It is a growing problem.  My colleagues in the Seanad are sick to death hearing me raise it in this House, which I have done many times during the past eight or nine months.  While I do not welcome the property tax, the exemption in respect of people whose homes are affected by pyrite is welcome.  <\/p><p>There is another issue of concern for people who, like me, are living in managed housing estates or apartments and are paying management fees of up to \u20ac1,900 per annum.  Such people derive little or no service from their local authority.  They pay their own insurance, contribute to the sinking fund for their estate and pay for all services in the estate, including bin collection.  These people are liable for this property tax.  Many of the apartments in which these people live - I discussed this issue earlier with Senator Hayden - are of little value and are worth far less than what was paid for them.<\/p> <p>There is an opportunity here.  We must also consider those people who are paying substantial fees.  If I may say so, the Minister answered well on the matter of deferral and the interest he will charge for that.  I do not know who he is accusing of scaremongering on that point but in his budget announcement it was clear what was meant.  It is not a punitive charge.  What concerns me more is the strict nature of the criteria required to obtain a deferral.  These are complex and one would have to be earning almost nothing to qualify.  This may certainly assist pensioners, and I can see where the Minister is going in that regard, but I refer to households which used to have two incomes, now have one and are already in mortgage arrears, in a worsening situation.  I do not see how this property tax will help that situation but I can see where it will make it worse.  If people get a letter from Revenue, or from the Minister's neighbours or friends - he has passed collection of this to Revenue which, in my view, he should not have - in many instances they will have to decide whether they will pay Revenue the \u20ac500 or \u20ac600 a year, or pay their bank.  I know who I would pay, namely, Revenue.  The crux here is the long-term mortgage arrears resolution measures.  I know it is not easy.  I have asked the Minister a question on this before which is on the record of the House.  The Central Bank received mortgage arrears resolution measures on 30 September.  We have seen no suite of products but we have heard AIB state it would contact 18,000 customers a month.  That is fine and I welcome it.  This is the nut that can be cracked and if we can do that we can look forward to a future situation in which we can properly introduce a property tax.  <\/p><p>I know this will be done in any case and nothing I say in the Chamber tonight will change that.  The Minister rammed the legislation through the D\u00e1il, with 88 amendments in three hours and using a guillotine.  It went through that House and much the same will happen in this one.  The Bill will be passed, will become law and everybody in Dublin will be paying probably twice or two and a half times the average payment in the rest of the country.  Many of these people do not even derive a service from the local authorities, are in negative equity and cannot pay.  It is the wrong time and it is the wrong tax.  We will discuss it in more detail tomorrow, in the specific amendments.  I thank the Minister for his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900053#BBB00200","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355941500,"counter":739,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome.  Nobody welcomes a new tax, however, and I am sure the Minister would prefer not to have introduced this one, had there had been other options.  One must compare the option of a property tax that would raise \u20ac500 million versus an increase in income tax.  The figures I received from the Department on the Minister's budget submission show that income tax is expected to bring in \u20ac15.75 billion next year.  Listening to representatives from the OECD and the Irish Taxation Institute, it is clear we have gone to the limit in regard to income tax.  There is no scope to go further.  That leaves the option to introduce a new property tax, which I have described as the re-introduction of rates that were dissolved in the 1970s.  It may be unpleasant but there are few other options.<\/p><p>I refer to the anti-urban notion, that this is a Dublin tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900054#CCC00200","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1355941500,"counter":740,"content":"<p>Says the Wexford man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900054#CCC00300","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1355941500,"counter":741,"content":"<p>This is not a Dublin tax, it is a national tax.

I speak as one who lives in the country and has always supported rural housing.  Everybody who buys or builds a house in the countryside knows and accepts this is the case.  There is no bus system to bring children to school.  If one has children one does not have the option to keep them at home when they go to university.  One has to send them away, which costs more.  That is the reality.  It is true that houses in the countryside tend to be larger but that is because the cost per site in Dublin is much more expensive.<\/p><p>I welcome that this is a method of funding local authorities.  Something that has gone more or less unnoticed is the plus or minus 15% for local authority members.  Some local authority members come up with the very best of schemes for projects in their area but have no funding stream.  If there is a good funding stream, or a good project that requires funding, local authority members can now put their hands up and vote up to a maximum of 15% increase in how a project can be funded.  That is welcome.  It also enhances the role of local authority members in being abler to ensure that these valuable projects, for which people find it difficult to get funding, can be funded.<\/p><p>I spoke to the Minister on another point, which I believe is very important for people.  The measure is effectively fixed for three years following the declaration by people of house valuation for the property tax.  There will be certainty now in that regard.  The statistics I have been given show that some 75% of homes in the State have a valuation of between \u20ac150,000 and \u20ac200,000.  Taking as a calculation the mid-point of \u20ac175,000 the property tax at the rate of 0.18% will cost \u20ac315 for approximately 70% or 75% of people who will pay the tax.  These figures have been available for some time and the matter has been clearly explained.  The average collection from the household charge was \u20ac100; if that had been trebled the average would have been \u20ac300.  We were also given those figures.<\/p><p>There has been much talk about people who cannot pay.  I doubt if there is anybody in this Chamber who does not know or accept there are people in very difficult financial circumstances.  However, if a person cannot pay, there is a deferral structure in place, which I welcome.  It is a good thing.  If a person cannot pay his or her motor tax that does not mean he or she should not pay it.  Whether we like it or not, and contrary to what is said by some political parties, the vast majority of people in this State pay their taxes, which is right and proper.  If taxes are not paid all the structures stop and fall.  The figures for household charge payment have gone over 70%.  I always maintained that when that figure is reached and approaches the 80% mark it is getting close to the threshold where people will pay.  I use the example of the television licence for which some 15% to 20% of people do not pay.  This is not paid for in the same way as the household charge.  If one has a television one pays the charge which is \u20ac170, by comparison with the household charge of \u20ac100.  That price is irrespective of the area or size of the house and the amount of earnings going into that house.  <\/p><p>I will touch on a number of other issues.  The Revenue Commissioners collect taxes and do their job well.  People may not like what they do but I refer again to those people who choose not to pay other taxes - without collection of taxes the structure will fall.  We need taxes to run the country.  Following the introduction of the household charge which started slowly and began to build, I heard many people ask, &quot;What about those who are choosing not to pay?  Why should the same people who always pay their taxes pay while those who do not effectively get away with it?&quot;  I am glad that for those who chose not to pay the household charge the amount will be rolled forward into the property tax and the charge will remain.  It is the right thing to do in regard to those who have paid, a figure that is now over 70%.<\/p><p>There is a certain amount of hypocrisy about this tax.  Fianna F\u00e1il negotiated the position for \u20ac540 million in the memorandum of understanding.<\/p> <p>What is proposed here is \u20ac40 million less than that.  I thought the Fianna F\u00e1il Party was going in the correct direction in that it had stated that it was going to do what was right.  On this occasion, however, it has reverted to type as a result of the bounce it got in the polls.  Stating that one is against the property tax is the populist thing to do.  I am disappointed by Fianna F\u00e1il reverting to type but that is what it has done.<\/p><p>Sinn F\u00e9in's position on this matter is completely hypocritical.  In Northern Ireland, people are obliged to pay a multiple of what it is proposed people in this jurisdiction should pay.  I accept that some additional services are provided out of the money paid by our neighbours in the North.  I am trying to be fair about this issue.  Some 16 or 17 OECD countries have property taxes.  A property tax is a wealth tax.  If one examines the figures provide by the Department of Finance in respect of the budget, one will discover that capital gains tax and capital gains tax bring in of the order of \u20ac750 million.  The property tax will bring in \u20ac500 million.  This means that a total of \u20ac1.25 billion will be collected in wealth taxes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900054#CCC00800","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355942100,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I will not be using all of the time available to me because I am losing my voice.

I wish to make two points, one of which is general in nature while the other is specific.  A property tax does not sit easy with people, in fact no tax does so.  However, I welcome the way the property tax is structured.  I also welcome the way in which the Minister outlined it to the House.  I will be supporting the Bill because I cannot, with easy conscience, argue against specific cuts to social welfare and then argue against this measure, which is designed to raise revenue.  I am very cognisant of the fact that revenue must be raised.  I would prefer it if we were not obliged to introduce any further taxes but I am of the view that the approach the Minister is taking in respect of this tax is fair.<\/p><p>Before making the specific point to which I have already alluded, I wish to make a declaration of interest in that I am a director of the Irish Girl Guides Trust Corporation Limited.  It was in the latter role that I became aware of the issue I wish to raise.  The Irish Girl Guides Trust - like many other children's and youth organisations - holds properties it uses for activities relating to children's and youth activities.  These are held on a non-residential and non-commercial basis.  Girl guides would go and spend weekends away at the type of properties to which I refer.  They are charged very low fees for their stay because no profits are made.  Most of the properties in question are in need of serious investment and repair.  The property tax could place many of them in a precarious position.<\/p><p>I have tabled an amendment for Committee Stage in respect of this matter but I wanted to take the opportunity to raise it now in order that the Minister might have time to consider it.  I can supply to him a list of the properties owned by the Irish Girl Guides Trust Corporation Limited.  I am aware that other children's and youth organisations will be in a similar situation to the Irish Girl Guides.

One of the matters with which I wish to deal is whether this is a local property tax or just a property tax.  To provide some background and as most Senators are aware, there were property taxes in this country in the 1970s.  From the 1960s onward, however, there was a trend towards sucking all responsibility at local level into what over the years has become Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This was not just done by Fianna F\u00e1il Governments but a Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition actually removed local domestic rates in the 1970s.  One of the difficulties with such rates in the 1970s was that they were a specifically urban charge and did not apply in rural areas.  I remind Senators that income tax did not apply to a large part of the urban community in the 1970s either.  There is a bad history with regard to local taxation in this country.  The impact of this is that there is no real relationship between local services and taxation.  This is because we levy taxation and make provision for local services centrally.<\/p><p>My second point is that there has been too much control at local level and this is because funding for local authorities comes from central government.  The worst impact in this regard was felt during the era of the Celtic tiger, when poorer local authorities which could not raise money by levying commercial rates did so by imposing levies on developers.  They also granted planning permissions in respect of areas in which such permissions should never have been forthcoming.  We are dealing with the consequences of this today.  What I am stating here, in very broad terms, is that I favour local taxation for local service provision.  There are many benefits to be gained in this regard, particularly in the context of local democracy.<\/p><p>There are a number of other issues which arise.  Successive commissions on taxation have advocated a broadening of the tax base.  Our tax base has been acknowledged as being too narrow.  Even if the troika had never said so, the reality is that the imposition of a property tax should have been considered before now.  The fact remains that our experiences in attempting to deal with property taxes have, to date, been extremely poor.  Some 75% of the income from the most recent property tax came from the greater Dublin area.  I take issue, therefore, with his contention that this is not an urban tax.  Richer people obviously own more valuable properties.  As a result, they will pay more money in property tax.  It is more difficult to hide a building or a parcel of land than it is to hide money in foreign tax shelters, etc.  The property tax is, therefore, a better way of ensuring that we are levying moneys from those who can afford to pay.<\/p><p>I would urge caution in respect of a number of issues.  The first of these relates to the need to be aware of the unintended consequences of the measure before the House.  There has been a slight recovery in the property market recently but the reality is that everyone is suffering as a result of the fact that said market is actually defunct.  I do not just refer here to couples with three children who are trapped in two-bed apartments and who need to moved, I am talking about the fact that any healthy economy needs a functioning property market.  The Minister must be conscious of the fact that this measure may have a significant impact in the context of damping down an recovery in the property market.<\/p><p>The second issue which arises in this regard relates to the need to take account of the effect of this measure on aspects of the market.  I refer, in particular, to the private rented sector.  As I have indicated on many previous occasions, one in five families live in houses or apartments that are rented from landlords.  It is a well known fact that more of these properties - in which real people live - are in negative equity and are distressed than is the case with properties in any other sector.  I am of the view that a number of the measures introduced in or as a result of the budget - I include the Bill before the House in this regard - are going to have a negative impact on this sector of the market.  The Minister must be aware of that fact.<\/p><p>On the main aspects of the Bill, questions arise in the context of the urban-rural issue.  This is an important matter and no one should be fobbed off in respect of it.  Property values in Dublin, Cork and Galway are higher than in other parts of the country.  Ordinary families in these cities are obliged to pay out more of their disposable income in respect of maintaining their homes.  These people could go to the cinema and do many other things if they were not obliged to spend their money keeping a roof over their heads.  I do not agree that because people own properties which are more valuable, this should have any impact whatsoever on the services they receive at local level.  This is a matter which will have to be addressed, perhaps not today or tomorrow but certainly in time.<\/p><p>As Senator Darragh O'Brien stated, no allowance has been made for the fact that many people live in apartments which they bought during the boom and in respect of which they are paying significant service charges.  These individuals are actually already paying for some of the services which local authorities are, in theory, supposed to be supplying.  I am surprised that more of those who live in apartments do not request that common areas be taken into charge by their local authorities.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout referred to the impact of the Bill on local authorities and voluntary housing associations.  I am at a loss when it comes to gauging how the latter are going to be affected.  I accept that the legislation refers to the chargeable value and that the word &quot;unencumbered&quot; is used.  Research has been carried out by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government - I am sure the Minister's Department has carried out such research - by Indecon and others which indicates that, as a result of a number of factors, it is practically impossible to determine the value of local authority properties.  The factors to which I refer include tenants' security of tenure, successor tenancy rights and, in the past, the entitlement to purchase.<\/p> <p>This will require serious consideration.  <\/p><p>As the Minister is well aware, the Government is placing a significant burden on the voluntary housing association sector to house people who are in most need because we no longer have local authority housing provision.  That is not the way we see ourselves providing housing, certainly in the short term, given the financial difficulties in which we find ourselves.  There is no doubt in my mind that Respond!, the largest housing association in the country with 6,000 units, and Cl\u00faid which has a significant number of units not far off that figure, are not in a position to come up with this money.  It is facetious to say they can turn around and get it from their tenants, some of whom are among the poorest people in the country.  Some measure needs to be found to deal with this issue, both for local authorities and the voluntary housing association sector.<\/p><p>The stamp duty issue is very difficult.  I am a solicitor and was in professional practice a number of years ago.  I am very conscious of the fact that people paid very significant prices for property during the Celtic tiger years.  The bottom line is that stamp duty is a tax, yet we are asking the people concerned to pay once again.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to alleviating the distress of those who paid very significant amounts of money to the Exchequer in stamp duty.  I understand local charges are a better way and I ask him to take this into account in stamp duty legislation.  We must reduce stamp duty to a nominal level, given that we are imposing local taxes.<\/p><p>We are a nation of home owners.  I do not want to bore Members with statistics, but significant research by people such as Professor Tony Fahey and the ESRI shows that older people suffer less in old age in terms of poverty because they own their own homes.  It is a fact that poor people are more asset wealthy than their incomes would suggest.  Home ownership has been a serious income redistribution factor.  I know the Minister has made allowances in the legislation for deferral and so on, but my experience of dealing with older people is that they are very cautious, very worried about the future and providing for themselves if they need care and so on.  I am very concerned - I ask the Minister to keep this under review - about the impact this measure will have on them.<\/p><p>In general, a property tax is necessary.  I take on board the figure of 15% allowable either way, while there is provision to pay into the local government fund an amount equivalent to local property tax.  I live in D\u00fan Laoghaire.  Will the property tax raised there come back to it?  How much of it will come back to it?  What is the relationship between how much I will pay and how much my local authority will receive?  I do not think 15% one way or the other will make an essential difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900055#DDD00800","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355942700,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I compliment Senator Aideen Hayden on her splendid analytic speech.  She made a number of the points I would have made.  Underneath the velvet tones of the Minister's speech, there was steely language.  He stated: \"There will be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owner in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the property\" and \"This is equitable to the extent that market value provides a measure of the value of a residential property to the owner, particularly in terms of its proximity to places of work and local amenities and facilities\".  Home is a central element of Irish culture.  We value and treasure our homes, not just for their market value, which is variable.  It seems there is callousness in what the Minister said.<\/p><p>There are some aspects of the content of the Bill that I welcome.  It is a very good move that residential accommodation for people with special needs will be exempt.  I am also very pleased that the Minister has taken on board the issue of pyritous materials first debated in the Seanad when I raised the issue.  It seemed to be totally unjust to extract money from people who could not live in their own houses in certain circumstances.  Certainly, their value has gone down the drain.<\/p><p>I wonder about the idea of making executors liable.  This may have the effect of deterring people from becoming executors, if they believe they are putting themselves in danger.  <\/p><p>It is welcome that the Minister has indicated that he is prepared to listen to constructive suggestions.  It is important that we have the Minister for Finance, a very busy man with an onerous job, in the Seanad.  <\/p><p>How does one assess the value of a house?  It is very difficult these days, particularly outside newly built estates where the houses are all the same.  They tend to change over time as people modify them or add an extension and so forth.  There is also the question of the price the house commands on the date of its sale, particularly if it is an individual house.  For example, a house that was sold through an advertisement or at auction, at which there was only one bidder might be valued at \u20ac500,000.  If there are two bidders, it can reach astonishing levels.  Which is the real value and how will it be assessed?  Of course, there will be annual changes in the value of currency and so on.  I accept that a property tax is a good idea if the money goes to the local authorities, but even then, in many local authorities and certainly in Dublin, many of the services that used to be provided by local authorities are no longer provided by them because they have been privatised, for example, bin collection services.  The private companies have made a complete bags of that service.  Water services will be privatised.  Therefore, what services will be provided by local authorities?  We are entitled to a bang for our buck and it will be a high one.  These questions needs to be answered.<\/p><p>The principal reason I wish to speak to the Bill is to raise the issue of listed buildings.  It is very important that we respect our heritage.  If one looks at the very small number of significant houses on their own parkland such as Birr Castle, Glin Castle, Castle Leslie and Westport House, they will go if they are hit by the property tax, which would be a very serious blow.  There will be no point in crying after they have been detenanted and the roofs have fallen off.  I also must declare a direct and personal interest in listed buildings.  In 1978 I bought a semi-derelict house in North Great George's Street which was then a slum area, with the lower end unravelled.  In June 1979 I started the North Great George's Street Preservation Society which is now under the chairmanship of Ms Muireann Noonan, an adornment to the clan, although she spells her name slightly differently.  Under her guidance, we won the national pride of place competition.  It was an extraordinary change from being a tenement area of semi-derelict houses.  The James Joyce Centre, No. 35, which has been assisted recently by the Government has become a very significant tourist attraction.  Our visitor numbers are up 10% this year in the middle of the financial fire storm.  During the 35 years I have lived in the house I restored it at my own expenses and did one room a year, which is what I was able to afford.  That was good because it meant the adventure and excitement of restoration continued over that period and at the end of a year I had a new achievement.  The last room was done about three years ago as a result of the fact that I had made a donation of all my papers to the National Library of Ireland, which freed up the room in which I had dispersed them all over the place.  I have spent well over \u20ac1 million, possibly \u20ac2 million, during the years.  It is amazing the way it mounts up.  One operation alone cost me nearly \u20ac300,000.<\/p> <p>I was glad to pay it.  I provided employment.  I restored a building that was at risk.  It seems we are travelling backwards in this country.  I have instanced various things such as evictions, soup kitchens and so on but now we have what one could say is rack-renting.  If the unfortunate peasants dared to improve their holdings in the old days, they were given a slap by the landlord and charged for the improvements.  <\/p><p>I bought my house in 1978 for the price a three or four bed-roomed semi-detached house in the suburbs at the time.  How do I value it now given the money I have spent on it?  Do I value it at the equivalent of that or with all the improvements I have made to it?  I might be able to survive in this respect but there are people living on my street who will not.  I dread to see that beautiful street sliding back into dereliction.  <\/p><p>There are other considerations as well.  For example, many people have let out parts of their houses.  I have put in a luxury flat in the basement of my house, which has stabilised the house and I paid the property tax on both parts, because one had to do so.  I assume the same requirement will apply to the payment of the property tax.  That might bring me in underneath the threshold.  I suggested to my neighbours that we get together and decide what are the appropriate valuations not to cheat the system but rather to establish what is the correct valuation.  It is difficult to establish that with these houses as they are all different.  Some of them are two-bay and some are three-bay.  Around the corner in Mountjoy Square two houses, one in good order and the other not in good in order, were sold together for \u20ac670,000 and dividing that figure by two, perhaps the value of my house will come in under \u20ac1 million.<\/p><p>It is almost shameful to make any kind of special case, particularly when we have just been dealing with carers.  I will do everything I can to pay whatever tax is exacted from me, and I know my neighbours will as well, but it would be a real shame if, in pursuit of some kind of fiscal rectitude, we destroyed our heritage.  This is a savage Bill, let nobody make any mistake about that.  The household tax was not collected by the Revenue Commissioners and non-payment of it was not a bar to membership of either House but because a tax clearance certificate will not be issued unless the property tax is paid, it means that the kind of protest in which some of our colleagues in the other House engaged will be completely impossible, and that poses certain questions.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister.  He has a very keen mind and I hope he will take on board some of the things I said.  I apologise if what I said appears to be selfish.  I am not thinking only of myself.  I think in particular of the work that was done, which was very unpopular, by people like Desmond Guinness in preserving our heritage.  All the glorious work in this Chamber is not an expression of an alien culture.  This was done by Michael Stapleton, whose two sons went to Clongowes Wood College in the 18th century.  This is Irish craftsmanship and it is unique and distinctive.

It is a positive measure in that we will have a more sustainable tax base in the future.  We can look back on how spending increased from 2002 to 2007 and beyond that.  When the bottom fell out of the property market we were dependent entirely on revenue from VAT and income tax and we know what a vulnerable position we were in.  Putting a value-based property tax in place is important for a sustainable future.  The OECD, the Commission on Taxation and the ESRI all agree that property tax is less harmful to the economy than any other forms of taxation, particularly taxation on income earned from employment.  The objective is to keep tax on income as low as possible.<\/p><p>  I am slightly concerned about the market valuation of city properties that will be considered in this respect.  There has been considerable discussion about those living in higher valued properties, particularly in cities, although in many instances that may not be the case.  The situation has evolved where the market reflects those properties have a higher value now.  Many people will never realise the value of their property.  Usually they will sell their property and move to a property within a similar market and value of their property will not confer an advantage unless they opt for the rural resettlement programme.  The value of their property will be an asset that could be used as collateral or an asset in their estate but most people do not realise the value of their property.  <\/p><p>  Thee is a concern about the rural-urban divide in this context.  When I was a representative of Cork City Council and Cork County Council there was a debate on the large rate base for the county which was in around the city and much of that money was not spent where the local authority members perceived it should have been spent.  It was spent in the western part of the county in developing tourism and roads - Cork being one of the largest counties. <\/p><p>  As city dweller, I recognise that some of the taxation from this measure that will be raised locally will be used nationally.  Some of it will have to be spent to support other issues such as developing tourism, beaches and marine areas which we like to visit.  There is a great deal of concern in local authorities as they do not know what proportion of the tax collected in their area they will be allocated.  I ask the Minister to convey that concern to the powers that be, particularly the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who will be making these decisions.  This is an important consideration.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise the issue of rents, which Senator Hayden mentioned.  I note from the property website <i>Daft.ie<\/i> and local reports that the value of a three-bedroomed, semi-detached house in my area varies from &#8364;375,000 to &#8364;400,000.  That value will be passed on to tenants.  A large number of mortgage holders are in distress and a third of landlords are in mortgage arrears.  As a State we very much depend on the rental property and as solution to our housing problems.  There is a balance in that respect and that needs to be recognised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900057#FFF01100","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1355943300,"counter":767,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Clune for sharing her time.

They maintain them by keeping them warm and in many instances that is a huge ongoing cost.  They maintain the grounds and in many cases they allow their homes to be visited by members of the public who are interested in the architecture and culture of the homes.

Average property sale prices in Meath East in 2012, according to <i>propertypriceregister.ie<\/i> puts Dunboyne in the top 13% nationwide.  The same applies to Ratoath, Ashbourne and Stamullen, which are in the top 20% nationally.  I have used the same figures as the Government from the residential property price register, the Thornhill report and the ESRI report.  Those people are among the most heavily indebted in the country in terms of mortgages.  Many paid significant amounts of stamp duty.  They do not receive the services from local authorities they got in Dublin, if they used to live there, or the services they might get in an urban district council area.  I refer to street cleaning or the council cutting grass in estates.  Many feel they get no services at all.  The average homeowner in Dunboyne or Ratoath will pay just under &#8364;500 a year in property tax.  That is blatant unfairness when similar properties in Longford and Roscommon will pay one fifth of that sum.  The Minister is overestimating the capacity of middle Ireland to take any more of the property tax.  It is being rammed through the D\u00e1il and Seanad without any consideration of how it will affect people.  People will not pay the tax if they are not getting the services for it.  They will not pay the tax if they are paying five times more than a similar property in a different county.  It is simply unfair.<\/p><p>  At least a site value tax, which Fianna F\u00e1il signed up to but which we think is inappropriate in the current economic circumstances, is a different tax.  Owners of zoned residential land, of which there is plenty in County Meath, would be liable for a site value tax but they are exempt from the property tax.  There is nothing for homeowners struggling under the weight of heavy mortgages.  A property tax is fair if it is a wealth tax but this is not a wealth tax because most of the people are in negative wealth.  The value of their loan is higher than the value of their property.  It is unfair and the Government is underestimating these people's resistance and their capacity to protest.  They will have the capacity to protest when the bills start coming through.  This is middle Ireland and they cannot take any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900058#GGG00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1355943900,"counter":781,"content":"<p>T\u00e1 m\u00e9 bu\u00edoch don Seanad\u00f3ir Byrne as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  This property tax is simply coming at the wrong time.  It is not taking into consideration the ability of individuals to pay.  Members have spoken about those who paid stamp duty, particularly over the past ten years.  Many people paid substantial sums over the past ten years amounting to \u20ac5 billion in total.  People also paid local authority service charges up to \u20ac20,000 and they are not being taken into account.  When 25% of all mortgage holders in the country are struggling to some extent to meet their mortgage repayments, it is madness to bring in a property tax.  The troika is not forcing us to do is, despite what has been said.  We can substitute one budgetary measure for another as long as we make meet the figure of \u20ac3.5 billion.  The troika has continually made the point in meetings with Fianna F\u00e1il.<\/p><p>I refer to the proposed exemptions.  Fianna F\u00e1il is totally opposed to the legislation as currently formulated because it will drive into poverty those with property and those struggling in the middle-income brackets.  I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, say handing over powers to the Revenue Commissioner would be efficient.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, said the same thing in the D\u00e1il.  It will effectively criminalise people.  Fines are included in the Bill.  The Revenue Commissioners have sweeping powers and will now be given those sweeping powers over homeowners and families.  That will cause mayhem and havoc, particularly if a young person has a taxi business and seeks a tax clearance certificate to renew a licence.  If the person has not paid the property tax and is incurring interest, the person will effectively be out of a job.<\/p><p>I have read the exemptions but it is not clear from the legislation or the explanatory memorandum whether NAMA properties are exempt.  I assume they are not exempt as it would be crazy if NAMA properties were exempt while people in council houses must pay the tax.<\/p><p>Lifting moneys out of social welfare payments and payments from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is wrong.  We spoke earlier about the Social Welfare Bill.  This measure will cut social welfare payments further because it penalises people in receipt of them.  An example concerns a four-bedroomed property sold at auction in a prime location in County Donegal for \u20ac40,000.  What happens if owners living on the same street believe the sale value is \u20ac40,000 but Revenue catches up in five or six years' time, when the market recovers, and the owners are caught for additional taxation measures?<\/p><p>We must be clear where this is going.  This will cause more difficulty than the Government anticipates.  It will drive the property market into decline and have irrefutable consequences for the recovery of the country.  I know that from speaking to people in the property business and people living in ordinary family homes.  It is the wrong time for the measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900058#GGG00300","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1355943900,"counter":782,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I agree in principle with the application of property tax in Ireland because nearly all developed countries have some form of property tax.  It is an internationally accepted way of funding local services.  I will refer to the application of funding of local services later.<\/p><p>A local property tax is a steady source of income for local authorities in most countries.  The introduction of a property tax is in compliance with the memorandum of understanding of the EU-IMF programme.  It is part of a number of measures being brought forward by the Government.  The introduction of the tax is an opportunity for real political reform at local level.  Local property tax will provide a stable funding base for the local authority sector.  It is an introduction and we must crawl before we walk.  We must start somewhere and we cannot implement all the measures we would like on the first day.  It is a reform at the level of local government.  It will strongly reinforce local democracy and decision-making and encourage greater efficiency by local authorities on behalf of their electorates.  Not everything will happen on the first day.  <\/p><p>A notable feature of the Irish taxation system in recent decades has been the absence of a residential property tax.  I will not go over the comments of Senator Hayden on the history of rates.  The flat charge of \u20ac100, regardless of the value of the property, was a blunt instrument and an unfair application of property tax.  It had to be implemented temporarily to try to redress the appalling financial situation.  Any attempt to say this was a fair way of implementing a property tax is not real.<\/p><p>There is a property tax in the North of the island.  I am usually shouted down when I say that because I am not comparing like with like.  In addition to the tax levels in the North, there was a 10% increase this year.  In Derry, a house worth \u20ac200,000 will pay \u00a31,500 and a house worth \u20ac200,000 in Ireland will pay \u20ac315.  We are comparing like with like because my analysis takes into consideration different services.  Members have pointed out that some services are free while others are not.<\/p><p>Local authority houses also pay domestic rates in Northern Ireland.  Members have said that, given the integration of local authority houses in private estates, there is a circulation of money.  We can look at it that way but local authorities also rent houses in private estates.  We have encouraged that to ensure integration of people in various estates.<\/p> <p>It is also the case in apartment blocks, including very nice ones.  This is appropriate because local authority tenants are entitled to the best of accommodation.  It would be very unfair if a very low-income earner struggling to pay a mortgage and in negative equity was not funded while another individual, earning nearly the same amount, was funded.  It is a question of fairness for all.  The scope of the tax system must be as wide as possible in so far as it brings itself to bear on property owners.  The Minister listed the exemptions.  I will not repeat them; suffice it to say the provision on pyrite is very welcome.  I thank the Minister of State therefor.<\/p><p>We cannot continue to spend money we have not got but we must get money somewhere.  The budget is widening the tax base.  Property remains the primary source of wealth in the country.  Importantly, it is immobile and cannot be transferred out of the State.  When raising income, one must ensure one protects jobs.  Every other country in Europe has a property tax because property cannot be moved abroad.  Ordinarily, cash can be transferred abroad with the press of a button on a computer.  We now know what the deficit is.  The property tax is a responsible way to raise money, particularly for local services.  It is less harmful to the economy than certain other measures.<\/p><p>Senator Norris referred to protected houses.  He mentioned Castle Leslie, a lovely castle and commercial property that hosts weddings, etc.  The issue raised by the Senator would have to be considered seriously.  One protected property is not equal to another.  Those with protected properties who cannot afford to pay the tax will be able to avail of the deferral arrangement, at an annual interest rate of 4%.<\/p><p>Protected properties owned by local authorities should be subject to an exemption.  Some could be very pricey.  Former councillor Stanley Laing and I have been working hard in respect of Templeogue House in Dublin 6.  It has a high value.  There are other properties around the country owned by local authorities.  Templeogue House is a protected structure and there are those who are trying to save it.  There are other such buildings around the country in respect of which the tax burden should not be placed on local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900058#GGG00400","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355944500,"counter":784,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, as always.<\/p><p>My ever-active research assistant took out the document issued by the IMF today at 5.10 p.m.  In contains material in which we state we are introducing the tax on 1 July 2013 and that it will be collected centrally by the Revenue Commissioners and constitute an important and stable source of revenue.

Taxation accounts for 44% of GNP while the OECD average is 41.9%.  We might have had a low-tax economy in the past but the property tax is on top of an already heavily taxed population.  The myth that we have a low-tax economy should be debunked.  It might be nice if one's corporation tax rate is 12.5% but the rest of us live in a high-tax country.  The problem is that we are spending 55.5% of GNP whereas the OECD average is 45% and the OECD-EU average, including Scandinavia, is 47.6%.<\/p><p>The problem with the agreement in the documents of April 2011 is that we are increasing taxation in the period of the rescue from \u20ac34 billion to \u20ac44 billion while expenditure on the current side stays at approximately \u20ac48 billion.  Too much of the adjustment has been achieved through taxation.  The property tax continues in this vein in the belief that Ireland is a low-tax country.  While the Minister of State does not believe this, many commentators do.<\/p><p>Rates are being reintroduced in an already heavily taxed country.  They had been abolished on a revenue-neutral basis because all the other taxes rose.  There were some benefits.  The Minister of State is too young to recall that the de-roofed properties all along the west coast were the result of rates.  Taking them off resulted in a higher standard of housing.  The abolition of rates was not at the expense of the Department of Finance because the other taxes were raised.<\/p><p>With regard to the once-off taxes that people pay, the Minister was very tough.  This matter must be taken into account.  The fault with the once-off taxes, such as stamp duty, a property tax, is that the Department of Finance did not distinguish between once-off revenue and recurring revenue.  It spent it all.  It is dangerous to tell a person who paid tens of thousands of euro on stamp duty that he or she did not pay any property tax and is liable.  It shows that when dealing with the Government, one never wins.  If one pays taxes up front, it will be back to collect more.  That must be addressed.<\/p><p>The problem with house prices in general is determining the actual value.  All the Senators who have spoken have identified this issue.  Our property prices are kept up by NAMA, by not putting 83,000 ghost estate houses on the market and by forbearance.  If we freed up the market, the real price of property might be 30% lower.  The ESRI or some such body should be asked the real value.  Homeowners, who have already been subject to tax increases, now must pay the property tax because the Government is propping up the price of property in order to make banks look a bit better.<\/p><p>We must consider the issue of inability to pay.  I refer in particular to older people.  For them, the value is pretty much irrelevant.  To use one of the phrases of the Minister for Finance, if a &quot;deranged banker&quot; buys a house near one, must one pay more property tax?  There are plenty of deranged bankers.  The phrase &quot;deranged banker&quot; was used by the Minister when he was addressing the finance committee.<\/p><p>What about the Dunboyne factor mentioned by Senator Byrne?  There will be areas in which locals will not be able to live because spillover incomes from people moving in will ramp up their tax burden.  The locals have not got any extra income.  Perhaps the local shopkeeper or another individual may benefit a little but we must account for the fact that events that have nothing to do with an individual's ability to pay could dramatically increase his or her liability to the tax, irrespective of whether a deranged banker or another individual moves into a property down the road with an inflated price.  There would be no increase in the income of anybody else but, under this tax, he or she would be liable.<\/p><p>Consider the circumstances if one must sell one's house to pay the tax.  A house is not just the building one sells to pay the tax to the Revenue Commissioners; it is also a link to schools, neighbours, community facilities, the parish, the community and the GAA.  This must be taken into account.  There would be serious losses of welfare if people had to break all these connections.  A house is not just a building on which the Revenue Commissioners put a value.<\/p><p>On what will local authorities spend the property tax revenue?  Responsibility for roads has been transferred to the NRA, and responsibility for health to the HSE.  Waste collection is now the responsibility of the private sector, responsibility for water services is being transferred to NewERA and responsibility for higher education grants is being transferred to SUSI - Lord between us and all harm.  If local authorities are not doing anything, why should there be a tax to support them?  I take into account the fact that residents mow their own grass and pay private companies to remove their rubbish.  Many live in apartments with service charges.

We are not solving our mortgage problem.  To bring in a property tax now without having solved the mortgage crisis, and it is a growing crisis, is a crazy move by any Government.  We have 29% of borrowers in difficulty.  They are either in arrears or have rearranged their loans.

The Government's proposals for a property tax will hit struggling home owners at a time when they can least afford it.  Now is simply not the time to inflict a property tax on a struggling economy, a weak housing market and home owners working to make ends meet.  Not only can people not afford the tax, but the tax will only suffocate further a property market that is on its knees, reduce domestic spending and damage the economy.  Elderly people living in properties they worked hard to own and in which to raise a family are being driven out of that same home by an onerous tax.  The domestic economy is in a fragile state.  The most recent Irish League of Credit Unions survey indicates that half of all adults are struggling to pay their bills on time.  Some 42% of consumers have had to borrow money to pay bills in the past 12 months and only three out of ten are able to save any money at the end of the month.  <\/p><p>I believe Fianna F\u00e1il made a serious mistake in 1977 in its controversial budget when it removed rates on houses.  It was a crazy decision as local authorities need money to provide services.  The problem is that the people are not confident that the money will be put into the local authority and utilised properly.  Fianna F\u00e1il was remiss in not introducing a water charge.

It then goes on to mention the property tax.  Before doing that it states that the average income for the top 20% of households is more than five times the average income of the poorest 20% of households.  This means that for a budgetary package to impose an equal percentage burden on each group, for every \u20ac50 million taken from the lowest income group, a further \u20ac250 million would need to be raised in taxes or benefit reductions from the top income group.  The Government failed to take even a cent from the top earners through income tax.  That clear choice was avoided and instead the Government has gone for an unfair, unjust, regressive property tax.<\/p><p>The ESRI refers to the options open to the Government for dealing with low income families which included the option of deferral and income related reliefs.  It stated that income-related reliefs was a better and fairer option as comparisons were made with other countries across Europe which showed that income related reliefs, rather than deferrals, was the best way to protect low income families, especially as the Government is about to charge such families 4% interest because they simply do not have the money to pay for the family home tax. <\/p><p>I agree with Senator John Crown that one should go back to the starting point as to why we pay taxes.  This is a tax.  We pay taxes for the provision of services.  For me, the principle of taxation is that it would be fair and progressive.  How can anybody say that a family home tax which is based on the value of a property which is not linked to ability to pay is fair, where the combined income going into one house could be \u20ac250,000 per year and that family will pay \u20ac316 per year on average while a family with a total income of \u20ac80,000 will pay exactly the same amount?  That means that low income families will pay the same amount as high income families unless those high income families live in mansions, of which there are very few.  <\/p><p>It is interesting to note that when we speak about imposing a wealth tax we are told there is no wealth in the country and that such a tax cannot be imposed.  Yet the same Labour Party and Fine Gael Senators say it was a victory that a mansion tax was included in the budget and that this would tax wealth.  They also said it would take \u20ac500 million from wealth but when costed the take is only a fraction of that amount.  One cannot say this tax is fair.  Essentially, it is tax on the roof over a person's head.<\/p><p>Comparisons were made with the North.  The rates in the North are too high and I would prefer if they were lower.

The Government's proposals for a property tax will hit struggling home owners at a time when they can least afford it.  Now is simply not the time to inflict a property tax on a struggling economy, a weak housing market and home owners working to make ends meet.  Not only can people not afford the tax, but the tax will only suffocate further a property market that is on its knees, reduce domestic spending and damage the economy.  Elderly people living in properties they worked hard to own and in which to raise a family are being driven out of that same home by an onerous tax.  The domestic economy is in a fragile state.  The most recent Irish League of Credit Unions survey indicates that half of all adults are struggling to pay their bills on time.  Some 42% of consumers have had to borrow money to pay bills in the past 12 months and only three out of ten are able to save any money at the end of the month.  <\/p><p>I believe Fianna F\u00e1il made a serious mistake in 1977 in its controversial budget when it removed rates on houses.  It was a crazy decision as local authorities need money to provide services.  The problem is that the people are not confident that the money will be put into the local authority and utilised properly.  Fianna F\u00e1il was remiss in not introducing a water charge.  I do not have a problem with privatising the water service.  <\/p><p>There is something seriously wrong with the Fine Gael culture of not touching income tax.

It breaks the income household brackets into three broad areas - low income families and individuals; middle income families and individuals and high income families and individuals and comments on the last six austerity budgets.  In respect of this budget, the lowest income earners in the State saw their net income, according to the ESRI, drop by more than 1%.

It then goes on to mention the property tax.  Before doing that it states that the average income for the top 20% of households is more than five times the average income of the poorest 20% of households.  This means that for a budgetary package to impose an equal percentage burden on each group, for every \u20ac50 million taken from the lowest income group, a further \u20ac250 million would need to be raised in taxes or benefit reductions from the top income group.  The Government failed to take even a cent from the top earners through income tax.  That clear choice was avoided and instead the Government has gone for an unfair, unjust, regressive property tax.<\/p><p>The ESRI refers to the options open to the Government for dealing with low income families which included the option of deferral and income related reliefs.  It stated that income-related reliefs was a better and fairer option as comparisons were made with other countries across Europe which showed that income related reliefs, rather than deferrals, was the best way to protect low income families, especially as the Government is about to charge such families 4% interest because they simply do not have the money to pay for the family home tax. <\/p><p>I agree with Senator John Crown that one should go back to the starting point as to why we pay taxes.  This is a tax.  We pay taxes for the provision of services.  For me, the principle of taxation is that it would be fair and progressive.  How can anybody say that a family home tax which is based on the value of a property which is not linked to ability to pay is fair, where the combined income going into one house could be \u20ac250,000 per year and that family will pay \u20ac316 per year on average while a family with a total income of \u20ac80,000 will pay exactly the same amount?  That means that low income families will pay the same amount as high income families unless those high income families live in mansions, of which there are very few.  <\/p><p>It is interesting to note that when we speak about imposing a wealth tax we are told there is no wealth in the country and that such a tax cannot be imposed.  Yet the same Labour Party and Fine Gael Senators say it was a victory that a mansion tax was included in the budget and that this would tax wealth.  They also said it would take \u20ac500 million from wealth but when costed the take is only a fraction of that amount.  One cannot say this tax is fair.  Essentially, it is tax on the roof over a person's head.<\/p><p>Comparisons were made with the North.  The rates in the North are too high and I would prefer if they were lower.  I would like to have the taxation powers in the Assembly to enable us make the choices we would want to make.

Tax is based on real market value.  The point has been made by my friends in Fianna F\u00e1il that it is the wrong time at the wrong economic juncture, irrespective of whether it is a site or market valuation.  The bottom line is that in the original memorandum between Fianna F\u00e1il and the Troika, the former suggested a tax of &#8364;550 million could be obtained in the first year of implementation.  We suggest the tax should be &#8364;500 million, which is below that target.  Whether site or market valuation is used, the net issue is how much will be brought in.  We will bring in less than Fianna F\u00e1il suggested notwithstanding the promise they made previously.<\/p><p>  My good friends in Sinn F\u00e9in have made a number of suggestions this evening.  First, they suggest Northern Ireland should have full control of fiscal powers.  It is a good idea.  I am sure the taxpayers of Herefordshire and Gloucester would like to know that when they hand full power on taxation measures to the Northern Ireland Executive the little cheque that comes to the mantlepiece every month to make up the difference between tax and revenue will be put to one side.  Of course, no one is suggesting that.  In reality, the English taxpayer foots the bill in Northern Ireland week in, week out to make up the difference between income and expenditure.  We do not plan to do it any time soon as we do not have the resources.  Sinn F\u00e9in has been caught red-handed on this issue.  Throughout Northern Ireland, where Sinn F\u00e9in is in government nationally and locally, close to &#8364;1,000 per annum is paid by homeowners.  That is rightly so as Sinn F\u00e9in has recognised that one must have a broadly based taxation system.  On the passing of the Bill, which I do not assume, the question for Sinn F\u00e9in is whether they will suggest to the electorate as it did last year that people should not pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900063#MMM00600","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355946900,"counter":857,"content":"<p>We did not suggest that last year, to be fair.

We know from recent history that Sinn F\u00e9in was against the increase in VAT from 21% to 23%, which brought in &#8364;750 million.  When I looked to see if this year it was suggesting revoking that increase, no such suggestion could be seen.  Sinn F\u00e9in at the last election said it would abolish the universal social charge.  At its last Ard-Fheis, the man without a plan from Donegal said he was also going to abolish the universal social charge.  On its first Private Members' motion in the D\u00e1il, Sinn F\u00e9in proposed to abolish the universal social charge.  However, when I looked for the plan in its pre-budget submission to knock out &#8364;4.5 billion by universal social charge, I could not find it.  The voters need to know if Sinn F\u00e9in is going to abolish this measure.  That is the real test.<\/p><p>  I agree with Senator Barrett that this has become a high taxation economy.  Of the adjustment since 2008, 60% has been by way of tax increases, not by reductions in expenditure.  I agree with Senator Walsh in that regard.  Thus far shalt thou go and no further, as Parnell once said.  The top marginal rate of 41% is not 41% but is effectively 52% when the 7% universal social charge and 4% PRSI rates are included.  I encourage colleagues to consider Annex F in the statement of the Minister for Finance to both Houses which sets out how progressive our taxation system has become since 2008.  It was not progressive up to that point.  We now have a system in which the top 10% of income earners pay 60% of all tax.  The 70% of people on incomes of &#8364;50,000 or less pay 19% of all tax.

To take up the suggestion made by my colleagues in Sinn F\u00e9in, if ever there was an example of a wealth tax, it is the property tax.  Sinn F\u00e9in has claimed it would raise \u20ac800 million in year one of its proposed wealth tax.  Next year it will be difficult enough to raise \u20ac250 million with all of the protests and the rest of it that will follow.  Last year Deputy Pearse Doherty asked the Minister for Finance how much a French-type wealth tax would yield, as proposed by the then French presidential candidate Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.  The Minister, honest man that he is, replied that it would yield somewhere between \u20ac400 million and \u20ac500 million.  When Fran\u00e7ois Hollande got into office, he did not even introduce his proposed wealth tax, while overnight Sinn F\u00e9in simply doubled the numbers to \u20ac800 million on the basis of a reply to a parliamentary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900063#MMM00800","speaker":"958","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355947500,"counter":860,"content":"<\/a> <p>Why will the Government not cost the proposal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900064#NNN00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355947500,"counter":861,"content":"<\/a> <p>That is not the way-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900064#NNN00300","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355947500,"counter":862,"content":"<\/a> <p>The Minister should give us the figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900064#NNN00400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355947500,"counter":863,"content":"<\/a> <p>The Minister of State to continue, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900064#NNN00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1355947500,"counter":864,"content":"<\/a> <p>The Government refused to cost it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900064#NNN00700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1355947500,"counter":865,"content":"<\/a> <p>I would love Sinn F\u00e9in to set out how much of the \u20ac800 million would be raised from property, shares and income outside the country.

We have reached the point where 42% of all our taxes are on the income side.  There is very little additional room to give.  That is why the Government, unfortunately, had to introduce this tax.  We recognise that it will be an imposition, particular for those in negative equity.  We have also said, however, that it will not be increased in the lifetime of the Government and that the valuation will apply to 2016.  This gives certainty to the majority who will be paying less than \u20ac300 a year.<\/p><p>Senator Jillian van Turnhout referred to the buildings owned by youth organisations.  My understanding from the Minister for Finance is that the exemption that applies to domestic charges will apply in this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900064#NNN01200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1355947500,"counter":870,"content":"<\/a> <p>Will the Minister take up my offer to the State?

There are also concerns about the availability of step-down facilities from hospital and comprehensive home care packages for the elderly.<\/p><p>While the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is calling for certain standards in nursing homes, it is not providing the necessary support and the sharing of information to assist them meeting those standards.  Many nursing homes feel it would be helpful if there were more consultation with all groups involved in the care of the elderly.  A comprehensive long-term programme for care of the elderly is necessary.  A recent report pointed out that 49% of people occupying hospital bed spaces are over 65.  We must ensure the appropriate services outside of hospital are available to these people when they are well enough to leave hospital.  We can only achieve this if we have more consultation on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900066#PPP00500","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1355948400,"counter":886,"content":"<p>It is always a pleasure to be in the Seanad.  I sometimes feel like I am a Member of this House I am so often here.  I thank Senator Burke for raising this issue as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House on policy and services for older people.  Close co-operation has long been a hallmark of the way both statutory and non-statutory organisations do business in the area of services for older people.  This is reflected in significant advances in policy, funding and services achieved for the sector over recent years.  This, if anything, has been given greater impetus by the clear commitments contained in the programme for Government and the necessity, more than ever, to collectively advance planning for the changing and evolving role of older people in society.<\/p><p>This aim is reinforced, if we bear in mind our nation's changing demographics and the expected pressures on future resources generally.  Notwithstanding the very difficult financial environment we face at the moment, the Health Service Executive, HSE, still spends \u20ac1.4 billion annually on older people.  This is separate to Exchequer provision by other agencies and includes, for example, long-term residential care and community-based services such as home care, Meals-on-Wheels and day or respite supports.  Current initiatives also encompass the review recently commenced by the Government of the nursing homes support scheme and improving services for older people generally in the context of the health reforms now under way.<\/p><p>The concept of supporting older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible remains to the fore of the Government's agenda.  We have also prioritised, and acted upon, the need to better co-ordinate and deliver the wider ambit of services for older people beyond just health and social services.  This is being progressed, for example, through the recently published national carers strategy and the forthcoming national positive aging strategy, due to be published shortly.  The positive aging strategy will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people.  It will chart a common framework for the development of operational plans by relevant Departments and agencies and will reflect the expressed wishes of the many strands that comprise non-statutory organ for older people.<\/p> <p>The Department regularly meets relevant stakeholders, whether statutory or non-statutory, to develop policies and services for older people.  In addition to regular contact with a wide range of individual organisations, we have also initiated public consultation and submission processes, as appropriate, which receive full and proper consideration.<\/p><p>The Government has embarked on a major reform programme for the health system.  The future sustainability and model of delivery of social care services will be subject to detailed policy analysis and consultation along the lines of the initiatives set out in Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-15.  The framework commits to developing a social and continuing care system that promotes independence and maximises value for the resources invested.  In light of the strategic direction indicated by the programme for Government and the numerous consultation avenues already in force in relation to older people, I am happy that sufficient mechanisms are available to all stakeholders for consultation.<\/p><p>I recently launched a clinical programme for older people and geriatric medicine.  This is an important research and clinical programme which will from the outset operate to a set of standards for dealing with older people.  The programme reflects what advocates recommend in the context of planning for demographic change.  When someone presents to an acute hospital preparation of a discharge plan will commence immediately.  It will no longer be acceptable to release people back into the community without the supports they require.  We can allow people to exit acute services at a much earlier stage if we provide proper support.  I believe this is the type of planning that the Senator has in mind.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012121900066#PPP00600","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1355948700,"counter":888,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.
