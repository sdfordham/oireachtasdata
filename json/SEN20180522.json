I raise the issue of the future of the national network of post offices, the standing of which has been wobbly in the past decade or so.  Many post offices have shut their doors and the future remains uncertain for those which continue to operate.  Postmasters and postmistresses have provided a great community service and a warm space for communities to gather.  This service is obviously under serious threat.  Will the Minister of State outline the future of post offices and set out what the policy will be?  How does the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment envisage the network improving and expanding in order that post offices will become vibrant spaces within all of our communities?  What is the position on the long-term commitment to provide social welfare payments which represent 40% to 50% of the business transacted in post offices?  The purchase of ancillary services over the counter alongside the social welfare payments contract brings the figure to 60%.  Will the Minister of State publicly provide a detailed plan and timeline for the roll-out of the promised Government and financial services in post offices?<\/p> <p>Looking at the issue in an international context, I cannot help but think of the idea of a people's bank.  In this country we have been subjected to immense suffering and a lost generation have emigrated because of the dismal performance of the banks, which are interested only in maximising profits and accounting to shareholders.  Their sole focus is on commercial banking, not the public interest which is served in other ways in different countries.  I note the position in North Dakota and Germany where there are public banking systems in place which have had great success.  Notwithstanding the fact that it has a population of only 750,000, $1 billion has been returned to the state in North Dakota.  That money is given back to its citizens.  We must not be disenfranchised, therefore, in being kept from ownership of public banking.  Does the Minister have a policy on post offices in the context of mortgage lending, foreign exchange, motor vehicle registration, driver licensing, identification verification cards, foreign exchange cards, bill pay services, parcel lockers and so on?<\/p> <p>I want to introduce a local dimension.  Rialto post office in Dublin South-Central shut its doors for various reasons but public demand ensured it was reopened.  It is now thriving.  I grew up on St. James's Street where a post office has been in place since 1890.  It is adjacent to the Guinness brewery and the largest health infrastructure project in the history of the State, namely, the national children's hospital.  There is student accommodation available there and the street is on the country's primary tourist trail which leads along the same road from Trinity College Dublin to Kilmainham Gaol.  Many foreign workers are employed in the area in which many foreign students, nurses and doctors live, including within the accommodation on the St. James's Hospital campus.  The post office has been given notice, albeit we have managed to have the date extended to 18 July.  I plead with the Minister of State to intervene to find suitable alternative premises for it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Given the evident demand and the historic importance of this post office in that area which has served Guinness workers throughout their lifetime, old age pensioners, the young and now an influx of people from abroad who will need those services, I would like a response on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#B00500","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of European Committee of the Regions","time":1526995800,"counter":13,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#C00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Before I call on the Minister of State, I am sure that Members of the House will wish to join with me in welcoming a delegation from the European Committee of the Regions led by the President of the Committee, Mr. Karl-Heinz Lambertz.<\/p> <p>On my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I wish to extend a warm welcome to you and good wishes for a successful visit to Ireland.

The Minister is acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and is concerned to ensure the needs of those communities continue to be met.<\/p> <p>Reflecting its commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mails service, the Government has made &euro;30 million available in State funding to An Post, &euro;15 million of which will be used to support the renewal of the post office network and &euro;15 million of which will be used for the continued fulfilment of a five day per week mails delivery service.  This, in turn, will secure the future of mail and post office services for local communities throughout the country in both urban and rural areas.  In addition, the company proposes to invest &euro;50 million in growing and modernising the network over the next few years.<\/p> <p>As part of its strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post called An Post Retail.  An Post recently announced its plans for a modernised post office network.  The vision centres around the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network.  Such services will include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses.  The announcement by An Post is supported by an agreement reached with the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, executive following three months of intensive negotiations, which has subsequently been endorsed by 80% of IPU members.<\/p> <p>The announcement represents a positive first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas.<\/p> <p>Given the challenges it is facing, the company will have to pursue an ambitious agenda across its various business areas and there is likely to be significant change and new business models implemented in the coming years.  This should be viewed positively as it will result in a solid, sustainable business future.  Enhanced banking services are becoming available through the post office network with the smart bank account.  It is expected that further such opportunities will be available across the network, especially as high-speed broadband becomes widely available through the roll-out of the national broadband plan.<\/p> <p>As part of its consideration of the financial position of An Post, Government agreed that further opportunities for Government business through the post office network, particularly the payment of motor tax, should be explored.  While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there is always likely to be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services.  The post office network is the obvious choice as the \"offline gateway\" for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens.<\/p> <p>Department officials have engaged with An Post and other relevant stakeholders,  such as the Office of Government Procurement, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and other Departments to assess how additional Government business might be channelled through the post office network.  Discussions have been positive in this regard.  The Minister, Deputy Naughten, along with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and myself, are actively engaged in this to ascertain how we can bring more Government services into the local post office network.  We are determined to ensure that is happening while also remaining cognisant of the need to adhere to public procurement procedures.<\/p> <p>The first practical step that the Government is taking is the digital assist pilot programme.  Under that programme, post offices will provide access to a wide range of Government services.  Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been secured, through the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, for the roll-out of a pilot digital assist scheme.  Ten post offices will be equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions.  The ten pilot schemes will be located in rural post offices and will be in place later this year.<\/p> <p>The affiliation with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection remains a significant feature for the future of the post office network.  In April 2018, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department's contract with An Post to provide pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments in cash at post offices.  Last year's contract amounted to &euro;51 million for 33.6 million payments, and the value of the 2018 contract is expected to match that.  This reaffirms Government policy which sees the post office network as a key piece of the country's financial and social infrastructure, particularly in rural areas.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Accordingly, A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to actively encouraging payment at post offices.

The Minister of State says people are not proficient or comfortable in accessing digital services online at home and he is providing some training within ten pilot post offices in rural areas.  The point also needs to be made that a significant amount of those people who are not comfortable with online tools actually prefer human interaction.  It is an important part of the fabric of communities, building resilient and stronger communities, and battling isolation.

I acknowledge the importance of the sector as part of a suite of opportunities and possibilities to deliver much-needed housing for rent and purchase.  The sector has made a good contribution and it is willing to continue to shoulder some of the responsibility and make a positive input to providing much-needed affordable homes for the public.  I am interested in the Minister's reply regarding the appointment of a regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#D00400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I am aware from his membership of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government that he has a keen interest in the matter.  We often battle politely in that forum and I very much appreciate his engagement, expertise and interest in this area.<\/p> <p>Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness recognises the key contribution that approved housing bodies, AHBs, make to the delivery of social housing.  AHBs are expected to contribute approximately one third of the 50,000 new social housing units that are to be provided over the period of the plan.  The capacity of AHBs to deliver on the targets set out in the plan will require them to expand greatly and to seek significantly increased levels of external investment in the sector.  AHBs that have statutorily regulated standards of governance and management capacity will be better able to access loan finance, which will greatly assist them to develop and expand in line with the objectives set out in the Rebuilding Ireland plan.<\/p> <p>Under existing legislation, housing bodies are granted approved status by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 for the purpose of receiving funding from local authorities to provide social housing.  This arrangement has been in place since 1992 and the Government acknowledges that a more modern regulatory system needs to be put in place to oversee a sector which has developed significantly since then.<\/p> <p>My Department is working with the Attorney General's office in drafting the housing (regulation of registered housing providers) Bill which will provide statutory regulation for the AHB sector.  It is intended to establish a regulator to oversee the effective governance, financial management and performance of voluntary and co-operative housing bodies in providing housing in accordance with the Housing Acts.  The Bill aims to introduce stronger safeguards for public and private investment in the social housing provision sector, to establish a framework that will enable the voluntary and co-operative housing sector to contribute more effectively to the provision of social housing, and to ensure the assets built through investments in the sector are managed sustainably.  The statutory regulatory framework will provide further assurances to tenants, the Government and investors and to the sector itself that social housing providers operate in a well-regulated and stable environment.<\/p> <p>The regulator will be responsible for approving and registering housing bodies and the setting of regulatory standards.  The Bill will provide extensive powers for the regulator in respect of the undertaking of inquiries, investigations and assessments.  The regulator will also have enforcement and other powers.  My Department is working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to finalise the text of the Bill for publication as soon as possible.  I had hoped that the Bill would be published before now, but the complex nature of some issues related to transitioning from voluntary to statutory regulation has required additional time.  Notwithstanding this, I hope to publish the Bill before the end of the current D&aacute;il term.<\/p> <p>The Government is acutely aware of the importance of this sector and, in advance of establishing the statutory regulatory framework, put in place measures to prepare the sector for the new regulatory regime.  In 2014, an interim regulation committee for the AHB sector was established under the auspices of the Housing Agency, which, supported by a regulation office based within the agency, oversees implementation of a voluntary regulation code, VRC, for AHBs.<\/p> <p>A number of recent developments, including the decision by EUROSTAT and the CSO to reclassify AHBs as being part of the general government balance and the Central Bank's amending regulations to facilitate credit unions to provide funding to AHBs under certain conditions, are feeding into our considerations on the legislation and will ensure that the regulatory framework reflects the current and forward-looking policy context for the approved housing body sector.  My Department is working intently on finalising the legislative proposals for submission to Government.  In the meantime, I am confident that the interim arrangements for regulating the sector will ensure that it continues to operate to a high standard and enable it to fulfil its role under the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#E00200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response.

Seven of the 12 cases have been positively identified as suspected victims of trafficking in human beings, with five referrals still under investigation by the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.<\/p> <p>The number of potential victims identified equates to one in ten of the permits issued over the past 18 months.  The Department of Justice and Equality, in its statement, plays pass the parcel on this issue citing the Workplace Relations Commission and the marine survey office as the relevant authorities.  It is worth repeating that.  When faced with the most serious potential charges of human trafficking, the Department of Justice and Equality has said it has nothing to do with it and has passed the buck to the Minister of State's Department.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State tell us what he intends to do regarding the recommendations in this report?  The Department has had six months to consider the report and is now aware of the most serious charges of human trafficking in the industry.  The Minister of State will know that the figure quoted by our Naval Service clearly shows there is a problem in the sector.  There were 109 workers found working illegally on 86 boats.  The key recommendation from our report is that one Government Department takes overall responsibility for the sector.  We also call for a moratorium on the issuing of new permits until such time as all non-EEA nationals are regularised.  We recommended a reconstituted task force be set up, including the International Transport Workers' Federation, in order to deal with the myriad problems in the scheme.  We recommended a review of the marine survey office and a simplified and transparent permit process.  Will the Minister of State tell me what he has done in the six months since receiving this report?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#F00600","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Gavan for raising the issue.

The main recommendation of that task force was the establishment of a sector-specific atypical worker permission scheme, which is an extension of the existing atypical worker permission scheme administered by the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>The scheme was established and is operated through the co-operative efforts of the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As a number of Departments are involved in the scheme it is monitored by an oversight committee with members from relevant Departments and State agencies.  The Department of Justice and Equality retains responsibility for immigration matters under the scheme while the memorandum of understanding put in place, which is led by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation with relevant State enforcement bodies, provides for a rigorous and effective inspection system.  This system provides, for the first time, a structured and transparent framework for the employment of non-EEA workers within defined segments of the Irish fishing fleet.  The scheme sets down minimum terms and conditions of employment applicable to these workers, which are in line with the general statutory terms and conditions applicable to workers more generally in the State.  Any abuses or otherwise of the specified employment conditions of a non-EEA national in the Irish fishing industry are a matter for the relevant enforcement agencies - the Workplace Relations Commission, the marine survey office of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and other appropriate authorities of the State.  Inspectors of the Workplace Relations Commission, based on newly acquired powers, have been trained and equipped with support from a number of agencies to board vessels and carry out their own inspections.  This has already happened.<\/p><p>The role of my Department in the scheme is solely in respect of maintaining the central depository of contracts and supporting documentation submitted under the scheme, in order to monitor to ensure that the cap of 500 is not exceeded in any 12 month period.  To date, 262 contracts have been lodged with the central depository.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service has granted atypical worker permissions to 229 applicants under the scheme since its commencement in February 2016.  The atypical worker permission scheme for non-EEA crew is still a relatively young scheme and further time is needed to allow the scheme to become established and to deliver on its objectives.  There are undoubtedly enforcement challenges under the scheme.  These challenges fall to be addressed by the appropriate enforcement agencies, and there is ongoing work in this area.  Finally, cases of human trafficking are outside the scope of the scheme and must be dealt with firmly under the human trafficking legislation in order to eliminate such behaviour and to ensure that non-EEA workers in the fishing industry are only engaged in full compliance with the terms of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#F00700","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Will all due respect, the Minister of State has not answered my key question.

One recommendation is that a single Government Department takes responsibility for the fishing industry.  I do not think that is possible.  Another is that vessels under 15 m should be included in the scheme.  The reason they were not included in the first place is that vessels under 15 m tend to be smaller and generally provide local employment.  It was not intended that this scheme be open to all fishing boats around the country.  It was felt that some should be reserved for local employment.  As someone who chaired a committee in the last Oireachtas which considered the role of coastal and island communities in the small fishing sector, the whole idea was that we would provide local employment for local people.  The reconstituted task force should be considered but I am not sure that it should run in the way the Senator envisages.  The report recommends that permissions be linked to the employee and not the specific vessel or owner.  In that case the contract would be gone and it would be a wholly different scheme.  It would not be the scheme that is in place.<\/p><p>Finally, it is recommended that applications should be made directly to a central registry that is open to the public.  This scheme as designed is based on a contract between an individual who is a non-EEA citizen and an owner.  That contract has to be signed by a solicitor, witnessed and given legal status before it can go to the Department of Justice and Equality and before that permission can be issued.  The Senator is talking about designing a completely new scheme.  He wants to do this before the current scheme is fine-tuned and made work.  On eliminating trafficking, I have no doubt that the trafficking dealt with in recent media coverage relates to people who are not part of this scheme.  That is part of the problem.  They came in a different way.  They were not participants in the scheme in the first place and they should be dealt with by the law.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the appropriate authority to deal with that particular scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#G00500","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Swimming Pool Programme","time":1526995800,"counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#H00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>As the Minister probably knows, Fingal is the fastest growing county in Ireland and north Fingal is the fastest growing area within it.  North Fingal includes Balbriggan, Balrothery, Skerries, Naul, Rush, Lusk, Garristown, Oldtown, Donabate and Portrane.  The area has a rapidly expanding population and substantial future growth is planned.  To give an idea of the size of the towns involved, Balbriggan has a population of approximately 26,000 and Rush currently has a population of approximately 10,000.  As I have said, there are also future plans for the area and, as I have also outlined, the demographic is young.<\/p> <p>There is no swimming pool in the north Fingal area.  The children of north Fingal cannot readily avail of swimming lessons, which are now seen as almost a standard part of the school curriculum.  They cannot avail of something as basic as swimming lessons without having to travel long distances and incur the additional costs of that travel.  Children with autism and ADHD particularly benefit from water-based therapies but unfortunately the distances such children would have to travel from north Fingal in order to avail of such therapies in a swimming pool would negate any benefit they might derive from them.  Older people can also derive great health and social benefits from access to a swimming pool within their community.<\/p> <p>Plans for a swimming pool for north Fingal stretch back to the year 2000 when a swimming pool for Skerries was planned through Fingal County Council, which applied for the local authority swimming pool programme administered through the Minister's Department.  When these plans fell through Fingal County Council put forward a plan for construction of a swimming pool in conjunction with Balbriggan Rugby Football Club in Balrothery.  These plans ultimately fell through and in January 2016 Fingal County Council voluntarily withdrew from the local authority swimming pool programme.  I raised the need for a swimming pool in the area by way of Commencement matter on 9 May 2017.  I was told by the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, who attended the Chamber on that date that it was now open to Fingal County Council to apply for a sports grant which is capped at &euro;500,000 due to its withdrawal from the local authority swimming pool programme.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is significantly less than the &euro;3.8 million per project which was available under the previous local authority swimming pool programme.  I was told on that occasion that the future funding of swimming pools was being examined by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as part of a review of national sports policy which was to have a particular focus on how sporting facilities are to be funded into the future.  I was advised that the Department was in the process of making a submission under the mid-term capital review to seek additional funding for large-scale sports infrastructure like swimming pools.  I was told that if this funding was received, it would allow the Department to give further consideration to new projects like swimming pools, thereby allowing county councils to submit plans for such projects.<\/p><p>I would like to know what the outcome of the review of national sports policy was, particularly insofar as it related to the construction of swimming pools.  I would like to know whether the Department has received additional funding under the mid-term capital review plan.  If so, has a new programme been established?  I emphasise the urgent need for a swimming pool in the northern part of Fingal, especially in light of the demographics of the area and the lack of facilities to match the housing that has been built in the area in recent years and the housing that is planned for the future.  We should not pile houses into an area without providing adequate facilities for the community.  The people of Balbriggan recently came together to form a committee to press for the development of a swimming pool.  This is an expression of the level of public support and demand for a swimming pool in north Fingal.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could address the specific points I have raised with regard to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#H00200","speaker":"1376","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Clifford-Lee for raising this topic, with which I have a great deal of sympathy.

That is not quite possible, but we are doing our very best to achieve it.<\/p> <p>The local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, provides grant aid towards the capital costs of new public swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools.  The programme provides for maximum grant aid of &euro;3.8 million per project.  The four principal stages which must be undertaken by a local authority in developing a swimming pool project are: preliminary report stage, including feasibility study; contract document stage; tender stage; and construction stage.<\/p> <p>Regarding the provision of a swimming pool in north Fingal, a proposal for a new pool in Skerries, County Dublin, was originally included in the 2000 round of the local authority swimming pool programme.  The Department approved the preliminary report in January 2001.  As no contract documents or tender reports were ever received for Skerries, no grant was approved for that project.  The Skerries project was planned as a public private partnership.  In March 2009, the Department received a letter from Fingal County Council stating that this proposal was terminated due to difficulties with the residential element of the proposed scheme and that the new priority for Fingal County Council was to locate a pool in Balbriggan.  In April 2009, Fingal County Council forwarded a preliminary report for the proposed Balbriggan pool.  As the Senator has outlined, the proposal was for Balbriggan Rugby Football Club, in conjunction with a private operator, to build a swimming pool on the club's grounds at Balrothery.  It was proposed that the pool would be managed by the swimming pool operator, which would put finance in place for the development.<\/p> <p>The OPW approved the preliminary report for the Balbriggan proposal in May 2009, subject to a minor modification and subject to the council and the Department being satisfied that the tender process would be transparent and fair.  The council was asked to consider issues of procurement and state aid to a private operator and to ensure all relevant EU directives would be adhered to.  I understand that due to difficulties in adhering to these requirements, no further progress was made with the project at the Balbriggan site.<\/p> <p>Accordingly, my Department wrote to Fingal County Council in January 2016 to raise concerns about the delay and to ask the council to consider withdrawing this project from the local authority swimming pool programme.  The letter stated that if Fingal County Council agreed to the withdrawal of Balbriggan swimming pool from the local authority swimming pool programme, it may be possible for Fingal County Council and Balbriggan Rugby Football Club to receive a sports capital programme allocation instead.  Fingal County Council agreed to the voluntary withdrawal of the Balbriggan project from the local authority swimming pool programme and the Department formally notified the council of its removal in April 2016.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Shane Ross:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Fingal County Council subsequently applied for a special sports capital programme allocation for Balbriggan RFC.

An announcement on when applications will be accepted will be made once the terms and conditions have been finalised.  It will be open to all local authorities, including Fingal County Council, to submit an application for any suitable project under the terms that will apply.  In addition, the upcoming national sports policy which I expect to be considered by the Government in the coming weeks, with a view to its publication shortly thereafter, will include a specific focus on how the Government should fund sports facilities, including swimming pools, in the years ahead.  <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the current position.

These women have been described by HSE psychiatrists from Dublin South-Central as a new profile of women and it was stated that the statistics are unique to the area. <\/p><p>They include mothers with young children, women who were early school leavers, women who are homeless, women with adverse childhood experiences and women with drug and substance abuse histories.

I would like to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to reconsider disallowing groups in Dublin 8 and 12 from participating in the process for applying for patronage of the school at the site.  I cannot understand why they would be disallowed from applying for patronage as the school is in close proximity to residents of Dublin 8 and 12.  There is a lack of multidenominational, non-fee paying schools in Dublin 8 and 12 and given their proximity to the site it is outrageous that parents have been excluded from the process.  Would it be possible for the Minister to come to the House to explain how the catchment area for the new school was decided and why Dublin 8 and 12 were excluded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#N00300","speaker":"1407","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I refer to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, an area on which I will focus.

One is the skills gap.  A significant skills gap is appearing in Ireland, in particular in respect of SMEs.  Larger companies, many of which are multinational, are attracting many prospective employees, but SMEs do not have the resources to compete with them in incentivising people to work for them.

Staff retention and acquiring staff are huge issues and I will come back with suggested solutions to these.  This Friday, 25 May, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, comes into effect but the majority of small and medium-sized businesses know next to nothing about it or about how it affects them, which will be in a huge way.  There are consequences, unintended when the legislation was passed, for small and medium-sized businesses with significant fines in what is significant legislation.  There is a significant disconnect between the State and SMEs on what it is about, how the legislation can be put into practice and its cost, which is very significant.  There should be workshops and some space should be afforded to SMEs to allow them to get up to speed with the legislation.<\/p><p>I have a couple of solutions.  We should have an effective employee share option programme, and I welcome the statement made yesterday by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport at a round-table conference I attended regarding employees potentially having some form of a shareholding in State bodies.  A programme is available for SMEs called the SAYE programme, a Revenue-approved save-as-you-earn scheme.  It is a fraction of what is available in the UK and SME employers and employees are not taking it up.  It has to be a lot more user-friendly to be beneficial to both employers and employees.  By having such a scheme, employers and employees will stick together more and employees will not jump ship to larger employers as often as they do at the moment.  We now have a different problem from the one we had three years ago when there was unemployment of 14.5%.  It is now down to just over 5.5% so we need a very different strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#O00200","speaker":"1431","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I extend my sympathy and that of the Sinn F&eacute;in team to the families of Ana Kriegel and Jastine Valdez who lost their lives over the past week.  They are tragic and shocking situations and they should refocus us on the work we need to do to keep everyone, but particularly women, safe in Ireland.  Everybody is horrified at what happened in recent days.<\/p> <p>I also want to talk about agriculture and farming and about vulture funds.  Some 2,500 or even 3,000 farmers may be in danger of losing their lands to vulture funds.  This amounts to at least 150,000 acres under threat.  Vulture funds specialise in forcing though quick-fire sales when an alternative is available, and I have spoken to many farm families on this matter who tell me that vulture funds are refusing to engage.  The banks say the protection afforded to the loans they sold off to vulture funds continues after the sale but that is not the case.  The funds are refusing to restructure loans, meaning farmers are forced down the legal route when they do not have the money for the huge legal expenses which are involved in that.  The vulture funds have the money, however, because they are hugely wealthy companies in the first place but also because they get away without paying any tax.  The farming community do not get away without paying tax.  The smallest of farm incomes are taxed and farmers have to submit their returns every year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is a real contrast between how vulture funds and farm families are treated.  Recent comments were made in committees and by commentators that farmers are not engaging on non-performing loans.  It has been said again that non-performing loans have to be dealt with but that is not correct because in many cases the level of defaulter arrears is quite small.  Our experience is that farm loans are very attractive to vulture funds as their level of security is very strong.  The cynicism shown by the companies will have a devastating effect on families that have worked the land for generations and make a hugely positive contribution to their communities.  Does the Government have any plans to ensure the agricultural sector is not hit hardest and that forced sales to make a quick buck are not allowed to threaten the social fabric of rural Ireland.  One must ask who will end up owning those farms at the end of the day.  Farms are located in the middle of communities.  In some cases relatives often own parcels of adjoining land and the question is who will end up owning it.  That has significant consequences for us in the short, medium and long terms, and it needs to be stopped.  Legislation must be put in place to control vulture funds and how they are treating farm families at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#P00200","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>First, I join with Senator Conway-Walsh in expressing my horror at the brutal murder of two beautiful, young, intelligent women in this country.

I note the fact that the Archbishop of Adelaide has been convicted of covering up child abuse.  He is the highest ranking member of the church to be so convicted.  The entire hierarchy of Chile has offered the Pope its resignation on this matter.  This is a good Pope.  He is a Christ-like man.  I think he is absolutely wonderful.  That is why I initiated the invitation to him from this House.  He learns on the hoof.  He first of all dismissed these accusations but when he went to Chile he learned about them and he has since apologised.  He invited three of the abuse victims to meet him in Rome.  That is a wonderful thing.  One of the victims, Juan Carlos Cruz, told the Spanish newspaper <i>El Pais<\/i>that the Pope told him during a meeting in the Vatican that the fact that he is gay does not matter.  Mr. Cruz said Pope Francis had also told him that God made him this way and loves him this way and it does not matter to him.  He said the Pope loves him this way and that he must be happy the way he is.  How wonderful.  What a magical transformation from the vicious, condemnation we got under the papacy of Pope Francis's two predecessors.  I welcome this very much, in particular since last week when I stood in the Phoenix Park at the papal cross holding a message asking the Pope to moderate the language of the catechism on this issue.

I agree with Senator Ardagh that we need to have the Minister for Education and Skills attend the House in the next few days.  We have long prided ourselves on our terrific education system.  That is great.  There are great schools, principals, teachers and students.  We are placing huge pressure on parents, however, to keep the lights on in some schools.  It is just not good enough when they are paying tax to provide these utilities.<\/p> <p>I have been in contact with the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association and individual primary school principals following the slashing of &euro;100 million in capitation grants from education budgets over a number of years.  Capitation grants are paid to voluntary primary and secondary schools based on the number of recognised pupils enrolled.  While the grant is supposed to cover the overall cost of running schools, it fails to meet these.  Although it costs as much to run a large primary school as to run a secondary school, the rate of pay for the latter is almost three times the rate for the former.  Primary schools are losing out.  Unless parents reach deep into their pockets, some schools will be at a disadvantage.  While some schools are lucky to have amazing fundraising committees, the parents at others are under severe stress because they cannot pay their voluntary contribution.  They simply cannot afford it.  While we spin the idea of free education, any parent will say that it is far from free.<\/p> <p>I join principals in calling for the restoration of the grant to the pre-cut level of &euro;200 per annum per child.  We must invest more in the schools we have now.  We must complete the school building projects we have started and fulfil the promises we have made before announcing new schools and, as usual, blaming the guys from before.  Our children deserve our full commitment to giving them all the best chance, not just those with wealthy parents or machine-like fundraising committees.  Grants for primary schools can certainly be increased if we see them as a necessity.  We all look at them that way, or at least those of us who have put our children through the Irish school system.  If the grants were restored, we could then contribute for nice things instead of paying for heat, light and paper as is happening now.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister to come to the House to address this very serious issue.

Following the referendum, I will call on the Minister of State with responsibility for electoral reform to the House to discuss options for enhancing youth voting and to ask why such obvious measures have yet to be put in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#U00300","speaker":"1372","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I raise the issue of farm safety.  In 2017, 50 people lost their lives in farm-related accidents.  Farms, by their nature, are generally family enterprises.  They are great places to grow up but unfortunately dangerous places to live in.  The age profile of those killed is also of great concern.  The old and the young are exceptionally vulnerable to death and serious injury on farms.  Animals, machinery and slurry pits are among the greatest dangers posed to adults and children on family farms.  The nature of the accidents on our farms can have long-lasting, heartbreaking and devastating impacts on families.  At this time of year, farmers are exceptionally busy working long hours, often on their own.  In cases such as this, fatigue can creep in.  The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, has now refocused on improving farm safety by way of a television and radio campaign that focuses on all aspects of farm safety.  I too appeal to members of the farming community to be extra careful on their farms.  It is an exceptionally busy time of year for farmers.  School children will be getting their school holidays shortly and will be helping on the farms.  I appeal to all members of the farming community to be extra careful and to be conscious of all the dangers that surround them as they go about their daily tasks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#V00200","speaker":"1396"},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the 14 Members of the House who made contributions to the Order of Business.  On behalf of the Government and the House and on my own behalf, I join with Senators Conway-Walsh, Norris, Butler, Murnane O'Connor, Craughwell, Devine, Colm Burke and Horkan in offering our sympathies to the families of Jastine Valdez and Anastasia Kriegel on their very sad deaths.  The brutal and callous killings sent a chill across society.  They were brutal.  We all know there is no place for killing in our society.  We must always respect each other.  Today there are families distraught.  They have lost a loved one, an only daughter.  It is mind-boggling.  Senator Craughwell also mentioned the family of Mr. Hennessy.  We should remember that family as well.  I commend the garda&iacute; for their tremendous work.  I commend all the first responders who helped and those who gave assistance.  We must always work to ensure our society and our streets are safe for all people.  When one sees young women and girls being killed, it prompts the question: why and what more can we do as a society?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I join in the condemnation of the killings and hope we will all stand in support of, and solidarity with, the families at this awful time.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh raised the suicide rates in Dublin South-Central.  The increase is a worry.  Senators Devine and Grace O'Sullivan also referred to the issue of mental health.  First, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, is focused on increasing resources in the mental health area to ensure that we continue to develop mental health services and to improve access to treatment and assessment.  He secured an increase in the budget for 2018 and current funding is &euro;910 million.  As Senator Devine mentioned, there is capital investment in new facilities and new staff.  Mental health is an issue we must continue to prioritise.  I agree with Senator Devine about the people in our prisons.  They are in there for a variety of reasons but if one believes in restorative justice and rehabilitation we must always ensure that our prison system, which has one function we are all aware of, rehabilitates people as well.  I agree with the Senator that people in our prisons who have mental health issues deserve to be looked after and treated.  Equally, I agree with Senator Grace O'Sullivan that mental health is health, pure and simple.  Regardless of what viewpoint one has in the referendum campaign, mental health is about the health and well-being of all citizens.  It is an important issue that must be prioritised.<\/p><p>In referring to the increase Senator Ardagh also referred to the new profile of women.  It is a worry.  The mental health of women is an important matter and it needs to be addressed in view of the figures she gave us today.  As I said, improvements have been made in a variety of areas but it is distressing to hear Senator Ardagh's remarks.  I do not have that information to hand.  However, we will have a continuing debate on mental health.  She also referred to the former greyhound racing stadium in Harold's Cross in Dublin.  It is a good news story that there will be a new primary and secondary school with 1,000 places.  I believe it is open to all prospective patrons and patron bodies to apply for patronage of a new school under the patronage process.  The Department of Education and Skills is developing a new online patronage scheme.  I am not familiar with the matter Senator Ardagh raised but I will be happy to invite the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to the House again.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh spoke about small and medium enterprises and awareness of GDPR.  The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, produced a survey which showed that 90% of small and medium enterprises are aware of GDPR but the Senator is correct that we must continue to promulgate awareness of the effect and potential consequences of the new regime that comes into force at the end of the month.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, have been very proactive on the skills gap.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh that small and medium enterprises are the heartbeat of our country.  The Government is committed to developing that sector.  I will be happy to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to the House to discuss the points the Senator made in the context of small and medium enterprises.<\/p><p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the agriculture sector and the issue of vulture funds with regard to farmers, particularly small farmers.  The Government is acutely aware of this.  I hope the loans can be resolved within the existing bank structure.  The banks and the farmers or landowners have an obligation to engage.  As the Senator knows, when one engages one puts a stop on the clock and an element of fear and uncertainty is taken away.  It is important to recognise that the farming community and small and medium enterprises are at the heart of what we are as a people and nation.  That is the reason there is regulation by the Central Bank to regulate the matter raised by Senator Conway-Walsh.  However, it is important to have engagement and conversation so I will be happy to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is an issue we recognise as important.<\/p><p>Senator Norris raised the issue of the court case involving the cover-up of child abuse and the Archbishop of Adelaide.  I am happy to let the courts decide on that matter.  We have a very robust child protection code in our country which needs to be upheld at all times.<\/p><p>Senator Butler raised the issue of vacant properties.  The Government is aware of the needs in some rural towns.  A variety of schemes have been introduced by Government to try to incentivise people to relocate and open businesses, but there is an obligation and duty on local authorities, Government and the business sector to work together to ensure that we continue to have vibrant rural towns.<\/p><p>Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of education.  I regret that she is not here.  I was not going to blame Fianna F&aacute;il for cutting funding at the beginning.  I was going to say that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is committed to increasing the capitation grant in the forthcoming budget.  He was the Minister who secured an extra &euro;1 billion for education in the previous two budgets.  He has strengthened the core of our education system.  The Minister has created more school places, employed additional teachers and taken on more special needs assistants.  This means that the pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced and that our education system has more teachers, more places and more new buildings, which is a pretty good record, to be fair to him.  A sum of &euro;10 billion was allocated for education in the previous budget, and the Minister has also committed to reducing costs for parents with the forthcoming publication of the education (parent and student charter) Bill.  Senator Murnane O'Connor should reflect upon that.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the garda who fired the shots on Saturday night.  The Cathaoirleach rightly said that there is an inquiry by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  I will not stray into that area.  The Senator also mentioned the Minister of Finance's speech in Galway.  I am happy to have the Minister come to the House to debate that matter.<\/p><p>Senator Feighan recognised the importance of the Good Friday Agreement.  Is our country not a better place as a result of the signatures of Ireland, the UK and the parties in the North to the Good Friday Agreement?  It is important that we continue to promote the benefits of the agreement.  In that context it is equally important that we all resolve to have Stormont back in action and a government in the North of our country.  I commend Senator Feighan on  his work not just in the UK and on British-Irish and North-South bases but across the United States where he has been promoting Ireland and good relations.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Feighan on his words of wisdom on the royal wedding last weekend.  While many people pretended that they did not watch it, the number of people who said to me, when I was out canvassing, that they could not talk because they were watching the royal wedding was extraordinary.  It is good that we can have the conversation here.  It is important that we continue to promote good relations.  We are lucky that Senator Marshall has joined us to show that we can build bridges and have diverse views in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is a positive.<\/p><p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of the green ribbon and mental health.  I have addressed that.  Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of his Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill 2016.  I assure the House that it is not the Leader stalling the Bill.  I commend the Senator on his work.  He makes the very wise and legitimate point that death certificates cannot be issued and that is a significant issue for many families awaiting news or who, for a variety of reasons, understand that the only outcome is going to be death.  I commend Senator Burke on his work.  We on the Government side will bring that Bill back to the House as soon as possible.  It will not be held up from my end.<\/p><p>Senator Horkan raised the issues of planning, the planning process and the need to have a debate about planning.  He is right.  The decision by Apple in the context of the planning delay illustrates difficulties we have and which we must overcome.  The Senator is right and Government is looking at the issue of streamlined and fast-tracked planning.  It is important that we look at having a debate on making our planning system more efficient.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=22\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While we do not want to go back to the bad old days, it is important, as the Senator rightly said, for the development of key infrastructure to take place in a variety of ways.  I think his point is well made.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield raised issues relating to the supplementary register, young people and voting.  I think his comments highlight the need to have an electoral commission that can take charge of election issues independent of the Government and of the Oireachtas.  I would be happy to have a debate on this matter when we resume after the referendum.  It is important for us to have an independent electoral commission to deal with the electoral register, encourage people to vote, look at what happens between elections and manage the democratic process.  I would be happy to have a debate on this issue.<\/p><p>Senator Gallagher spoke about farm safety.  As he will recall, Senator Conway chaired the Seanad Public Consultation Committee when it considered this matter.  The Minister has been to the House to discuss farm safety.  The points made by Senator Gallagher are very relevant as we approach the busy season for the farming community.  The Senator highlighted the potential dangers associated with parts of the farm like the slurry pit, the silage pit and the machinery yard.  It is important to create awareness.  Regardless of the section of the Government that deals with this issue, it is important during the busy farming season for people to be aware of the potential disasters that exist on the farm.  Farm safety is something we must highlight.  I will be happy for the Minister to come back to the House again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#V00300","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526995800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Order of Business agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1526995800,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.25 p.m. and resumed at 4.50 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Data Protection Bill 2018: [Seanad Bill amended by the D\u00e1il] Report and Final Stages","time":1526995800,"counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018052200002#DD00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1526995800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 148, this Bill is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and has been placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.
