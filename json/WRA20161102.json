The Santa Marta Group is a global alliance of international Police Chiefs and Bishops working together with Civil Society to eradicate human trafficking and modern day slavery.

Specially trained officers from the Human Trafficking Investigation and Coordination Unit of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau were involved in operations at both Castletownbere and Howth. These officers focused on finding people who demonstrated any indicators of human trafficking, particularly crew members of fishing vessels. Further objectives included:<\/p>  <p>  - Identifying offences under the Atypical Work Permit Scheme for non-EEA crew in the Irish fishing fleet,<\/p>  <p>  - Breaches of employment legislation,<\/p>  <p>  - Immigration offences,<\/p>  <p>  - Breaches of tax\/revenue and customs offences,<\/p>  <p>  - To apprehend suspects in the commission and\/or the attempted commission of offences above and fully investigate, detect and prosecute (where possible) any offences outstanding against these suspects and groups, and<\/p>  <p>  - Identify and support any suspected victims of human trafficking that might be found. <\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that inspections were carried out on 41 fishing vessels, 22 in Castletownbere, 16 in Howth, and three offshore inspections. Inspections at port were led by the Workplace Relations Commission Inspectorate, under Section 27 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015, accompanied and assisted by Garda&iacute; and Revenue and Customs officials. The naval service carried out the offshore inspections.  <\/p>  <p>  No evidence of human trafficking or labour exploitation was found in any location. A number of suspected breaches of the atypical work permit scheme for non-EEA crew, were detected, as well as other suspected breaches of employment law, immigration law and tax offences. Both the Workplace Relations Commission and the Garda National Immigration Bureau are following up in relation to these suspected breaches. I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that their approach and that of partner agencies was non-confrontational and geared towards seeking the cooperation of those encountered; no incidents were reported at any location. <\/p>  <p>  The prevention and detection of human trafficking in all its forms and the protection of its victims has been a policing priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the past number of years and it remains a priority in 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200060#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200060#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[32822\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200060#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will confirm, in view of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, whether the parents and legal guardians of persons residing in St. Mary of the Angels, Beaufort, County Kerry, will continue to have the right to make decisions on the accommodation of these persons; her views on whether any of the proposed provisions of the Bill could impact on those rights; and her views on whether the State or any other agency is assuming the legal rights of residents who are 18 years of age or over.","asker":"1317","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Members of the Government are not officially responsible to the D&aacute;il for interpreting or stating the law, and therefore it would not be appropriate for me to comment or advise in relation to this individual case.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I can say that the primary aim of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is to put in place a new legislative framework to support persons with capacity difficulties, including those with intellectual disabilities, in a manner that is compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  One of the key requirements of the UN Convention is that persons with capacity difficulties should be enabled to exercise decision-making autonomy.  Consequently, the starting point in the Act is one of enabling persons with capacity difficulties to take their own decisions to the greatest extent possible.  Where they are unable to take decisions themselves, the Act provides for a series of decision-making supports.  However, the priority remains one of ensuring that the person's will and preferences are respected as far as possible.<\/p>  <p>  While I recognise the fundamental and critical role of parents, siblings and other relatives in relation to the day-to-day lives of many people who need assistance in exercising their legal capacity, the focus of the Act is on enabling persons to make their own decisions, including choosing whom they wish to support them in the decision-making process.  However, where persons with capacity difficulties are unable to take decisions themselves, it is likely that, in many cases, family members will be centrally involved in the decision-making support options available under the Act.  Under the co-decision-making option in particular, where decisions are made jointly by the person with capacity difficulties and by the co-decision-maker, it is anticipated that the co-decision-maker will often be a family member as it is a requirement of this support option that the co-decision-maker should know the person and understand his or her will and preferences.  It will also be possible for a family member to apply to the court to be appointed as a decision-making representative for a person with capacity difficulties where that person lacks decision-making capacity.  The Act, in setting out guiding principles and the scope and level of intervention, will be of considerable help to persons with decision-making capacity difficulties and their supportive families.  In addition, the Decision Support Service, which is to be set up within the Mental Health Commission, will be able to provide advice and support to persons with capacity difficulties and the families who help them. <\/p>  <p>  Commencement of the Act is being carried out on a phased basis.  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (which is a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the legislation come into force.  Careful planning and groundwork, and not just funding, has to be put in place to ensure that the commencement of the Act is correctly, appropriately and effectively handled.  My Department is working carefully on this at present in consultation with the Department of Health and the Mental Health Commission.

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with the overall policing arrangements and operational strategies are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of resources and the best possible policing service is provided to the general public.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the number of Garda&iacute; who have applied to the Traffic Corps in the years 2014, 2015, and to date in 2016, and the number of applicants who were accepted, I have requested this information from the Garda Commissioner and I will revert to the Deputy when it is to hand. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  In furtherance of this I recently announced that the Government has approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  No doubt the Traffic Corps, like all Divisions and policing activities will benefit from this accelerated recruitment which is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This investment will support the delivery of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 which sets key strategic objectives for Roads Policing and will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s road policing plans over the next 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  Insofar as road traffic enforcement is concerned generally, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2016 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies, and is being implemented by each Regional Traffic Superintendent.  The focus of the Plan is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders.  Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding, driving while intoxicated, and use of a mobile phone.<\/p>  <p>  Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200060#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Legislation","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200060#WRC02850"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":74,"qnumall":"[32586\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200060#WRC02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if, following this Deputy's Leaders' Question on 19 October 2016 on the topic of road safety, she has met the Taoiseach to correct the Taoiseach's statement (details supplied); if she has informed the Taoiseach that this technology is not yet in use in Irish policing; if she has updated him on the outstanding problem with the wording of summonses allowing for prosecutions under section 22 of the 2002 Road Traffic Act; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that in my capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality I have no direct involvement in the bringing of prosecutions, but am aware, of course, of the issues which arose in relation to the proceedings he has referred to.

The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  The immediate objective of the national revaluation programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 150 years is conducted as soon as possible.  Following the first revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 9(10) of the Valuation Act 2001 provides the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions and decisions with regard to the selection of rating authority areas for revaluation is his sole prerogative.  Section 19(1) of the Act empowers the Commissioner, after consultation with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the rating authority concerned, to make a Valuation Order specifying a rating authority area over which a revaluation is to be conducted.  The revaluation programme which began with South Dublin, Fingal and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council areas has also been rolled out to the Dublin City Council area, Waterford City and County Council area and Limerick City and County Council area.  Since November 2015, revaluation is currently underway in the County Council areas of Kildare, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath. Additionally, the second revaluation of South Dublin has commenced and statutory valuation orders were recently signed to signal the commencement of the revaluation of Counties Carlow and Kilkenny.  The revaluation in these two County Council areas is being conducted on a pilot basis using external resources (outsourcing).  The enabling provision to adopt this approach was provided for in the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, the effect of which is to allow the Commissioner to contract out some of the revaluation work, in order to augment the in-house capacity of the Valuation Office. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 has as its primary purpose the acceleration of the national revaluation programme.  It contains a number of measures in this regard. In addition to the outsourcing of part of the revaluation work, the Act also provided for the Commissioner to conduct a revaluation with the assistance of the occupiers of property using elements of self-assessment.  This provision &ndash; known as &ldquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo; - is one of the express provisions intended to assist the acceleration of the national revaluation programme.  This approach, though readily used in personal and corporate taxation codes, has not been used to date in comparable jurisdictions in relation to property valuations for rating purposes.  I am advised that the Commissioner intends running a pilot project involving the revaluation of the approximately 2,300 commercial properties in County Laois rating authority area using &rdquo;Occupier Assisted Valuation&rdquo;.  Towards this end, the Valuation Office has conducted the necessary statutory consultations with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with Laois County Council and is now embarking on the development of appropriate technical and statutory systems of valuation which will underpin the pilot project and allow for its initiation in 2017.  Careful planning is required at this stage as the pilot involves an entirely different interaction with occupiers of property than has been the case heretofore. <\/p>  <p>  The Occupier Assisted participative approach involves the use of new sophisticated valuation tools for the first time and requires the development and implementation of extensive information and communications technology facilities.  In particular, the provision of a wide range of on-line supports will be essential to the success of the project, including use of video and audio technology to assist ratepayers in carrying out their elements of the process.  It is also intended that there will be extensive engagement with the ratepayers through an information campaign which will be undertaken to ensure maximum participation to ensure the success of the pilot.  While at this stage, the Commissioner cannot be precise about the proposed date on which he intends to sign the statutory Valuation Order to formally commence the revaluation in County Laois, I am informed that he expects to do so no later than 31 July 2017.  Following the signing of the order, the Valuation Office intends to undertake a publicity and information campaign during which each individual ratepayer will be written to informing them of the commencement of the project and requesting information in relation to their property.  There will also be a programme of engagement with the various trade bodies and representative associations with the purpose of keeping them abreast of developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200061#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prisoner Data","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200061#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[32840\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200061#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons from County Tipperary that were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment; the number who were processed at the prison where they were sent and released on the same day or the following day, by prison, by category of crime, by length of sentence given, in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1350","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":182,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the statistics being sought are not readily available.

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State by the end of 2017, through a combination of the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focused on resettling refugees from camps in Jordan and Lebanon.  The possibility of an additional refugee pledge in 2017 is under active consideration.  Other mechanisms to fill the gap are also under review and will be contingent on further developments at EU level. <\/p>  <p>  Under the resettlement part of the Programme, 520 refugees are to be resettled in Ireland by the end of 2016.  To date, 500 of these refugees have been admitted to the State, 463 of which are from Syria.  Sufficient cases have already been selected during a mission to Lebanon earlier this year to ensure that the remaining refugees in the overall quota of 520 will be taken in ahead of schedule.  In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 260 refugees from Lebanon in 2017.  The possibility of an additional refugee pledge in 2017 is under active consideration. <\/p>  <p>  Under relocation, Ireland has to date taken in a total of 109 asylum seekers from Greece, mostly families.  69 of these are from Syria.  A further 128 people have been assessed and cleared for arrival and arrangements for their travel to the State are currently being made.  Next week a team of IRPP officials are travelling to Athens to carry out assessment interviews on a further 87 people and a further mission in December will see at least another 80 people interviewed.  By the end of 2016, it is expected that Ireland will have accepted over 400 people from Greece alone under the relocation pledge system.  The intention thereafter is to sustain the pace and size of pledges and intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meet its commitments within the timeframes envisaged under the EU Relocation Decisions.   <\/p>  <p>  There have been well documented delays which have hampered the EU relocation mechanism and the T&aacute;naiste is on record as stating that the pace of arrivals during previous months has been a lot slower than she or I would have liked.  The  delays have been experienced by the majority of participating States, not just Ireland, and are due to issues   outside of our control.  They include issues such as inadequate resources and administration on the ground in Greece, technical issues regarding security assessments in Italy, and a reluctance on the part of migrants to apply for asylum at migration hotspots which is a pre-requisite for entering the relocation programme.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has been concerned at the slow pace of intake.  In this regard, officials in the Department of Justice and Equality have worked closely with the Greek and Italian authorities to resolve these issues.  In June this year a team of Irish officials travelled to Athens to help Greek authorities to identify ways of addressing administrative obstacles and to devise a more ambitious schedule for relocations from Greek hotspots to Ireland.  Irish officials also helped to develop and deliver information sessions for potential relocation applicants aimed at encouraging them to take up places on offer in Ireland rather than remaining in limbo as unregistered migrants.  As regards the issues affecting relocations from Italy I have spoken directly to a relevant ministerial colleague on the matter and Department officials have been liaising with Italian colleagues in Rome and the EU Commission in Brussels in order to address remaining issues.<\/p>  <p>  Both I and the T&aacute;naiste are satisfied that the pace of the programme is accelerating towards full operation at last, however, we must not remain complacent.  Getting these vulnerable people to Ireland is just the first part of the challenge.

No. 383 of 2016, I commenced those provisions of Part 1 and Part 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 as necessary to get the new Regulatory Authority up and running, particularly in terms of its membership and appointment.  On 29 September 2016, I signed the Order appointing 1 October 2016 as the official &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; of the Regulatory Authority as provided under section 7 of the 2015 Act - S.I. No. 507 of 2016 refers.  In conjunction with these initial steps the nomination, approval and appointment procedures for the eleven members of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority set out in Part 2 of the 2015 Act have been completed.  This has included the required resolutions approving such appointment having been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  Dr. Don Thornhill has also been appointed as Chairperson of the Regulatory Authority.  The Authority, which has a lay majority and Chairperson, held its inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016.  I had the opportunity to meet with the members of the Authority to mark this historic occasion which I have warmly welcomed as a key step towards the realisation of the important reforms to the provision of legal services and to the transparency of legal costs that are contained in the 2015 Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Now that the new Authority has had its inaugural meeting as an independent statutory regulator, the working focus is, of necessity, on the managed roll-out of the Authority's functions in tandem with the phased commencement, by the Government, of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act.  This is no mean endeavour as the setting of establishment day of the Authority for 1 October 2016 has automatically triggered a number of working obligations on the new Authority.  Moreover, several of these are statute-bound in terms of their delivery deadlines and in terms of the completion of public consultations and reports on the specified matters concerned.  These are tasks for which the new Authority will need to build up its working resources in the short term.  Both my Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely by way of ensuring that we can successfully coordinate the commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Against this background, it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining Parts of the 2015 Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year and into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings such as the start-up of the Authority&rsquo;s critical public complaints function.  The immediate focus includes the phased commencement of Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers, Pre-Action Protocols and of the miscellaneous provisions of Part 15 to which Deputy O'Callaghan has referred.  Following this, in the new year, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced in tandem with the developing resource base and capability of the new body.  As Deputy Kehoe has anticipated, the successful commencement of the public complaints functions will be central to the new regulatory framework.  I would anticipate that the planning and progress of all of these matters will come to be determined in much more precise terms by my Department in conjunction with the Legal Services Regulatory Authority over the coming weeks. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200061#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200061#WRD03050"},{"type":"question","counter":209,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[32991\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200061#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the case of a person (details supplied) who has lived here for 19 years, who applied to remain in the state and was refused; if it will be reviewed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":210,"content":"<p>I have been informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned was refused permission to remain in the State, on the basis of a change in circumstances on 7 September 2016.<\/p><p>In accordance with the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification dated 31 December 2013, where an application is refused, the applicant may appeal to INIS.

The treaty is based on the credit method of relief, i.e. both countries impose tax on inheritances under their own domestic law and, in relation to property, the country where the property is situated generally has primary taxing rights, with the country imposing tax for some other reason (for example, based on the residence of the disponer\/beneficiary) giving credit for the tax payable in the country where the property is situated. <\/p>  <p>  There are two important dates that are relevant for the taxation of an inheritance in Ireland.  These dates are used for different purposes and have separate status. Firstly, the date of death of a disponer is the date by reference to which the Group Thresholds and tax rates are determined.  Therefore, whatever thresholds and rates are in force on this date apply for the purpose of taxing the value of an inheritance.  Secondly, the date on which probate or administration is granted is generally used as the 'valuation date'.  These rules are based on statute and are strictly applied.  The valuation date is the date on which the value of the assets\/property comprising the inheritance is to be established.  This value is then compared to the relevant Group Threshold and the tax rate applied as appropriate on any excess of the market value over the threshold.  This date also determines when any inheritance tax is to be paid and a tax return submitted to Revenue.  The UK applies a different treatment in that the estate of the deceased person is valued at the date of death.<\/p>  <p>  As with any tax or duty, key dates relating to the charging and administration of a particular tax or duty are given a statutory basis.  This is a necessary part of any taxation system and ensures that both taxpayers and tax authorities have certainty in relation to the rules that determine how tax is to be charged.  To vary these dates as the values of, say, shares, property, or currency fluctuate, or depending on how particular taxpayers are impacted by such fluctuations, would make for a very arbitrary and uncertain taxation system and would ultimately undermine the tax system.  As with any value fluctuations, there will be both winners and losers and, unfortunately, for this particular person the recent sterling volatility has resulted in a higher than expected tax liability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200062#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Knowledge Development Box","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200062#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[32725\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200062#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if Ireland's knowledge development box scheme is compatible with the EU's proposed common consolidated corporate tax base; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>The European Commission's proposal for a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base was published on 25 October.\u00a0 This is a Commission proposal which has not yet been discussed or considered by Member States.\u00a0 The proposal will now be discussed by Member States and it is likely to be subject to significant reshape and renegotiation as these discussions progress.\u00a0 These discussions are likely to go on for some time given the highly technical and complex nature of the proposals. \u00a0Ultimately, the unanimous agreement of all Member States will be needed before any common corporate tax base or any consolidated tax base\u00a0could be introduced.\u00a0 As these discussions have not even\u00a0begun, it is impossible to state with any certainty at this time whether the Knowledge Development Box or any similar patent box incentives would ultimately be compatible with any common consolidated corporate tax base that is eventually agreed by all Member States.\u00a0\u00a0What is certain is that the Knowledge Development Box is fully compliant with the internationally agreed rules for such incentives, namely the OECD \"modified nexus\".\u00a0  These rules were agreed at the OECD as part of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project and have also been endorsed by all EU Member States through the EU Code of Conduct group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200062#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Interdepartmental Working Groups","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200062#WRE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[32815\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200062#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group has completed its report; the current status of the matter; his views on ensuring that flood insurance cover is provided in areas where OPW flood relief schemes have been completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>An Inter-Departmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group has been  established to examine the issue of flooding, and to ensure a whole of Government approach in the area of Flood Policy.

A previous Fianna\u00a0F&aacute;il led Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Fine Gael\/Labour\u00a0Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The recent agreement with TUI and INTO in the context of the Lansdowne Road Agreement substantially addresses the current difference in pay between those recruited since 2011 and those recruited since 2012 and will mean a significant pay increase for new entrant teachers.  It is estimated that over a teacher&rsquo;s career the value of these increases will be &euro;135,000.\u00a0 This, in combination with measures already agreed and implemented under the Haddington Road Agreement, will restore approximately three quarters of the reductions for new entrants put in place since 2011 in terms of career earnings. <\/p>  <p>  The full year cost of this agreement is &euro;20 million.<\/p>  <p>  When other Lansdowne Road increases are also factored in, there will be a 15% increase in the starting pay of new entrant teachers between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;35,602).\u00a0 For an individual TUI\/INTO member who started teaching in September 2015, they will see a 22% increase in their pay (including increment) between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;37,723).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, it must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement on new entrant pay shows what is possible through dialogue and negotiation within the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  The Government is wholly committed to the implementation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement as the most appropriate way for progress to be made on pay restoration and reform of our public services into the future.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has committed to establishing a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200062#WRE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Appeals","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200062#WRE04600"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[32809\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200062#WRE04700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will examine the matter of redressing the refused appeal.","asker":"1327","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>As part of a comprehensive customer service and communications strategy provided by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), to ensure that all necessary avenues are open to applicants to receive the information they need, a dedicated email and phone line service is provided by SUSI for Oireachtas members.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

Some of the actions as part of the plan are to strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents by:<\/p><p>- Restoring capitation funding over a three-year period as resources permit<\/p><p>- Increasing the financial support for book rental schemes, in order to reduce or eliminate school book costs for parents<\/p><p>- Issuing a new circular to school authorities and ETBs regarding school uniform policy and other costs and the need to put a greater emphasis on reducing the cost of school uniforms and other costs.<\/p><p>Budget 2017 represents the start of a major programme of reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade. <\/p><p>It was not possible to provide additional funding in Budget 2017 in relation to this element of the Action Plan due to the many competing demands for the available funding.  However, this commitment remains a priority for me to address as soon as possible during the lifetime of the Action Plan.  It is important to note that the total allocation to this Department for additional policy measures, after demographics and Industrial Relations commitments, was &euro;130 million and of which all our commitments in higher and further education and primary and secondary schools had to be funded.<\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s position in relation to voluntary contributions is that they are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay.  I have no plans to alter this position so long as schools ensure that the contributions are sought in a manner that makes this clear to all concerned.<\/p><p>Separately, the Deputy will be aware that the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which was published on 6 July 2016, contains a provision prohibiting the charging of fees or seeking payment or contributions for an application for admission to a school or for the enrolment or continued enrolment of a student in a school.<\/p><p>I also intend to introduce a stronger complaints procedure and a charter for parents.  It is important that schools should consult parents on matters relating to their children's education, including those matters which have cost implications, and schools should be responsive to the views and concerns of parents.  In that regard requiring schools to have a parent charter will ensure that schools will interact better with parent associations and with individual parents.<\/p><p>I plan to make an announcement shortly on draft legislation that will replace Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998 and require every school to publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter in accordance with national guidelines.  These guidelines will be published after consultation with the education partners. <\/p><p>I believe that these actions will significantly strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200063#WRF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Administration","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200063#WRF02100"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[32628\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200063#WRF02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the national policy in relation to allowing children who avail of school transport to a rural school remain in the school until 3 p.m. when they finish at 2 p.m. and where the school bus only travels once at 3 p.m.; the action families can take if a school does not permit the children to remain on the premises until 3 p.m. and where they hold a bus ticket but cannot avail of the school transport due to a change in policy by the school; if school transport will be provided at 2 p.m. for these children who have an entitlement to school transport and who hold valid tickets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department. <\/p><p>Currently, in the region of 114,000 children, including some 10,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported in over 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually.<\/p><p>One of the main objectives of the School Transport Scheme is to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible children have a reasonable level of service while at the same time, ensuring that school transport vehicles are fully utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.<\/p><p>In this regard, Bus &Eacute;ireann generally plan and timetable school transport services for children who are in attendance for the full school day.<\/p><p>Children in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day.

The ASTI action to withdraw from S&amp;S duties from 7 November makes widespread school closures inevitable from that date.  This is because ASTI have refused to provide the necessary cooperation to allow workable contingency arrangements to be put in place. \u00a0Their standing committee considered the request of the Department for co-operation and took a firm decision to reject this.\u00a0 Nevertheless, as part of our obligation to do everything possible to support schools to stay open after 7 November, we are supporting schools to recruit other people to carry out this supervision and substitution.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Where schools close as a result of ASTI&rsquo;s withdrawal from supervision and substitution duties, teachers who have not made themselves available for S and S will not be paid for those days.  It is normal industrial relations practice that, where workers in industrial action withdraw from core elements of their work, resulting in the closure of the workplace, that those workers would not be paid for those days.<\/p>  <p>  I have continually stated that dialogue between my Department and the ASTI is in the best interests of schools, parents, students and teachers.\u00a0 My Department\u00a0has been having ongoing discussions with the ASTI in relation to issues of concern and talks are continuing this week. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to new entrant teachers, there is a deal on offer to ASTI which would see pay increases of 15% and 22% for new entrant teachers, with further benefits in terms of working conditions, and a route to further possible improvements after that through the Public Pay Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Under the proposed deal for new entrant teachers which is being implemented for the INTO and the TUI and which is potentially on offer to the ASTI:<\/p>  <p>  - The starting pay for new entrant members will increase by 15% between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;35,602).<\/p>  <p>  - An individual member recruited since 1 September 2015 will see a 22% increase in their pay between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;37,723).<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the withdrawal from supervision and substitution, there is also a deal on the table which would see payments for supervision and substitution restored, as well as a whole series of other benefits if ASTI agree to carry out the 33 &lsquo;Croke Park Hours&rsquo; and suspend their industrial action. <\/p>  <p>  This is at the heart of this dispute &ndash; less than an hour a week, agreed in previous public pay deals, to allow schools host planning meetings and parent teacher meetings outside of school time. \u00a0Similar hours are worked across the public service &ndash; in fact most public servants agreed to 100 extra hours per year, compared to 33 per year in the education sector. <\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, ASTI have refused this offer thus far, but it remains open to them.

Talks between ASTI and my Department are continuing this week.  I have continually stated that dialogue between my Department and ASTI is in the best interests of schools, parents, students and teachers.  I hope that parties can re-engage urgently with a view to working towards a resolution in order to avoid further disruption from Monday onwards.  This is an unnecessary dispute in my view as the issues in the dispute have been dealt with in deals with other unions.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that ASTI currently have four separate disputes with the Department.  Within these particular issues there are two separate industrial actions on two separate issues causing the current stoppages in the ASTI dispute:<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the series of one-day strikes by ASTI members on the issue of new entrant pay &ndash; starting last Thursday 27 October and continuing on six additional days from Tuesday 8 November.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, the withdrawal from supervision and substitution duties (i.e. substituting for absent colleagues and supervising yards\/communal areas etc. before and after school and at break times) on an indefinite basis starting from Monday 7 November.  Since the Haddington Road Agreement, these duties are a core part of teachers&rsquo; duties, as set out in a Department circular at that time. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to new entrant teachers - there is a deal on offer to ASTI which would see pay increases of 15% and 22% for new entrant teachers.  The recent agreement reached with TUI and INTO in effect reverses the decision to withdraw qualification allowances from post-1 February 2012 entrant teachers. <\/p>  <p>  When other Lansdowne Road increases are also factored in, there will be a 15% increase in the starting pay of new entrant teachers between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;35,602).  For an individual TUI\/INTO member who started teaching in September 2015, they will see a 22% increase in their pay (including increment) between 31 August 2016 and 1 January 2018 (from &euro;31,009 to &euro;37,723).  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the withdrawal from supervision and substitution - there is also a deal on the table which would see payments for supervision and substitution restored, as well as a whole series of other benefits.<\/p>  <p>  I have offered on several occasions to suspend the implementation of measures associated with ASTI's repudiation of the Lansdowne Road Agreement, if the union suspend their directive to withdraw from the Croke Park hours.  This would provide a more constructive context for talks to take place.  It would also mean that thousands of ASTI teachers would receive the payment for supervision and substitution as well as other benefits and protections, under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, including:<\/p>  <p>- Avoiding a 2 year increment freeze;<\/p>  <p>- Addition of the S&amp;S allowance of &euro;1,592 into the teacher pay scale;<\/p>  <p>- The Ward Report measures and a revised sequence for filling posts which enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more easily and quickly than before;<\/p>  <p>- Continued alleviation of the FEMPI Act pay reductions;<\/p>  <p>- An increase in the quantum of the Croke Park hours that can be worked on other than a whole-school basis;<\/p>  <p>- A review of the usage of the Croke Park hours; and<\/p>  <p>- Protection against compulsory redundancy.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, ASTI have refused this offer thus far, but it remains open to them.<\/p>  <p>  The Croke Park hours are at the heart of this dispute &ndash; less than an hour a week, agreed in previous public service pay deals, to allow schools host planning meetings and parent teacher meetings outside of school time.  Similar hours are worked across the public service.  In fact, most public servants agreed to work 100 extra hours per year, compared to the 33 per year for teachers.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the withdrawal from S&amp;S from 7 November, this obviously poses a serious health and safety concern.

In February 2013, the National Directorate published the Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) policy document which is the blueprint for the direction of fire safety and fire services, aimed at delivering consistent, effective and quality fire services in Ireland.  KCS aims to continue to reduce the risk from fires in our communities and to prioritise the safety of fire personnel in their work.<\/p>  <p>  On 17 December 2015, a new national agreement was signed between fire service management and staff representatives on further implementation of KCS.  The agreement provided for the replacement of the Consultative Committee element of the National Directorate&rsquo;s original structure.  A new Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group (FSNOIG) structure, comprised of employers&rsquo; and employees&rsquo; representatives, has been established and brought into operation in 2016. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department published a report titled Fire Services in Ireland Local Delivery &ndash; National Consistency.  This is the first report of a new external validation process on fire risk management in Ireland arising from implementation of KCS.  The report examines and reports conclusions on the four specific areas of enquiry - Area Risk Categorisation; Fire Safety; Fire Service Operations and Major Emergency Management; and Health and Safety Management.  The report concludes with an overview of themes and issues before making some recommendations for future directions.  Among the main conclusions of this report are: <\/p>  <p>-  Ireland is in the league of safest countries in respect of fatalities caused by fire, with a three year average rate of 6.4 fire deaths per million of population in the years under consideration.  There is, however, no room for complacency on this aspect, as each death is one too many and there are indications of a reversal of the downward trend; <\/p>  <p>-  Fire Services are applying and refining internationally-recognised risk management approaches to reduce the fire risk and the annual toll of life and property loss caused by fire.  Local authorities are matching the assessed fire risk in their individual fire station areas with services based on both full-time and retained fire service models, with a comprehensive support infrastructure, and applying a range of appropriate fire prevention and fire protection approaches; <\/p>  <p>-  Local authorities have benchmarked their fire services against national standards and national norms and a strong degree of consistency, linked to area risk categorisation, now exists in fire service provision; all local authorities are using, or are working towards, national norms as minimum standards; <\/p>  <p>-  Local authority and fire service management are highly cognisant of their statutory responsibilities to ensure the safety, health and welfare of their staff.  They are working to appropriate national guidance, as well as internationally accepted norms, to achieve necessary cultural change.  Local authority fire services have been recognised as leaders of best practice in safety management by independent assessors; <\/p>  <p>-  Ireland&rsquo;s fire services are in a transition process from what might be characterised as a self-contained, individual focus to a position where collaboration with each other and partnerships with other branches of local government and other statutory and voluntary sectors are seen as key to achieving the objective of safe communities.  Although services are at different stages along the road to transition, and further improvement is required in a number of identified areas, the public are served well by the evolved arrangements and can retain confidence in the integrity and professionalism of those with responsibility for managing and delivering fire safety and fire services in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200064#WRG06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax","counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200064#WRG06200"},{"type":"question","counter":440,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[32526\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200064#WRG06300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the reason a person who is taxing a van first registered in 2009 as a private vehicle is required to tax it based on its engine capacity rather than its CO2 emmissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":441,"content":"<p>Motor tax based on carbon emissions was introduced by the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Act 2008.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not involve the award of credits.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that, in most cases, the banded nature of the yearly average system means that there would not be a change in entitlements if post-1994 homemaking periods were calculated as being credits, rather than disregards.  For example, if someone had 30 years contributions over 48 years, with a 12 year homemaking period from 1994-2006, their current yearly average (43.3) would attract the same 98% rate of payment as the rate if they instead had homemaker credits, which would give them a yearly average of 45.5.  In most cases, current pensioners would not have homemakers scheme absences of that duration, and the difference in outcomes would be smaller again.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200066#WRJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[32812\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200066#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will review the current criteria and extend the homemaker scheme to include years before 1994, as the current qualifying criteria is too limited and excludes the vast majority of women who left the workforce prior to 1994 to raise their children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":566,"content":"<p>The State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system.

Our preparations over the coming weeks include closer political and official engagement with Northern Ireland and the British Government and a broadening dialogue with civic society.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, an all-island Civic Dialogue on Brexit will commence, with the initial meeting being hosted by the Taoiseach and myself, today 2 November, in Dublin.  A broad range of civic society groups, trade unions, business groups and non-governmental organisations are participating as well as representatives of political parties on the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200067#WRK06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":653,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200067#WRK06900"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[32912\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200067#WRK07000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the amount that his Department spent on external legal advice in each of the years 2013, 2014 and 2015; the names of each of the legal firms that provided advice to his Department in each of those years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>My Department generally seeks advice on domestic legal matters from the Office of the Attorney General and\/or the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.<\/p>  <p>  Depending on the subject-matter, litigation is dealt with on my Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office or the State Claims Agency which engage lawyers to act for the Department where necessary, including for personal injuries claims and other matters.

In 2006, the McKinsey report, Children&rsquo;s Health First, recommended that the population of Ireland and projected demand could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric centre, that this should be in Dublin and that it should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, to ensure relevant sub-specialty and academic linkages.  The McKinsey report recognised the importance for quality of healthcare of having a critical mass of sub-specialist skills in a tertiary centre and stated this could be achieved firstly, by serving a large enough population to support a full complement of sub-specialists and secondly, by co-locating with an adult teaching hospital thus enabling access to specialties that encompass both adult and paediatric patients, facilitating clinical and academic &ldquo;cross fertilisation&rdquo;, and attracting the top staff.<\/p><p>Reviews since 2006 have reaffirmed the importance of co-location with a major adult academic teaching hospital. In 2011, the then Minister, Senator Reilly, established an Independent Review Group to examine the project at the Mater.  The clinical aspect of this review was carried out by a team of four Chief Executive Officers drawn from the National Association of Children&rsquo;s Hospitals (NACHRI) and the Children&rsquo;s Hospitals International Executive Forum (CHIEF).  Their report stated that <i>&ldquo;co-locating with tertiary adult and maternity hospitals is essential to the development of an excellent paediatric service.  This has become best practice internationally and was recognized in the McKinsey report.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>In 2012, following the refusal of planning permission for the project at the Mater campus, Minister Reilly established the Dolphin Review Group to advise on next steps.  Their report stated that <i>&ldquo;Having reviewed the reports already prepared and considered their analysis and opinions, and having also consulted with a wide range of professionals in the field, we are also of the view that co-location is essential and tri-location optimal.  We recommend that the Minister remains on this path.&rdquo;<\/i>It identified St James&rsquo;s as the most suitable adult partner for the new children&rsquo;s hospital, from a clinical and research perspective.<\/p><p>The Government decision to co-locate the hospital with St James's was announced on 6 November 2012.  In identifying the location, the Government considered the report of the Dolphin Group, and detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.  The decision was made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations paramount in the decision.  As announced in June 2015, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate to the campus in time, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers.  In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, which are readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus.  Also, tri-location that delivers the most significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site will enhance the potential of research to drive best clinical outcomes.  St James's Hospital has the broadest range of national specialties of all acute hospitals, as well as a strong and well established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner.<\/p><p>A significant upgrade of Connolly Hospital would be required to achieve the same potential for quality of clinical outcomes as co-location\/tri-location with St James's.  As set out in the Dolphin report, Connolly Hospital would need very substantial investment of human and capital resources to develop over time into an adult tertiary hospital with critical mass supported by leading edge research facilities, additional to the capital cost of developing the children's hospital itself on the campus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200069#WRM03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Health Insurance Card","counter":757,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200069#WRM03900"},{"type":"question","counter":758,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[32580\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200069#WRM04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the safeguards in place to avoid abuse of the European health card system in accessing medical care here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1252","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":759,"content":"<p>Under EU Regulations, all persons ordinarily resident in the EU are entitled to apply for a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC).

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.<\/p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p>  <p>- Bed and board;<\/p>  <p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p>  <p>- Laundry service.<\/p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  Other medical or therapy services such as chiropody are not funded by the NHSS.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involved effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, e.g. social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<\/p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  <\/p>  <p>  The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, published in July 2015, looked at the issue of additional costs in private nursing homes and made the following recommendations:<\/p>  <p>- Nursing homes should have a published fee schedule showing all the costs associated with being a  resident.<\/p>  <p>- Consideration should be given to introducing a new provision under the scheme to prohibit the levying of additional charges for any service or facility from which residents can not readily opt out without penalty while remaining as residents of that facility, or in which they cannot participate because of their level of dependency.<\/p>  <p>- Consideration should be given to including in the price contracts with facilities, details of what additional charges are proposed, of the opt-out arrangements that exist for residents and confirmation that residents will not be charged for extra services that they cannot participate in because of their dependency or lack of capacity.<\/p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  A specific date has not been set for the Group to conclude its work, but an initial report on its progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200070#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HIQA Inspections","counter":813,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200070#WRN01550"},{"type":"question","counter":814,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[32591\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200070#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of HIQA inspections carried out in private nursing homes in 2013, 2014, 2015 and to date in 2016; the number of nursing homes which were required to make improvements and whether these improvements have taken place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":815,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[32592\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200070#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of HIQA inspections carried out in public nursing homes in 2013, 2014, 2015 and to date in 2016; the number of nursing homes which were required to make improvements; if these improvements have taken place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[32593\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200070#WRN01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the protection that exists for persons who are accessing nursing home care via the fair deal scheme when substandard care is reported by HIQA; the measures he is taking to address the standards and quality in fair deal scheme nursing homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":817,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 301, 303 and 304 together.<\/p><p>The Health Information and Quality Authority is the independent authority established under the Health Act 2007 to drive continuous improvement and to monitor safety and quality in Ireland&rsquo;s health and personal social care services.  Since 2009 all nursing homes - public, voluntary and private have been registered and inspected by HIQA.  <\/p><p>The functions of the Minister for Health in relation to HIQA and the Chief Inspector of Social Services are prescribed in the Act, and in this respect the Chief Inspector is independent in the exercise of these functions.<\/p><p>This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive framework, including the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People<\/i>and the Health Act, 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations, 2013.  New National Standards, which were approved earlier this year, are based on the legislation.  The Standards set out what is expected in terms of the service provided to residents, with a focus on continuous development of safe and effective care.<\/p><p>It is the responsibility of HIQA to assess whether residential services are providing high quality, safe and effective services and supports to residents, and to ensure that any issues or deficits are addressed to the satisfaction of the Authority.  HIQA&rsquo;s programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections helps to ensure that standards are maintained and where issues of non-compliance arise that these are addressed and rectified.  The findings of all monitoring inspections are set out under a maximum of 18 outcome statements.  The outcomes inspected against are dependent on the purpose of the inspection.  In contrast, thematic inspections focus in detail on one or more outcomes.  This focused approach facilitates services to continuously improve and achieve improved outcomes for residents of designated centres.<\/p><p>Following an inspection providers are required to complete an action plan, setting out how they intend to address any non-compliance found by the inspectors and a timescale for doing so.  The action plan is appended to the inspection report and both are published on HIQA's website .  If a nursing home is found not to be in compliance with the Regulations it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status.  HIQA also has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of registration on nursing homes.<\/p><p>HIQA publishes an overview report of its regulatory programme and findings in designated centres for older persons annually.  The latest report covered the period 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015.  A total of 411 nursing home inspections were carried out last year in 343 registered residential centres across the country, with almost half of all inspections being unannounced.

Over the last number of years, there has been a marked increase in awareness of the condition among GPs and hospital doctors in Ireland.  Each of the HSE&rsquo;s hospital Groups have a number of Infectious Disease Consultants who are expert in the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease.  Our laboratories operate to high levels of quality.  Anyone who has been bitten by a tick or has other reasons to strongly suspect Lyme disease should discuss their concerns with their GP in the first instance. <\/p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis was made been statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment Regulations) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  The notifiable entity is Lyme neuroborreliosis, the more severe neurological form of Lyme borreliosis.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE collects and collates surveillance data on notifiable infectious diseases.  The number of annual neuroborreliosis notifications over the last few years is as follows:<\/p>  <p>- 2012 &ndash; 8 cases;<\/p>  <p>- 2013 &ndash; 13 cases;<\/p>  <p>- 2014 &ndash; 18 cases; and<\/p>  <p>- 2015 &ndash; 12 cases.<\/p>  <p>  The Weekly Infectious Disease Report, published by the HPSC on 26 October 2016, indicated that for week 42-2016 (16-10\/16-22-10\/16) there have been 16 cases notified so far in 2016 &ndash; an increase of 5 on the same period last year.<\/p>  <p>  This gives an annual incidence rate of about 2.7 cases per million population.  The number of people affected by milder forms of Lyme disease is not known.  The ratio of neuroborreliosis to standard Lyme disease ranges from 5%-20%, so it is quite possible that Ireland could have between 100-200 cases of Lyme disease per annum.<\/p>  <p>  HPSC Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee<\/p>  <p>  The HPSC is responsible for the surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases such as Lyme Disease.  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer. <\/p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:<\/p>  <p>- To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;<\/p>  <p>- To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the general public;<\/p>  <p>- To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international practice;<\/p>  <p>- To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;<\/p>  <p>- To develop strategies to raise awareness among the general public particularly in areas of higher tick populations; and<\/p>  <p>- To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.<\/p>  <p>  The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involves a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland for general practitioners, and ongoing work in drawing together the Final Report of the Sub-committee.  The Sub-committee includes representation from Tick Talk, an independent Lyme disease support group set up to encourage awareness, prevention and treatment of the disease in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee first met on 6 May 2015 and it is expected to report in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Testing for Lyme Disease<\/p>  <p>  Irish microbiology laboratories that test for Lyme disease all comply with internationally recognised quality assurance schemes.  There schemes are designed to monitor how the laboratories operate and to ensure that the quality of laboratory reports can be guaranteed.  These quality assurance schemes involve the operation of the laboratories being independently monitored and assessed by Irish and international specialist microbiology reviewers to examine the laboratories use of accredited examination procedures and methods that will ensure the highest achievable quality of all tests performed and thus to ensure that the laboratories operate to a the highest possible standards of quality.<\/p>  <p>  No laboratory test will however be 100% accurate 100% of the time, and, occasionally, diagnoses can be missed, but the purpose of the quality assurance scheme for laboratories is to ensure that the likelihood of a misdiagnosis is minimised.  This will involve minimising the number of false positive results (i.e. people being diagnosed as having Lyme disease when they in fact do not have the disease) and false negative results (i.e. people being diagnosed as not having Lyme disease when they in fact have the disease). <\/p>  <p>  It is important that patients who are concerned about Lyme disease seek help and a firm diagnosis in Ireland.  There have been many instances of patients travelling to other countries to undergo extremely expensive testing only to be given an incorrect diagnosis of Lyme disease, when they most likely had a completely unrelated condition which could be diagnosed simply and accurately within the Irish health system.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a real danger in looking at Lyme disease in isolation (i.e. looking at only the results of a Lyme blood test).  When a doctor takes a history and examines a patient, he\/she does so with an open mind.  He\/she is gathering evidence (in terms of the patient&rsquo;s clinical history, physical examination and laboratory tests) to determine which diagnoses are most likely.  It is the combination of careful clinical history, examination and appropriate laboratory testing that will lead a doctor to making a correct diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that Lyme testing is applied in a valid and accurate, a two stage system is used.  <\/p>  <p>  First stage (EIA Testing): This test detects antibodies to Lyme disease (Lyme antibodies are markers that show that a person has been exposed to the bug causing Lyme disease at some stage in the past).  However studies that have tested large groups (populations) of people have found that anything from 5% to 20% of these groups can have positive Lyme tests.  What this means is that a significant minority people have been, at some stage in their lives, exposed to Lyme Borrelia.  The initial screening EIAs can be quite inaccurate, giving false-positive reactions (i.e. the tests indicate the patient has had Lyme disease when in fact they have not).  Infections such as syphilis, certain viral infections including glandular fever and certain inflammatory conditions can give positive Lyme disease tests and if these results are not double checked, the patient will have been falsely diagnosed as having Lyme disease when they in fact do not have the disease.  To get around this problem, the second stage of testing &ndash; Western Blot &ndash; is used.<\/p>  <p>  Second Stage (Western Blot): If a patient&rsquo;s blood test results come back as being positive (or questionable) for Lyme disease, their blood is tested using the Western Blot method.  Using the Western Blot greatly increases the specificity of the testing (i.e. the very specific Western Blot out-rules false positives and identifies a very high proportion of true Lyme disease cases making the two tier system very accurate).<\/p>  <p>  Treatment<\/p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2006.  This pharmacological regime can be summarised thus:<\/p>  <p>- Doxycycline, amoxicillin or cefuroxime for the treatment of adults with early localised or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations (ceftriaxone in early Lyme disease for adults with acute neurologic disease manifested by meningitis or radiculopathy);<\/p>  <p>- Doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime for adults with Lyme arthritis but without clinical evidence of neurologic disease; <\/p>  <p>- For late neurological disease in adults - intravenous ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or Penicillin G.<\/p>  <p>  Prevention<\/p>  <p>  Prevention is better than cure and there are a number of measures people can take to protect themselves from catching this disease.  The best protection is to prevent tick bites, when walking in grassy, bushy or woodland areas, particularly between May and October:<\/p>  <p>- Arms and leg should be covered; wearing long trousers tucked into socks or boots, and long-sleeved shirts with cuffs fastened is advised.  Shoes or boots should be worn rather than open-toed sandals.<\/p>  <p>- The use of insect repellent on clothes is recommended, or on limbs if it is not practicable to cover up.

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200071#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme","counter":875,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200071#WRO01050"},{"type":"question","counter":876,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[32715\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200071#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the changes to the fair deal scheme in budget 2017, particularly in respect of asset value of farm land; if any further changes are proposed to the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":877,"content":"<p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  <\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;940 million will be available for the Scheme in 2017.  This is an increase of &euro;18.5million on the projected outturn for 2016.  In line with the commitment contained in the Programme for a Partnership Government the funding provided will mean that approved applicants will have access to funding within approximately 4 weeks.  The Scheme will support an additional 500 people in 2017 increasing the number supported to just over 23,600 by the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  In advance of the Review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies who wished to make a contribution, and the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) made a submission in this context on which they expanded at a subsequent meeting with officials of the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental\/Agency Working Group has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the Review.  This group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I have recently met with the IFA and invited them to present their submission at the next meeting of the Working Group.  The Working Group met on the 11 of October and the IFA gave a verbal presentation to the Group.

However, since it does not have psychoactive properties it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  <\/p>  <p>  While I am aware that CBD oil is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement, it should be noted that it is not authorised as a medicinal product in Ireland.  Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or, in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency.  A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicinal product is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.  I have no role in the process of authorising medicinal products.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the HPRA has not received any applications for authorisation for any cannabis-based product other than the one authorised in 2014.  If other cannabis-based medications come to market, and the marketing authorisation holder seeks to have the product made available in Ireland, it is likely that further legislative changes may be required to accommodate such a product.<\/p>  <p>  Where a medicinal product is not authorised in Ireland, a licensed wholesaler may import it if it has been prescribed by a doctor for a patient under his\/her care, on his\/her direct responsibility and in order to meet the special needs of a patient.  Therefore, if a CBD oil preparation does not contain an ingredient which is a controlled substance, such as THC, it may be feasible to have that product imported and used in Ireland, in accordance with specific conditions, should a patient&rsquo;s doctor be of the opinion that this is an appropriate treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Patients suffering from Dravets syndrome should firstly discuss treatment options with their consulting doctor.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of permitting the use of cannabis-based products for medical purposes in Ireland is likely to be considered in the context of the new National Drugs Strategy and I understand the Oireachtas Health Committee will consider the matter in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I have met with affected families and am very sympathetic to the situation they are in, and I have also discussed this issue with the HPRA.

Participants contribute according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate setting.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  It is important to note that, regardless of the weekly cost of operating a public nursing home, a resident will only be asked to contribute what has been ascertained by the financial assessment as their weekly contribution under the Scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The Department of Health has no role in such negotiations.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<\/p>  <p> - Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;<\/p>  <p> - Price(s) previously charged;<\/p>  <p> - Local market price; and<\/p>  <p> - Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p>  <p> - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; <\/p>  <p> - Bed and board;<\/p>  <p> - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p>  <p> - Laundry service.<\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a private or voluntary nursing home, e.g. social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.  In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.  However, it should be noted that there are no additional charges for residents in public facilities once their NHSS contribution has been assessed.<\/p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p>  <p> - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p>  <p> - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p>  <p> - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and has commenced its work in this area. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has recently published the cost of care for all public nursing homes.  There are a number of reasons why the costs of public facilities are generally higher than those in the private sector, including a higher nurse staffing ratio and the impact of public service rates of pay and conditions of employment.<\/p>  <p>  The geographical spread of residential placements is also a factor.  In some rural areas long stay beds are provided for geographical reasons in smaller centres which would not be profitable for a private provider to supply, e.g. Achill Island; Donegal.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible, and towards that end the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities.  Differences in the comparative cost of public and private long-term residential care will be the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review to be undertaken by the Department of Health in 2017 to assess reasons for and components of current cost differentials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200072#WRP06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":997,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200072#WRP07000"},{"type":"question","counter":998,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[32980\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200072#WRP07100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a bed will be provided for a person (details supplied) in the Central Mental Hospital;

There are many types and systems of beef production in Ireland currently including but not limited to suckler to steer\/heifer systems, suckler to bull beef\u00a0systems, dairy calf to beef systems, all of which have various different systems within each system.  Furthermore there are a number of production systems which do not involve bringing animals forward for slaughter such as suckler to weanling systems and farmers who market store cattle across a range of ages for other producers to\u00a0finish.<\/p><p>As an example of the range of diversity of the amount of finishing systems in Ireland, Teagasc when updating their Beef Systems Blueprints as part of the Beef Roundtable talks in 2015, produced Blueprints for 13 different finishing beef systems. In that context it is very difficult to calculate an average cost of production that is applicable across beef production in Ireland.  There are many factors which impact on the costs incurred by producers depending on their system of production e.g. the price of concentrates will impact much more heavily on those systems of production which depend more on concentrates in the diets of finishing cattle as opposed to those finishing cattle off grass.<\/p><p>Similarly in terms of\u00a0fixed costs, these can be\u00a0impacted in many instances by the stage of development of a farm with those farms investing heavily in physical infrastructure in the last number of\u00a0years likely to have higher fixed costs\u00a0than those farms who did not require such investment in their facilities. <\/p><p>Teagasc when developing these\u00a0Blueprints formulated a very useful cost of production\u00a0template which producers themselves can use to calculate their own costs of production and use to determine the profitability of each system of production.\u00a0In addition Teagasc also publish an Annual Review and Outlook for each sector in December with a mid-year\u00a0update in July.  The July 2016 update stated the following in relation to 2016 production costs:<\/p><p>-  The direct costs of beef production are dominated by purchased feed and pasture costs.<\/p><p>-  In 2016 due to normal levels of grass availability, purchased feed volumes are not expected to increase.<\/p><p>-  For the year to date energy and fertiliser prices in particular have been lower than in 2015.<\/p><p>-  Feed prices have been largely unchanged compared to 2015, but are forecast to weaken somewhat over the remainder of the year due to cereal and oilseed market developments and the strength of the dollar. <\/p><p>A full link to the Teagasc report can be found at <\/p><p>I am very conscious of the difficulties facing primary producers in the beef sector and my Department is taking all the steps it can to secure\u00a0new market access opportunities for both live animals and processed beef. In addition I have also provided increased funding to Teagasc in Budget 2017\u00a0for its research, education and advisory functions and funding for my Department's Beef Knowledge Transfer programme which is designed to enable farmers to focus on best practices and efficiencies within the farm gate. In addition beef farmers also enjoy\u00a0 a range of supports through the Department's various schemes such as BPS, TAMS, GLAS, ANC and of course the BDGP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200073#WRQ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Management","counter":1026,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200073#WRQ01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1027,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[32518\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200073#WRQ01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the replanting of forestry (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1028,"content":"<p>Following a complaint,\u00a0a Department official has\u00a0visited the site.\u00a0\u00a0The applicant has been notified of the required setback distances that must be observed for dwelling houses and has been advised\u00a0that all trees within this specified setback zones should be removed without delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200073#WRQ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Payments","counter":1029,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200073#WRQ02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1030,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[32578\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200073#WRQ02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of an application for a farm payment in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1031,"content":"<p>The person named submitted a 2016 Basic Payment\/Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme's application on 15 May 2016.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies\u00a0and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie, shows the extent of the State Intervention area:<\/p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.<\/p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention which are the subject of the current procurement process.<\/p>  <p>  Marine Cove in the townland of Ballynacragga North is within the BLUE area and therefore is expected to be covered\u00a0by commercial operators.  Members of the public can view whether their premises in County Limerick are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p>  <p>  While I cannot compel any operator to provide services to a particular premises,\u00a0my Department continues\u00a0to actively monitor the deployment plans in the BLUE area and direct feedback from consumers is important.  In this regard,\u00a0if customers in the Marine Cove area cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dcenr.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services so that my Department may investigate further.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State Intervention Area comprising\u00a0over 750,000 premises in Ireland including over\u00a033,000 premises in County Limerick, covering 100,000 km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland.  Since bidders were invited to participate in dialogue with the Department, there have been approximately 150 hours of meetings, with considerable more interaction to follow over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.<\/p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and \/ or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.

It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.

The Better Energy Homes scheme makes a range of grants available to homeowners who wish to improve the energy efficiency of their home and the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme offers free energy efficiency upgrades to those in energy poverty.I can assure the Deputy that I regard both schemes as core elements of the Government's energy and climate policy and that neither will be\u00a0coming to an end.  In fact, with an allocation of\u00a0&euro;100m in Budget 2017 for\u00a0energy projects, I expect\u00a0SEAI schemes to support the upgrade of up to 30,000 homes in 2017, supporting some 3,000 jobs in the construction sector. <\/p><p>There is no closing date for application to either the Better Energy Homes or the Warmer Homes schemes.<\/p><p>The Better Energy Homes scheme is the elective grant scheme available to homeowners.  Individual homeowners apply for grants that cover a range of energy efficiency improvements, such as\u00a0various types of insulation,\u00a0heating controls and solar thermal technologies.  Homeowners procure their own SEAI-registered contractors to carry out the works on their properties and apply to the SEAI for the grant funding.\u00a0 It is up to homeowners to determine when is the best time of year to complete any works on their home.  The only stipulation when applying for a grant, in relation to timing, is that it should be drawn down within six months of successful application. <\/p><p>Under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, a householder may apply directly to SEAI at any time of the year, provided they meet the eligibility criteria.  Once an application has been received a home must be inspected by SEAI&rsquo;s appointed survey team to determine what works are suitable. The SEAI then assigns homes to their panel of appointed contractors within a number of days.  Completion of works is then dependent on contractor logistics and weather conditions.

In this respect, work is well advanced on developing a policy response to the University of Limerick (UL) study on zero hour contracts and low hour contracts.  The policy response is being informed by the UL study itself and also the extensive material and practical examples provided by respondents to the public consultation conducted by my Department.  The policy response will address the issue of workers on low hour contracts who consistently work more hours each week but whose contracts do not reflect the reality of their hours.  The proposals will also seek to ensure that workers are better informed about the nature of their employment arrangements and their core terms and conditions at an early stage in their employment.  Furthermore the proposals will include provisions aimed particularly at low paid, more vulnerable workers.  My Department is currently engaged in a dialog process with ICTU and Ibec to secure broad agreement before proposals are finalised.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also opposed the Banded Hours Contracts Bill 2016 because it is fundamentally flawed and inappropriate, lacks balance and will not work in practice.  For example, instead of focussing on the issue of low paid vulnerable workers, the Bill requires that all workers in every sector of the economy be given additional hours on request unless the employer can prove they are in &ldquo;severe financial difficulties&rdquo;.  The Bill does not provide a basis for addressing issues relating to the protection of low paid vulnerable workers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200077#WRU00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Eligibility","counter":1288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200077#WRU00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1289,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[32552\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200077#WRU00400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if a person (details supplied) currently on a student's visa can apply for a work permit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1290,"content":"<p>A person on a student visa may apply for an Employment Permit subject to all of the usual criteria for an Employment Permit being met.<\/p><p>All applications for Employment Permits are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended and associated regulations and current Employment Permit policy is to only consider new Employment Permit applications for highly skilled, highly paid positions or for positions where there is an officially recognised scarcity of supply in relation to a particular qualification or occupation type.

Negotiators on both sides had a first detailed discussion on the entire text of a proposal by the EU for a dedicated SME chapter.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is fully supportive of the EU&rsquo;s trade negotiations with Japan and continues to support discussions on an ambitious FTA.  An agreement with Japan will open opportunities for Irish exporters and companies across a wide range of sectors as production volumes and investment opportunities increase.  In 2014, Ireland&rsquo;s exports of goods to Japan were valued at &euro;1.8bn, while our service exports were valued at &euro;2.7bn.  This equated to an increase of 5% and 8% respectfully from 2013.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue of growing market share in other markets is made even more important as a result of the recent UK referendum on its membership of the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200077#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":1312,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200077#WRU01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1313,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[32909\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016110200077#WRU02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the amount that her Department spent on external legal advice in each of the years 2013, 2014 and 2015; the names of each of the legal firms that provided advice to her Department in each of those years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1314,"content":"<p>The following tables set out the amount spent on external legal advice in the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.
