As the Chairman said, this sets out our forecasts for Ireland and is the first update of our projections since budget 2018.  It is presented in draft form.  I look forward to hearing the views of the committee members.  The final version will be submitted to Brussels later this month.<\/p> <p>  I wish to emphasise that the macroeconomic forecasts underpinning the stability programme have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The council also welcomes the progress my Department has made towards developing alternative models for its medium-term forecast.<\/p> <p>  Turning first to the economic situation, I am greatly encouraged by the latest data showing that the economy grew by 7.8% last year.  However, I want to emphasise that the headline figure can be exaggerated in an Irish context and other indicators I will be tracking are changes in consumer spending, what is happening in our labour market and changes in tax receipts, all of which point to last year being a year of strong economic growth.<\/p> <p>  My Department has increased its forecast this year to 5.6% reflecting the stronger economic momentum in the second half of last year.  For next year, growth of 4.0% is forecast so the economy, overall, is in good shape.  However, yesterday I stressed that this growth cannot be taken for granted and I want to emphasise that again today while acknowledging also that, for many, these top-line and overall figures do not match the experience of their own personal economy.<\/p><p>The changes and potential changes to which I refer are the UK's impending exit from the EU, changes in the international corporation tax landscape, and rising geopolitical tensions, all of which could derail the recovery.  From 2020 onwards, the economy has the capacity to grow by around 3% per annum.  The economic recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market, with employment growth of 2.9% last year, representing the addition of some 61,000 jobs.  There are now more than 2.2 million people at work for the first time since 2008.  We have now recovered nine out of every ten jobs lost, and the labour market will continue to benefit from strong growth in domestic demand, with employment growth of 2.7% for the year.<\/p><p> On this basis, there will be more people at work in Ireland this year than before.  We expect unemployment to fall further to 5.8% and to 5.3% in 2019, down from a peak of 16%.<\/p><p> Public finances continue to move in the right direction.  In terms of the underlying general Government deficit, progress continues to be made.  I am pleased to outline that, notwithstanding the additional expenditure, as a result of the reclassification of approved housing bodies, the deficit of 0.3% of GDP recorded last year is in line with the budget day estimate.  This provides further evidence that the public finances are becoming increasingly sustainable.  Furthermore, a careful approach to budgetary policy is being implemented, with tax revenue forecast to grow by 6%, while gross voted expenditure is up by 4.5%.  This demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining sound and stable public finances.<\/p><p> Turning to this year, the latest Exchequer returns to the end of the first quarter show that we continue to deliver on our financial targets and commitments.  It is also important to point out that the annual growth has been strong with tax receipts 3.5% higher compared to the same period in 2017 and positive annual growth witnessed across most tax heads.<\/p><p> Turning to expenditure, it is being managed by Departments within their allocations thus far, with overall expenditure slightly below profile by 2.3%.  Capital investment to enhance our growth and address key challenges in our society is slightly behind profile but well up on last year.<\/p><p> For next year, an additional &euro;2.6 billion in expenditure has already been committed.  Included in this is &euro;1.5 billion for additional capital spending, &euro;0.4 billion to provide for demographic-related costs, &euro;0.4 billion for public sector pay and &euro;0.3 billion for carry-over costs associated with measures introduced this year.  A key Government priority is to reduce the level of public indebtedness.  However, it must be acknowledged that the recent evolution of the debt to GDP ratio presents an overly benign view of our pubic indebtedness.  The debt to GDP ratio has decreased only because GDP has increased.  Other measures, notably the ratio of debt to GNI* show that while declining, public debt remains high.  The legacies of the crisis persist with the total stock of debt now standing at &euro;206 billion, with &euro;40,000 worth of debt for every citizen in our State.  It is essential that we begin to reduce this burden.<\/p><p> In conclusion, growth cannot be taken for granted.  There are a number of risks domestically, notwithstanding the well-known limitations with gross domestic product.  The recovery economically continues to outperform expectations, but this, of course, creates its own challenges.  If the economy continues to grow in excess of its potential, capacity constraints will begin to emerge.  For these reasons, I want to be careful with budgetary policy to maintain a careful approach to it and look at measures to improve the competitiveness of our economy, while addressing our many social challenges.  That is what I and  the Government intend to do.  Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#E00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Minister.

I will be brief given the circumstances.  I will just ask a few key questions.  The Government's objective of meeting the medium-term objective, MTO, for 2018 of a structural deficit of not greater than 0.5% is now expected to be missed, according to the stability programme update.  Back in the budget of last October, it was expected that the structural deficit would come in at 0.5% in 2018, but the Minister is now forecasting 0.9%.  What are the consequences, if any, of missing that medium-term objective in 2018?<\/p> <p>  In regard to the risks the Minister has identified on pages 35 and 36, I am curious as to why the risks posed by the ongoing efforts at EU-level to introduce changes to corporate taxation are excluded.  I refer to the proposals around digital taxation and common consolidated corporate tax.  The Minister's Department has assessments about potentially very negative consequences for Ireland, so why are they not listed?<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister accept the reference in yesterday's IMF report, the global economic outlook report, that a quarter of Ireland's growth last year came from the sale of iPhones?  Does the Minister accept that and what are the consequences of that?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister confirm when the summer economic statement will be published?  Will we then have the update on the estimate of fiscal space that will be available in budget 2019?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#F00300","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The summer economic statement will be in early July.  At that point we will be in a position to provide an indication on how we believe the economy will perform next year.  What I will be doing at that point is not just talking about what kind of resources may or may not be available, but I will also be speaking about what I believe will be the right budgetary policy for the economy for next year.  We need to be careful, given where the economy stands at the moment, that we do not look at this purely through a rules-based lens.  We will say more about that later in the year.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the observations of the IMF, it is the case, and I acknowledged it in my opening statement, that a portion of the way in which we traditionally manage and measure economic growth is now being significantly affected by contract manufacturing.  The degree to which we measure our economy is now affected by how integrated it has become with global supply chains.  That is why in the stability programme update, SPU, we have retained the approach of using GNI* and we have now brought in a further measure called modified domestic demand.  We are using that as another way of looking at how we believe the economy is performing in a more appropriate manner.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the corporate tax reference the Deputy made and the SPU.  I said in my statement, and on a number of occasions, that the changing environment in regard to corporate tax policy could at a point in the future affect the environment within which Ireland makes decisions.  Given that I have been very clear on many occasions that I will not agree to a form of a consolidated tax base and will not change the rate of corporate tax policy, the way in which we have now captured the risk is on page 36, where we make reference to the fact that there are potential concentration risks in regard to where receipts from corporate tax policy are concentrated.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the Deputy's first question on the MTO, we are working on this with the European Commission and we believe we will deliver the MTO objective for last year.  What happened was that the performance of the economy in the third and fourth quarters of the year, and particularly the impact of some of the external factors to which I just referred, have affected the calculation of the output gap.  Mr. McCarthy can say something about this later on if the committee wishes him to do so.  In terms of any impact this is going to have on policy decisions or resources, it will not have any for this year and the reason for that is that we are delivering the nominal and topline deficit targets that I outlined on budget day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#F00400","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and Mr. McCarthy to the committee.  The statement makes for interesting reading in terms of us reaching near full employment in the State, with a booming economy, and yet there are so many demands in society.  We need to ensure that this budget meets the needs of society and lifts the pressure off services and off individuals.  To shape that, I ask the Minister to give us some more information, based on the statistics that have been published, on the fiscal space that is available.  There has been a lot of commentary on the fact that &euro;2.6 billion has been spent and people are extrapolating from that there is about &euro;500 million left to be spent, based on what was announced in the summer economic statement and on budget day.  As things stand, knowing that they may change in July when the summer statement is published, what is the fiscal space that is uncommitted at this time?<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that in terms of the medium-term objective, MTO, it will not have any impact this year.  Does that also apply for next year and budget 2019?  Given that we have now missed the MTO for this year but somehow we achieved it last year, will a convergence margin be applied and, if so, how will that impact on the fiscal space of &euro;3.2 billion that was identified at the time of last year's budget?  The Minister mentioned contract manufacturing in response to Deputy Michael McGrath's question and said it was substantial.  Does the Minister believe that it was as substantial as is being stated in the IMF report, that is, that one quarter of our growth last year was as a result of the sale of iPhone products?  Does he believe that this will be a recurring theme in the context of this year's 5.6% growth in the economy?<\/p> <p>  I have serious reservations about what the Minister calls the rainy day fund because a person lying on a trolley today believes it is raining, a person who is homeless tonight knows it is raining, or a child with autism who cannot get a place or even a diagnosis knows it is raining down very heavily.  This is a fund for which we will have to borrow &euro;500 million to set aside.  It was previously announced that this would only happen when the economy was structurally balanced.  Given the fact that we are not now going to be structurally balanced and will be quite significantly off target, at 0.5%, is it the Minister's intention to plough ahead with this and divert &euro;500 million from the types of issues I have just outlined?<\/p> <p>  In terms of risks, one of the areas that was identified as high risk is related to climate change and the fines that the State could be facing by 2020 because of our failure to meet our targets.  Will the Minister give us an update in terms of quantifying that risk in hard euro and cent?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#G00100","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I will take the last question first.  Climate change fines do not form part of any liability that I expect to develop for next year.  I will have to come back to the committee with potential scenarios beyond that, which I will do.  It is correct to say that the potential for liabilities to be created via potential fines is a factor that I am considering, but I have not put figures against it in this.  Were I to do so, I would probably look to do that and to clarify that as a risk in the economic statement, which I will do later on.  I will come back to the committee with a horizon in terms of what those fines could be.<\/p> <p>  Our judgment and information is that the impact of contract manufacturing and some of the activities associated with it could be affecting our nominal top line rates of economic growth by between 1.5% and 2%.  That is why, in this report, I am now talking about modified domestic demand and about GNI* because I believe it would be a fatal mistake to base tax or expenditure policy on those rates of economic growth, particularly given that the correlation between that kind of rate of economic growth and any increase in tax revenue is negligible.  I will ask Mr. McCarthy to address the question about the impact on the convergence factor.  On the fiscal space question and what is committed or uncommitted, I will give an update later in the year regarding resources for next year.

In regard to the &euro;206 billion debt the Minister mentioned, what progress has been made in 2018 and 2019 in refinancing through the NTMA, which we have discussed before a few times?  I know the agency took a few actions early this year.  What impact has that had on the national debt?  The Minister said it is essential that we start to reduce this burden.  What exactly will that mean in 2018 and 2019?<\/p> <p>  I will refer briefly to non-tax revenue.  There is a reference here to the Central Bank, the floating rate notes and revenues in that area.  What might happen to our bank shares is referred to in the risk analysis.  Does the Minister expect any other positive developments on the non-tax revenue side?<\/p> <p>  Colleagues made several references to that extraordinary statistic about Apple.  I recently bought a new iPad.  This is having such a profound impact on our economy that it accounts for a quarter of 2017 growth.  This raises the issue of corporation tax.  The Minister does not highlight a major risk in this area, in spite of the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, and the European plans in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#H00900","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>In answer to the first question about when the Brexit-associated risks will become clearer, I note that there will be a meeting of the European Council in June and another one in October.  We will need to make progress on many of the key issues that matter to Ireland there.  However, my expectation is that many of the things that will affect our economy's performance will begin to crystallise towards the end of this year.  Things that will happen in the UK will affect the British economy and could in turn have a spillover effect beyond what we are considering at the moment.  There are certain things we will be able to influence.  We can do that politically, via the two engagements to which I have referred.  However, there are other things that could happen in the British economy and British society which might well affect the prospects for 2019, 2020 and beyond.  I think that those things will become clearer to us towards the end of the year.  One thing that is worth saying, however, is that it is now far more likely than not that there will be a transitional agreement between the UK and the EU.  It is for that reason that we have increased our growth forecast for next year now to approximately 4%.  That is a change from when we last looked at this.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the figure of &euro;206 billion and the effect of the NTMA thereon, I note that the agency's recent marketplace activity and what has happened over the past year has had two particular effects.  The first is that our real interest rate has now been reduced.  That currently stands at 2.7%.  We expect that figure to decrease to 2.5% in 2019, and to reach 2.4% in 2020 and beyond.  The second impact is that the period over which we will be repaying the debts has been pushed out.<\/p> <p>  In regard to any impact on floating rates within the Central Bank or any other non-traditional sources of revenue, we not expecting any other further change beyond what I have indicated already.<\/p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Broughan's fourth question about the impact of contract manufacturing on our national income, I add the very big caveat that while it is impacting the top-line figures that we are aware of - I said a moment ago that it could be between 1.5 and 2 points - it is not affecting the things I use to determine how much tax revenue we are likely to gain, or what the right tax policy is.  That is why, for example, I do not say we should have increased Government expenditure last year by 7% or 8%.  That is not how our real economy grew.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#H01000","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  We received a very good presentation from our excellent budget advisory office team on the issue of rainy day funds.  I cannot recall the exact details, but if I remember our discussions rightly, the key issue affecting the application was whether European rules would allow us to use funds we set aside in subsequent budgets in a proper counter-cyclical manner to give the Minister extra fiscal leeway.  The officials seemed to advise that if there was not certainty around that, they did not see the benefit of a rainy day fund.  I think that if the Government can get such certainty, a rainy day fund makes sense.  Particularly in circumstances where our economy is going full throttle, previous experience suggests that we need to become counter-cyclical rather than cyclical as best we can.  That is one of the lessons it is to be hoped we will learn from our economic past.  Has there been any clarity from European authorities about how the application of the fund would apply in future budgets, when we came to spend it in that counter-cyclical way?<\/p> <p>  I have a second, very broad question.  This is a very general question in a sense.  There is a historic analysis of the past 20 or 30 years in the Western world, and maybe in other parts of the world too, which posits that there has been a shift towards capital, away from payment to labour and wages.<\/p><p>The power of capital has increased because of globalisation; capital can move very fast and a variety of different issues arise.  The relative share of national income going to wages has fallen in a way that is detrimental in a whole range of ways.  I mean in terms of providing for the needs of our people but there are also political and other knock-on effects, which we do not want.  Does the Minister have a strategic sense in that regard that we, as a country, want to increase pay levels?  I know that he cannot say so in light of pay negotiations.  Let us consider the private sector as well.  Is there an objective that goes against the trend, which has been in place for so long?  One of the ways we could achieve the objective, where we would not economically damage the country, is if we had sufficient productivity growth to allow such pay.  Productivity is often forgotten about in our economic statistics.  Can the Minister outline, if not now then later, what productivity statistics are used?  Where is the analysis on productivity returns?  Where are the productivity accounts?  I attended a meeting this morning and heard a figure for Northern Ireland's productivity, which showed a deeply worrying decline in productivity in the past year and is a sign of the political failure in that jurisdiction.  Where are our productivity statistics?  Where can I find out what is happening to Irish productivity?     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#H01100","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>First, we do believe that we are going to get agreement from the European institutions to spend the rainy day fund in a counter-cyclical way.  We are engaging with the Commission on that matter at the moment.  It is doing some work across the EU in terms of developing these funds.  Even within the current legal framework there is recognition of an exceptional circumstances clause.  If we consider how that clause could be triggered, let alone how the policy in this area will evolve across the coming years, we believe we will be able to get agreement to use this fund in a counter-cyclical way.<\/p> <p>  Second, I would evaluate the labour share of income on the basis of the GNI*, as opposed to gross domestic product, GDP, or gross national product, GNP.  As I have said on a number of occasions, I believe that GNI* is a more appropriate way to look at our income.  If I consider it on that basis then the labour share of GNI* has not fallen as much as elsewhere.  It would be my intention, across coming years, to see the labour share of the gross national income stabilise and then grow again.  GNI* has been at the heart of many of the recent political difficulties that are being grappled with elsewhere at the moment.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of how we do such work, I shall outline the two most obvious ways.  First, we need to get more people working for longer and get more people back at work.  Second, as the Deputy has said, we need to grow productivity.  I am pleased to tell him that only a few weeks ago my Department and the OECD published a paper on how we measure productivity in Ireland at a micro level.  We looked at what we think the productivity frontier is in Ireland and how that stacks up on the basis of firm size.  We have all of those figures.  He will see some trends that are positive and other things that must be addressed, particularly the gap between the growth in productivity in some companies versus smaller companies in different sectors.  I shall forward the paper to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#J00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I wish to comment on the first option to get everyone working and working all of the time.

From what the Minister has said the policy seems to be to keep the ship steady and everything will be all right.  I did not get that sense from reading the risk assessments.  He has identified three risks as highly likely to happen in housing; changes in corporate tax risks; and EU climate change and renewable energy targets.<\/p> <p>  I find it slightly disturbing that the Minister must come back to us on the last matter.  To my mind, that is the typical approach adopted by the Government.  I mean the risk is galloping towards us but the Government has not taken it seriously, including its impact.  The matter has been identified as high risk but the Government has decided not to do a lot about it.   <\/p> <p>  On the issue of corporate tax risks, there is a contradiction.  I was slightly heartened to hear about an increase in wage share.  On several occasions I have mentioned the wage gap and the reduction in wage share as against money going to profits and so on.  The drop in wage share is a historical trend across the world since the 1980s.  Sadly, Ireland is the worst because the wage share has dropped more dramatically here than everywhere else.  The drop in wage share does not surprise me given the policies that we have pursued.  We have been particularly enthusiastic supporters of a neoliberal policy of low taxes, particularly on the corporate sector and on wealth.  The wage situation feeds into the housing difficulty because people cannot afford to buy houses.  Even if we build houses people cannot afford to buy them.  We resolved that contradiction the last time by allowing people to borrow crazy amounts of money even though their wages would not allow them to pay for the stuff that they were buying.  Now, we or the banks are reluctant to do so.  As a result we are caught in a bind where housing is a problem.<\/p> <p>  Let us remember that Minister has identified housing as a high risk.  Housing could become a major problem in terms of our capacity to grow given that the economy is moving towards full capacity.  How are people going to pay for the stuff?  The solution is to address the wage share and break from the policy of low corporate taxes and low taxes on wealth.  The Government is not interested in doing so.  The Minister has identified housing as a high risk yet the Taoiseach travelled to Washington and commended Donald Trump on joining the race to the bottom on that issue.  Incredibly, the Taoiseach boasted in Washington that Trump is copying us.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#J01800","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#J01900","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Aside from the madness of that politically, does the Minister not see the contradiction economically?<\/p><p>Unless we address the distribution of wealth, which can only be addressed by breaking from the policy of low taxation on corporations and wealth, in the hope of spurring-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018041800002#J02000","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524060000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>We agreed to keep questions concise to give all members time to ask questions.

State-funded research estimates that 85,000 of today's children on the island of Ireland will die prematurely due to overweight and obesity.  Sadly, we are seeing evidence that something catastrophic is already happening; children as young as eight years old are presenting with high blood pressure and young people are presenting with heart disease, which used to only be seen in middle age.  In disadvantaged areas we are also witnessing a new phenomenon of children who are simultaneously obese and malnourished.  Consequently, our timeframe for action is rapidly receding.<\/p> <p>  There have been welcome recent developments such as the impending sugary drinks tax but we must do much more to turn the tide.  This is a hugely complex area and we cannot hope to raise all of our issues and proposed actions in the time allotted today.  This statement will address the marketing of unhealthy food and drinks to children, which the evidence shows is a key driver of our obesity crisis.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Heart Foundation is an international leader in this area.  In 2016 we published Europe's first ever research on the tactics used by junk food marketers to target children online.  This research was endorsed by the World Health Organization, whose follow-up study has been influential at European Union Commission level.  Along with our Stop Targeting Kids campaign our research has impacted as far away as Canada where a Bill to ban unhealthy food marketing to children is now before its Parliament.<\/p> <p>  If a small consultancy company that virtually nobody has heard of potentially influenced the course of a US presidential election using data harvested via Facebook, imagine the extent to which junk food marketers can use digital platforms to manipulate children.  Cambridge Analytica attempted to persuade adult voters to exercise their franchise in a particular way over a short timeframe.  Junk food marketing involves the world's best marketing brains in the biggest agencies relentlessly targeting children, who we know are way more susceptible to advertising, every single day.<\/p> <p>  When we published our groundbreaking research we had not heard of Cambridge Analytica or pyschographic micro-targeting.  Junk food marketers have been doing this for years to bombard children with clever marketing messages that distort their food choices.  It is important to state that the causal link between unhealthy food marketing and childhood obesity has been proved conclusively.  This is why restrictions on broadcast advertising were introduced in Ireland five years ago.  This did not, however, prompt a more responsible approach from marketers, just an explosion in unregulated digital marketing that is more personalised and effective, and therefore potentially more damaging.  As a result, junk food brands have achieved a wholly inappropriate proximity to children, pestering them relentlessly in school, at home and even in their bedrooms through their smart phones.  It is called \"brand in the hand\" and it gives marketers constant access to children.<\/p> <p>  Marketers have huge amounts of individuals' information, extracted from children through digital platforms such as Facebook: who they are, where they live, where they go, who their friends are, their hobbies, their heroes, favourite foods etc.  The marketers use this information to connect with children on a one-to-one basis, employing to so-called three \"Es\", which are powerful engagement, emotional and entertainment-based tactics.  There is strong emphasis on fun and humour and on using sports stars, celebrities, festivals, special days and competitions.  The effect is that children associate positive emotions and excitement with junk brands and they often do not realise they are being advertised at.  Brands get on to the young people's newsfeeds and interact like real friends, effectively becoming part of children's social lives.  The brands even get children to become marketers for them by tagging friends in to advertisements and by posting messages.  All of this happens behind parents' backs on social media and much of the pester power they are subjected to is generated by junk brands pestering children.<\/p> <p>  The argument is often put that people can ignore advertising, but from tobacco marketing in the past to junk marketing and the targeting of voters, which is now under the spotlight, there is a longstanding pattern of people being persuaded to act against their own interests.  This is not the exercise of free choice; it is manipulation that usurps free choice.  I reiterate that children are far more susceptible.<\/p> <p>  The foods most commonly marketed to children are sugary breakfast cereals, soft drinks, sweet or savoury snacks and fast foods that are advertised as everyday products when in a healthy diet they should be consumed rarely and in small quantities.  This has turned the food pyramid on its head and has distorted the public perception of what a normal diet is.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, the State's response has been feeble, putting its faith in a voluntary code in an industry whose major players have consistently shown they will do as little as they can get away with.  In fairness, their remit is not the protection of public health; it is to maximise shareholder wealth and in the hard-bitten boardrooms of the multinational processed food industry this is what executives are judged on.  These companies, therefore, have no role in the solution.  The damaging impact of overselling their products has created a market failure that the State must resolve.<\/p><p>From banking to gambling and from tobacco to environmental protection, across the planet voluntary codes do not work.  A voluntary industry advertising industry code was in place throughout the online explosion of unhealthy food marketing to children here.  Companies adopting the code are not obliged to abide by their commitments while firms acting responsibly are put at a competitive disadvantage that can only be remedied by the level legal playing field of regulation.<\/p><p> Junk food marketing is fuelling obesity, obesity is damaging children and the State is failing to protect children's health.  The only remedy is an outright ban on unhealthy food marketing to under-16s.<\/p><p> In this country, we are used to looking back at failures of previous generations in meeting their duty of care to children.  In 30 years' time we will all be in the dock, health charities as well as policy makers.  How we act now to minimise the toll of preventable chronic disease and premature death facing so many of our children will determine the judgment passed upon us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Macey.

We are all aware of the health difficulties that obesity can bring but equally, there are all the emotional and behavioural problems in families, as well as the relationship difficulties that are caused.<br\/><br\/>Presenting with me here today I am delighted to be joined by my colleague, Dr. Adele Keating, who is a psychologist in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and who works with Parents Plus.  One of the strengths of the Parents Plus approach is that we have tried to collaborate with other agencies, such as the HSE, the hospitals and Tusla, to deliver parenting programmes to families.<br\/><br\/>As the committee has just heard an eloquent submission from the Irish Heart Foundation about the challenges of marketing to families, I will not spend too much time providing details on those issues.  Certainly, the families Parents Plus is working with are bombarded with an obesogenic environment, in which it is very much harder to bring up children and to maintain a healthy lifestyle than ever before, to the extent that the editor of the <i>The Lancet <\/i>journal has stated that being obese is a normal response to an abnormal environment.<br\/><br\/>We want to focus on the whole issue about the potential solutions and on the aspect of supporting families.  Families are the basic unit that are being bombarded and are under terrible pressure in a very unhealthy environment.  The key to the main solution is to try to support them to manage that.  The previous speaker spoke about the pester power families face.  Families and parents know a lot about what the children should be eating and about healthy lifestyles but find it very hard to put that into practice.  If parents try to buy petrol, they are immediately bombarded with chocolates, drinks and three-for-one offers and they come back out with a whole host of unhealthy foods they are pestered to take with them.<br\/><br\/>The approach in which we are interested is the basic and most promising approach to our families, which is to support families in accessible small groups in communities to take action against this themselves.  It is to empower them with the knowledge that they are not at fault, that they must make choices and must really push back against the environment they are in to change the direction for their families.<br\/><br\/>The way Parents Plus do this is that we have worked with <i>safe<\/i>food, as well as with the charity Supporting Parents and Early Childhood Supports, SPECS, in Bray, to deliver good educational information to families in workshops and in small groups.  They are delivered through services like family resource services and primary care where one supports parents by setting up good routines around eating and good rules regarding food and sleep in order that they can build a healthy family unit.  These are the key aspects of the programme.<br\/><br\/>In the future, the key message - referred to in our detailed submission that I hope all members have had the opportunity to see - is that an important part of a solution to the obesity crisis, in line with health-based and school-based programmes and environmental changes as to how food is marketed and retailed, is the development of small-group healthy family programmes that are educationally delivered in schools, primary care services and family resource services in which parents are brought together and families are supported to develop healthy eating routines, to make good rules in respect of food, exercise etc. but also are given key lead strategies for dealing with the associated behavioural issues.  All the evidence shows that parents know what they should eat and the exercise they should take but the challenge is how to devise an approach.  What does one do with a child throwing a tantrum when all of his friends are being bombarded to go to McDonalds?  How can the parent help him to make a better choice in such instances?<br\/><br\/>A key thing in delivering these programmes is they have to accessible and in the communities.  As specialist services do not reach half of the families that are struggling with this, it is about getting them out to local communities, helping parents to make the programmes themselves and to be involved in their delivery.  This is something that Parents Plus, through the network of the services we work with, are very interested in developing and partnering with agencies like Tusla and the HSE to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Sharry"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Sharry.

The research has shown that the most promising approach if one really wants to intervene, and this is shown internationally, is to deliver an educational, supported programme to parents that is delivered in the community.  This would bring together eight to ten families who all attend a school and would be advertised very positively about being a healthy positive family.  The families and parents would come together over six to eight weeks.  They would be given ideas on nutrition, healthy lifestyles, but also the important things regarding how to implement these things, how to handle behaviour, how to set up good routines and things like that, as well as how they can motivate themselves and their children to change positively.  A key part of that is to break the whole blame and stigma in this because, usually when people are overweight, they are blamed for that, that somehow they have made poor choices.  One cannot even raise the issue with a child or a parent in that situation because the stigma is so strong when actually they should be told, it is not their fault, it is the environment in which the person has been brought up.  Effectively the person has been abused by their environment, literally.  We want to empower people not to feel bad but to make positive empowering choices by bringing them together in groups and helping them do that.<\/p> <p>  For example, parents could campaign to not have junk food advertised to their children.  They could campaign not to have the tuck shop selling unhealthy foods or for parties not to offer fizzy drinks.  One of the most successful initiatives was the healthy lunches projects in schools.  Its success is evidenced by the fact we are not doing it anymore.  We bring parents and groups together to make those very empowering choices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Sharry"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>Does either organisation, in terms of trying to inform people to make healthier choices, give them examples of a better shop?

What are the delegates' thoughts on shelf planning?<\/p> <p>  The delegates mentioned the stigma associated with being overweight,  Will they share some of their experiences in that regard and eating disorders?  Is there a difference in psychology or the approach to a situation where there is obesity and an eating disorder?  Are there parallels from which we can learn because from my experience eating disorders need to be discussed more.  Perhaps they have been discussed more than obesity which we are now starting to try to address.  <\/p> <p>  On the initiatives to discourage fizzy drinks being provided at parties, prohibition does not work.  It is the 80:20 rule.  It is fine to do it for school lunches and in normal day-to-day activity, but there has to be a balance at parties or on special occasions because prohibition does not work, particularly with children.  I hate to hark back to my childhood, but having a fizzy drink was a treat and was treated as such.  I do not think prohibition would work.  <\/p> <p>  Will the delegates address some of these issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#F00700","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524040200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked a number of questions.  There is huge stigma attached to obesity and professionals find it very difficult to address it with families.  I work in an endocrinology department where we see patients with clinical obesity.  We have children who are at the very extreme end of things and what we find is that there are very few community services that intervene with such families because of the stigma attached to addressing obesity with families at a primary care level.  There is a real difficulty when it comes to where we refer on in the provision of of community resources and services.  The problem is probably twofold wherein professionals do not believe they have the skills to address it and it is also stigmatising to address it with families.  One of the big issues is accessibility in order that families can receive support.<\/p> <p>  On eating disorders and obesity, there is a qualitative difference in the psychological underpinnings and the treatments used for both groups.  Sometimes eating disorders can be taken more seriously by services because the risk is seen as more immediate, whereas with obesity the risks are longer term and perhaps not as immediately evident.  They are not offered the level of support somebody who presents with anorexia nervosa or bulimia.   <\/p> <p>  On prohibition, I completely agree.  We always advocate, when working with this population, that everything be in moderation.  It is about looking at treats as treats and how we support families to do this when they are under severe pressure to provide treats constantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Adele Keating"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524040200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Eating disorders are a serious problem but so also is obesity, although it is not approached with the same seriousness.

There have been many studies on the extent of no-fry zones.  Some 70% of our schools have at least one and 30% have at least five fast food outlets within a kilometre of the school gates.  A study showed that Ireland was second to the United States out of 26 developed countries in terms of the rate of increase of fast food outlets.  We have a big problem.  We cannot close down existing fast food outlets so there may be an element of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted but we must start somewhere and deal with this issue.  Professor Sharry discussed the obesogenic environment and there is nothing more obesogenic than fast food outlets deliberately siting themselves near schools to maximise or boost sales.  In terms of the impact of no-fry zones, studies in London have shown that they work.  We can forward them to Deputy Rabbitte.<\/p> <p>  We have addressed marketing as a key driver of obesity.  Children constantly encounter advertising and people trying to get them to buy things that are not good for them.  That takes many forms.  If one goes back 30 years, shops often did not open on Sundays and closed early.  Shops now open all day long and are in communities.  Junk food, fast food and unhealthy food is available wherever one turns.<\/p> <p>  I disagree with Professor Sharry in terms of there being evidence of the growing disparity between the cost of healthy and unhealthy food.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland did a study some years ago which showed that a healthy calorie may be ten times more expensive than an unhealthy one.  All the research and development in global food manufacturing is to the end of packing more calories into unhealthy food and making food more sugary and salty.  Nobody is looking at how to make broccoli more attractive to schoolchildren or how to make fish or lean meat more accessible.  All the effort is being put into packing in calories.  That is where the money and marketers are and that is what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524040200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>On the banning of vending machines, the reduction in calorie intake may appear insignificant but it is clinically significant if sustained over time.  We are discussing vending machines in the broader context of the whole school environment.  We deal with schools across the country in terms of their food provision and we know that what children learn on the curriculum is absolutely fine but the issues arise when they walk out of the classroom.  There is a disconnect between what children learn and what they experience within the school setting and outside the school gates, as we have discussed in terms of no-fry zones.  There is a huge opportunity to improve the school setting.  We have carried out research on the nature of food provision in schools.  There is currently a lack of guidance and support for schools in terms of what should be provided.  We welcome the recent publication by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection of nutrition standards for school meals but we believe that should be extended to all schools and all types of food provision.  It addresses one small element of a far broader issue.  Our research shows that there is significant production of hot snacks such as panini, sausage rolls, pizza slices, chips and so on in schools.  Chicken fillet rolls are very prevalent.  Healthy options may be available but the vast majority of food available in schools are items such as chicken fillet rolls, pizza slices, etc.  Unfortunately, the funding available to schools does not cover the purchase of equipment that might facilitate the school providing more home cooked and nutritious foods.<\/p> <p>  Engagement in PE has been dropping for a long time, particularly by teenage girls, for several reasons, one of which is the traditionally competitive nature of PE and that it has focused on team-based sports and competitive activities which are not typically attractive to girls of that age.

On schools and funding in schools, what liaison have they with the Department of Education and Skills because the schools in my area have no canteen facilities?

We are educating these children about nutrition and it is a do-not-say-as-you-do attitude where we allow them out then to fill up on vending machines.  Is there any policy of schools providing alternative healthy vending machines?  Will we try to make this available to schools to do with a grant option?

If a child has a choice between an apple and a Mars bar, the child will always take the Mars bar.  There was a proposal at one stage to have a 60:40 ratio of healthy and other vending.  That is a recipe for making it look like healthy vending does not work because the Mars bar would be eaten and the apple would be left.  When one takes the Mars bar away the apple will be eaten.<\/p> <p>  There is a company in Ennis called the School Food Company that is going into schools fired with some great thinking around nutrition for children.  It is a private organisation but it is doing great work.  First, they state all the junk has to leave the school because they cannot compete with it with healthy food.  Second, schools need to have a canteen.  It is exactly as Deputy Mitchell stated that there needs to be a place for children to sit down, have a proper meal and eat in some form of comfort.  They put in a kitchen and they make sure that there is space for children to sit and eat the food.  This company, the last I heard, had moved beyond Ennis and had 20 or 25 schools around the country.  It is a tremendous initiative and it appears to be working well.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the voluntary code, I stated in my statement that voluntary codes have been shown around the world not to work because it is not in the interests of the companies to implement them.  By their nature, they have to do as little as they can get away with.  The multinational processed food sector is in the business of making money.  That is what their executives are paid for.

There is plenty of evidence that children as young as nine sign up to Facebook giving false ages.  The effort put into preventing that could be better.<\/p> <p>  There are several weaknesses in the broadcasting legislation that need to be addressed.  Deputy Rabbitte mentioned TV advertising and we know that, despite the regulation, children on average see in excess of 1,000 TV advertisements every year.  The limitations are that it works only up to 6 p.m. when 50% of the audience is made up of under 18s.  Advertisers can advertise as they wish for big sporting occasions such as the recent rugby matches or Gaelic football matches.  Most of the international soccer games are later and the legislation does not apply to them.  Children watch many of them.<\/p> <p>  Children do not watch children's TV.  They watch soap operas such as \"Fair City\" and \"Dancing with the Stars\", which are completely outside the realms of the legislation.  There has been talk about advertising around \"The Big Big Movie\" that is sponsored by large unhealthy food and drink companies.  Brands that sell primarily unhealthy foods can evade the ban by advertising healthier items.  For example, if McDonald's has a Happy Meal with carrot sticks, it can advertise the carrot sticks but the message about the Happy Meal might get through.  We would like that to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  There are reams of evidence to show that children are more susceptible to the personalised, targeted digital form of advertising.  We know that 15 year olds are online for up to five hours a day on average.  Very few parents know what they are doing.  I have a 13 year old boy and I have no idea what he is doing online.  If I try to find out, and I have tried, it does not work.  Parental responsibility is crucial, but it is very difficult for parents to get a sense of what people are doing online.  For our research parents were interviewed about unhealthy food marketing on digital media.  At the start they were fairly relaxed and did not think it was a big deal, but when the tactics were explained to them, particularly the use of sports stars who are promoting products they would never use themselves because of their fitness requirements, they start to get angry.  They were especially angry about the tagging in of friends, getting children to advertise unhealthy food to their friends.  It is very clever and well thought through, and we need to address it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Macey"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Where I live in Lucan there is a boys' secondary school and at lunchtime the boys go directly to the supermarket to get their lunch.

On fitting in healthy weaning practices, there was shocking research from the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital about what was going into children's bottles.  Food processors were being used to break down takeaways to put into bottles.  A huge amount of work needs to be done on weaning practices and getting those healthy habits in from the outset so that it is embedded across the whole family and the whole family is eating as a unit consistently, with the parents acting as role models and eating what they want their children to eat.

We have to come up with a report with recommendations.  I feel like we are going in circles with this discussion with all of the groups that are stakeholders.

I am part of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  We recently did a report on obesity.  We travelled to Holland.  Normally, we would not, but I suggested that there is no point in Britain and Ireland talking to each other about this because we clearly do not have a clue about what we are doing, with the greatest respect to those making efforts.  After that, I know that it will take much patience and hard work because we will not see results from this overnight.

The centre has been in existence since 1991 and is based at University College Dublin.  We have a track record of providing surveillance and scientific data for colleagues in the research community and policymakers.  I wish to highlight, in particular, the childhood obesity surveillance initiative that has been in place since 2008.  It is a World Health Organization international initiative in which Ireland has been participating for the past ten years.  In recent years we have collected data in sentinel primary schools for seven year olds in first class.  We published data in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2015 and will be undertaking further research in 2018.  In the last round the prevalence of overweight and obesity among first class children was 16.9% overall.  That represents a stabilisation over time.  The prevalence is significantly higher among girls than boys and this has been the case in the rounds of data we have collected.  Overweight and obesity are more marked in disadvantaged schools, as designated by the Department of Education and Skills, than in other schools.  That is an important inequality we are keen to emphasise.  Clear targets have been set by the Government in A Healthy Weight for Ireland - Obesity Policy and Action Plan which was published in 2016.  The targets aim at a reduction of 10% in the gap in obesity levels between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups.  That is an important feature of the action.  We had the privilege to listen to some of the discussion earlier.  Obesity is a multi-sectoral problem.  It is a major challenge and something we need to address.  However, there is evidence of stabilisation.  That is important information on which to capitalise and act.  <br\/><br\/>I draw the attention of committee members to a study published in <i>The Lancet<\/i>medical journal in 2017.  The study pooled data over a 40 year period for children and adults.  It shows that there has been a global increase in overweight and obesity in all age groups.  We are focusing, in particular, on children, but I wish to highlight that the increase has also been happening among adults.  There is some evidence of stabilisation in north-western Europe, in particular.  That is important to highlight because it means that we need to capitalise and move on the things that are important to make changes.<\/p><p> If the committee wishes to hear about it, we can cover some more of the work we have been doing in the NNSC on the school meals programme and healthy vending machines.  I draw the committee's attention to the Health Research Board's centre for diet and health research in which all colleagues present have been participating.  As part of that work we have been looking at different age groups and contexts.  We have been following cohorts of individuals to see what patterns of growth and development have been occurring.  In particular, my work has focused on the lifeways cross-generation cohort study of 1,000 families which covers three generations, including children, parents and grandparents.  We see very strong family patterns, clustering, particularly on the maternal line.  These are due to factors such as shared environment in the home, of course, but also the intrauterine environment.  In school programmes I would focus, in particular, on the children in transition year in order to prepare them for pregnancy and later family development.  That will be crucial.  Internationally there is an increasing focus on trying to intervene as early as possible in the life course for women in order to prepare them for pregnancy and the best possible outcomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Cecily Kelleher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I have been deeply fascinated by this topic for a long time.

Before reading the points we submitted to the committee, I would like to set the scene a little, as I am sure the previous group did and Professor Kelleher has just done.  I am quoting largely from a Government publication, A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan.  It states obesity is a largely preventable disorder.  It states only 40% of Irish people are a healthy weight.  It states 25% of schoolchildren are overweight or obese, albeit there mayb e a little stabilisation.  That means that between 80,000 and 100,000 children at school are overweight or obese.  The risk is 7% higher among socially disadvantaged children.  That is really important when it comes to aiming treatment for these children.  The problem is that there may be an attitude that many of these children will become obese adults which they will and that then they will run into trouble.  It is important to realise we do not need to wait until then.  The children are in trouble now.  As Senator Joan Freeman said, 40% of children are having huge psychosocial difficulties.  They have fatty liver disease.  They have an average age of ten years.  They have high cholesterol.  They have high triglycerides.  They have high insulin levels, which means that they will - not may - develop type 2 diabetes.  They are hypertensive.  These are all issues that we traditionally associate with unhealthy adulthood.  These children - 80,000 of them - have them now.  They may not make it to adulthood unless we do something about it.  It is critical.  We are seeing it all the time.  Our waiting list is uncontrollable such is the need for some treatment for these children and their families.<\/p> <p>  We can all quote figures and it all sounds terrible and very dramatic.  I will tell the committee about three particular cases - obviously I will not reveal names - of children whom our team and I have come across recently.  The first relates to a boy who came into my clinic at the age of four years.  When he arrived, I thought he had walked into the wrong clinic because I thought he did not look overweight.  By the time children look overweight they are far too overweight and most of the children who come to my clinic are in that category.  He had been weighed and measured, as they all always are.  We plotted his weight and height on a centile chart to see how he compared with other children of his age.  He was not, in fact, overweight; he was in the high centiles but not overweight.  I started to explain to his mother that, unfortunately, he was in the wrong clinic and that he was probably meant to attend a general paediatric clinic but that we would try to help her out.  At that point she took out her phone and said he was overweight.  She showed me photos of him going back for the previous two years since he was just over two years old where he was, undoubtedly, very overweight.  I asked her what had happened and what she had done.  She told me that she had met the public health nurse who told her what to do and she had done it.  I asked her what she had done.  She said that when they went to the park, the other kids and moms might have crisps, biscuits or little cartons of Ribena and so on, but he could not do that because he had a predisposition to being overweight.  Luckily for her, she had come across a well trained and well motivated public health nurse who had given her advice when she needed it and she had taken it.  She just did not know because it was what lots of mothers were doing, but she had changed what she was doing.  She brings grapes to the park and only gives him water.  He was saved by the public health nurse because he was lucky.  It would be great if we could do that a little more.<\/p> <p>  The next child was aged nine years when I came across her.  She had been attending different services in the hospital for a couple of years.  She weighed 89.5 kg, which is more than what most men in the room weigh.  She was in a terrible situation in that her mother also had psychiatric comorbidity.  I became involved because people thought it was a child protection issue.  The child was putting on weight because her mother was not doing what she should have been doing.  Her mother was feeding her when she should not have been doing so, not allowing her to exercise, etc.  As I was not comfortable with the child protection thing, we admitted this little girl to Temple Street Hospital at a huge cost for two weeks.  During the two weeks she received 800 calories a day.  She was exercised five times a day by physiotherapists and care assistants, taking walks and spending time in the physiotherapy gym.  During the two-week period she lost 1.5 kg, which was so little that essentially it was not going to make any difference to her health.  That was because we had missed the boat.  This type of treatment will not work for a little girl who has reached that stage.<\/p> <p>  The other case is even worse.  It involves a boy from Cavan who comes to see us.  He is 13 years old and in first year in secondary school.  He weighs 152 kg which is almost 24 stone.  He has a really unhealthy lifestyle.  He plays the Xbox a lot.  He eats takeaways more than one would regard as healthy.  He drinks fizzy drinks.  His only social interaction is with his friends on the Xbox.  I have no idea how it works and how they do it on Xbox.  He is socially isolated otherwise because he weighs 152 kg.  He says to me - we know that it is true - that all of his friends also do it, but they do not weight 152 kg.  He has hyperinsulinism, a fatty liver and high blood pressure.  He will not make it to adulthood unless he has bariatric surgery, which is the only treatment option for a boy such as this.  However, he cannot because we do not have bariatric surgery available for him and will not have for another seven years.  I do not know if he will make another seven years.  That puts it in context and lets members understand the misery these children are suffering.<\/p> <p>  I will outline what we propose to do about it.  We certainly need treatment options for the children concerned.  There are two types.  There is the behavioural model of treatment for children who suffer with mild or even moderate obesity such as the first little boy who will respond to such treatment.<\/p><p>We need the bariatric service.  We need the whole service - the surgery and the psychological support before and afterwards for the other children, the 80,000 children who are in that situation.  Nothing else will help.  We are very pleased that there has been engagement with the new children's hospital, which understands this issue.  The service planners are saying that there will be a bariatric service in the new children's hospital and we are delighted about this and very much welcome it.<\/p><p> They are the two different types of treatments we need.  It is not only health.  Like the previous speaker said, we need a whole systems approach to this.  We need education.  I am very involved at an educational level and we would try to educate our undergraduates across the health disciplines but we need education before that.  We need it in schools.  We need it everywhere.  We need environmental planning so that these children can get out and exercise.  Possibly, above all, we need regulation of the food industry and advertising around this.  This is critical.  Unless all of this happens, we will not tackle it successfully.<\/p><p> The other major issue is prevention.  All of the speakers alluded to this.  We need prevention and we need it early.  It has been shown in the US that intervention at preschool level is too late.  We need intervention the generation before.  Some of that is beginning in terms of health promotion.  We need to educate transition year students, not for they themselves, although they will pick up something, but for the next generation.  That is where we need to go.  It is definitely about pre-pregnancy.  There needs to be a lot of investment in the prevention of obesity.<\/p><p> We welcome the initiatives that exist in terms of health promotion.  The HSE has a healthy eating and active lifestyle programme.  The island demonstration programme links to transition year.  These are very welcome initiatives but they are only a start.  Some of the previous speakers alluded to a national packed lunch policy for primary schools.  That does not cost anything and would be very helpful.  We half do it but it would be very easy to do a full-on version for everybody.  We certainly welcome the sugar tax legislation and look forward to its implementation.  We can see changes so there has been reformulation because, like a previous speaker said, the food industry is about making money.  If they reformulate drinks so they can still make money, that is great.  The kids are still buying the stuff but at least it has less sugar, so there have been changes.  We would love to see the money that is made from the sugar tax legislation being reinvested into the treatment of childhood obesity.  It seems obvious to us that this is what needs to happen.  There needs to be investment that is significant and sustainable at Government level in the treatment of childhood obesity because the appointment of a national clinical lead on obesity and the setting up of a clinical advisory group - the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland policy group - cannot do anything unless we have investment behind us.  The investment needs to be in both prevention and the two different types of treatment for these children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sinead Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I think Dr. Murphy has answered my question about what happens.

I thank the witnesses for coming before us today and telling the stories because that is what makes it feel real.  I have lived it myself so I know what this is about.  It is not just about having bad parents.  I had great parents.  Sometimes it gets to a point where it is a case of this being an issue.  As I mentioned in the previous session, we do not want to give them a complex.  I know the witnesses were probably here for the previous session so I do not want to repeat that.  It is devastating to hear those stories but it is very helpful to get the human side of it, which is so real.<\/p> <p>  The issue of environmental planning is very interesting.  I mentioned the report we did on the Netherlands which has taken a very cross-departmental and local approach.  I would be very willing to share the report with the witnesses.  With many of these reports, I feel that we spend a lot of time producing them and they end up on a shelf and we do not know if anything is ever going to happen.  There is some very interesting stuff in that report about how the Netherlands approaches it at local level.  Its levels have not been as bad as our levels and are reducing.  As I said, it takes a lot of time and that is the frustrating thing about this.<\/p> <p>  Coming at it from a different angle, we hear a lot of talk about fiscal space.  I am not sure I know exactly what economists talk about when they talk about fiscal space but I think there will be an awful lot more fiscal space if we sort this issue out.  It is so short-sighted of us as policymakers not to see that obesity will cause so many expensive health problems in the future.  If it is not obesity, it is cancer.  It is endless.  I do not know about the statistics and the witnesses would be much more qualified to say this than me.  That said, what percentage of people are presenting in hospitals due to alcohol, which contains a huge amount of sugar, or obesity?  The number is huge.  It must take up most of our hospitals' time at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#O00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524040200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Certainly in the adult hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sinead Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>We need to face up to the fact that there is a lifestyle issue here.  We are well down a very unhealthy and catastrophic road where young people will die before their parents.  I have been talking about this until I am blue in the face and I believe that we, as a Government and society, are not doing enough.  Every time I suggest some measure, and I think it is going to have to come from so many different angles, I am hammered by certain people who are libertarians.  They are the very people who will criticise us for tax measures that we must put in place because we need money to take care of the health service and everybody will be sicker and sicker because of this.  This is a rant but I feel so passionately about this.  The pre-pregnancy issue is so crucial because it is a case of monkey see, monkey do.  At the end of the day, we cannot expect children not to drink, smoke or eat a lot of sugar if their parents do.  We need to educate ourselves first and foremost.  I do not know how we as policymakers can do this.  I am trying to be constructive in a sense without being too negative.  The witnesses have given us a long list of things we need to do.  How are we going to get all this done?  Is enough of a system in place?  The witnesses mentioned funding and, obviously, resources are a huge issue, but how are we going to have the will among policymakers to do this?  Is it something we can do because I am withered at this stage talking about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#O00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524040200,"counter":199,"content":"<p>If I can start to answer that impossible question, behind anything we do we must accumulate the evidence to say it works.  We must look to the strengths of the country, which are our size and our ability to do things.  Sitting around the obesity table, as it were, we will often use the smoking ban as a really good example.  It was vehemently opposed by the industry just as seat belts in cars were opposed by the motor industry, but when the evidence emerged that seat belts work, it was a good thing.  Not smoking in a pub works.  It is a good thing.  Making our children healthier is much more complex but the forces against which we are working are similar.  They are industry forces.<\/p> <p>  Professor Kelleher and I sat on the obesity task force in 2005.  It was dead within a year due to lack of funding.  A Healthy Weight for Ireland is the next iteration of that 11 years later.  If cycles of policy fail, it takes another ten years to come around before we get another chance.  This is our chance for the next ten years to begin to make a difference over a timeframe that in reality, is a 30, 40 or 50 year timeframe.  That is difficult for Governments that are elected every four years.  In respect of the Healthy Ireland framework, backing this framework and making obesity and childhood obesity a central plank to address childhood obesity, we need to address homelessness, social justice, drugs and alcohol.<\/p><p>All these will have to be sucked into that complex solution.  The figure of stabilising childhood obesity disguises continued upwards movement in the less well-off and disadvantaged areas while it slides downwards in the better-off, better educated areas.  We are continuing to separate the population.<\/p><p> The obesity policy and action plan has an implementation group which is multisectoral and multidepartmental.  The key ones involved are the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the Department of Health, along with State agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Donal O'Shea","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>As professionals in this area, are the witnesses satisfied the Healthy Ireland framework has sufficient measures but they just need to be implemented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#P00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524040200,"counter":202,"content":"<p>We certainly need to implement it.  We are all players here.  We can give the committee the evidence.  The policymakers can ensure the legislation follows through as is appropriate.  I agree with everything that has been put on the record so far.  As Dr. Murphy stated, every health professional should be trained to intervene early and efficiently.  That is part of why we are doing this in the UCD college of health and agricultural sciences which I oversee.  Every health professional in that is now engaged in a programme where they will be taught to intervene early and compassionately, as is appropriate.  All along the spectrum, when a child sees the GP or public health nurse, the message needs to be in there.  Some of this does not cost money but is about thinking about things differently.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that there are hard environmental issues which need to be tackled.  We are in a sedentary and obesogenic environment.  Accordingly, it is difficult to make the healthy choices.  The individual can take 10,000 steps a day but it also has to be ensured there is adequate opportunity to take exercise, to walk freely and not get caught up in a congested car-polluted environment.  These are all policy matters which support individuals making healthy choices.  There are key points of intervention.  Years ago, we undertook an evaluation of transition year students and the views of boys and girls around breastfeeding.  The boys were enthusiastic about it.  The girls not so much, the reason being that the girls recognised this was a practical thing that they needed to know how to do and how to engage with it properly.  Every part of the education system, health system and the supporting areas needs to be proofed.  That takes political will.  We can advocate to the policymakers but we are not people who can do that.  Professor O'Shea is correct in that one has to have systematic evidence.  The smoking ban is a good example.  We are a small country which can punch above its weight.  We banned smoking outright in public places.  I can give the committee Cochrane Review type international data which support that it has been highly effective across the globe in reducing exposure to passive smoke and hospital admissions, as well as influencing active smoking.  We can get these things done, but we are all players in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Cecily Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>We spoke previously with the Irish Heart Foundation on a public health (obesity) Bill to implement many of these measures.

Anybody looking in this morning will see the facts are in front of us and this is how we can address it.  This is so refreshing.  We have been asked for treatment options, education, environmental planning, regulations around the environment, prevention and early intervention and ensuring funding around the clinical lead.  The human stories have copper-fastened why we need to deal with this issue.  The fact that 80,000 are in need of some form of clinical intervention or some kind of support is concerning.

For instance, we have regular walks that people take as part of the work programme.  We have introduced a step exercise programme whereby staff periodically get up from their desk and hop up and down on the step for a couple of minutes and then sit down again.

If I may, I will respond to a couple of the points that were made earlier about children and exercise.  We know that less than half of children get the recommended amount of exercise.  From a study that was recently done in our department, we know that less than half of the children who came to our clinic had an outdoor space to play in.  If we are dealing with homelessness and tackling the homelessness issue, there is an option to look at this as well because the children have nowhere to go as they cannot go outside and play safely.  I am not even talking about a back garden.  I am talking about an outside public place to play.<\/p> <p>  For the second couple of cases that I described, we know that the children have established severe obesity and the behavioural model does not work.  What we need is a primary care-led, integrated approach where all healthcare professionals are trained.  Regardless of discipline, it is motivated healthcare professionals who are trained in motivating those families to bring about behavioural change and to manage in the obesogenic environment in which they live.  That is what we need.  We need investment and it must be primary care led and available in communities.  Somebody mentioned children coming into hospitals, but that cannot happen.  That is not a good way to deliver the solution.  It was a public health nurse in the case I outlined but it could just as easily be a dietician.  It may be a very interested GP.  The healthcare profession does not matter.  What is important is that it is a healthcare professional who is properly trained and in the right place so that when the children need the intervention, they can have it.<\/p> <p>  The other point that is really important is the measuring of children because by the time they look overweight, the horse has bolted and it is too late.  Children need to be measured routinely.  Perhaps we are a little bit better at commenting on their longitudinal height, but we tend not to measure weight and that should be part of every interaction with a healthcare professional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sinead Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Do I have one minute left?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#Q01100","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Yes.

Participation, drop-off, education, control and planning are the themes I am taking from this discussion.  Participation refers to physical activity, while drop-off refers to the steep decline in activity in secondary school.  Education and awareness refer not only to children but parents in particular.  By control, I mean State control.  In virtually every contribution she makes, Senator Noone refers to the nanny state.  I am all for the nanny state because without it, we would not have rules on seat belts, cycle helmets, smoking, the sale of alcohol sale to certain age groups and so forth.  I have no doubt people will continue to rail against these measures.  The mere mention of labelling food or alcohol as carcinogenic leads to newspaper articles complaining that such labelling is an example of excessive control, which is nonsense.  We all have a job to do, namely, to make life better for all citizens and if that means curtailing an element of freedom, so bloody what.  That is what we have been elected to do.<\/p> <p>  The evidence provided at our two sessions makes clear that the question is not what should be done with the sugar tax but what we should do next.  Should we address fatty foods, for example?  Professor O'Shea stated we should wait for a certain period to see what has been the effect of the sugar tax.  While I fully agree with him, we should also plan our next step, which means discussing issues such as saturated fats, salts, sugars and other products that are added to foods and marketed.  These types of goods are the first items we see in the vast majority of retail premises.  Only one large retailer places fruit and vegetables at the entrance to its stores.  It is a pleasant experience to see the colours of fruit and vegetables.  However, this practice has started to ebb since the retailer was acquired by another company.  On entering my local store, I used to see the beautiful, bright colours of fresh fruit and vegetables, primarily from North County Dublin, which produces approximately 80% of horticultural produce in the State.  This is starting to change, however, with prepacked goods now placed alongside the fruit and vegetables.  This is a terrible shame.  Perhaps the previous owner exercised an element of corporate responsibility.  <\/p> <p>  We need to start bringing planning and control into this conversation.  If, as Professor O'Shea states, we are planning for 40 or 50 years ahead in terms of impact and we only get to do so every ten years, unless we act now, the knock-on effect of the work of this committee and the Joint Committee on Health could last for two or three decades.  That is a stark message.<\/p> <p>  I read all the submissions before the meeting.  Even as a parent of two small boys, both of whom are relatively healthy, I think about what I place in my shopping basket.  I buy smoothies, which are 100% fruit, but I may need to make some decisions on the issue of treats. <\/p> <p>  I was a councillor for seven years before my election to the D&aacute;il in 2011.  During that time, I was involved in a couple of development plans and local area plans.  The development plans were fairly standard and the local area plans included planning for infrastructure in a certain zone, perhaps a field or whatever.  We heard about porous pedestrian routes.  The local area plans in which I was involved has very few such routes.  I am from an urban environment.  A development zone on the outskirts of town will have walking routes if it is primarily residential.  The norm, however, is for older communities to resist access for new communities.  They may not oppose entry to the community but they do not want others to be able to pass through because they do not want teenagers coming into their area as they perceive it may result in anti-social behaviour.  This presents a serious problem in terms of healthy lifestyles because parents will not allow their children to cycle if they are blocked from accessing a route.  We have to learn from that.  I mean no disrespect to local authority members but we cannot rely on local authorities taking a uniform approach.  This means a national approach is required and this should be done through primary legislation.<\/p> <p>  We have already seen the effect of the sugar tax, even thought it has not yet been implemented.  Senator Noone referred to saturated fats and Professor O'Shea referred to food labelling.  While food labelling is important, perhaps the print on labels must be larger.  We should discuss what effect a 50% increase in the size of the lettering used to identify the sugar content on packaging would have.  Given the positive impact of previous changes in areas such as smoking and drinking alcohol, perhaps we should start making changes in the area of food.  I ask the witnesses to make some general observations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#R00300","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524040200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The Chairman's observations are good and very much in the spirit of the discussion.  I reiterate the point I made about the power of the public sector to make a difference.  The Chairman touched on the issue of planning, which is crucial.  We are about to make a significant investment in primary schools because of demographic changes.  As part of the process, we have the power to proof the planning for these schools and identify, for instance, what types of catering facilities could be provided.  We discussed the difficult issue of children leaving schools to buy items in private supermarkets.  We should ask what power the public sector has to make the changes.  This will be crucial because it is a step we can take.<\/p> <p>  If we take the history of public health, if this committee had been meeting 100 years ago, it would have discussed infant mortality, slums and poor housing, all of which were effectively addressed by planning.  Subsequently, the 1947 Health Act had a major influence on public health nurses and others.  We can do these types of things.  We should examine all the options for their effectiveness because they work.  While I agree that issues around taxing specific products, labelling and working with industry to improve product availability are all important, there are also many means by which we can change patterns of consumption immediately, including altering the environment in workplaces and health settings.  We could and should do these things.  We should proof public policy in these types of areas, carry out urban planning accordingly and ensure we think of these kinds of pieces. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Cecily Kelleher"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524040200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>As pillars, participation, drop-off, education, control and planning are very good and the only others I would add are effectiveness and evidence.<\/p><p>I refer to labelling and the question was asked as to whether the industry would oppose traffic lights.

It also needs to be equitable because, at the moment, an enormous number of children are referred to a hospital service because there is no community dietician.  There needs to be significant investment, not only in public health nurses but in all healthcare professionals in the community.  We would need to gather the evidence but I have no doubt that the evidence would be overwhelmingly in favour of it and that there would not be a great cost relative to the gain.  The current cost of childhood obesity is enormous and will not change unless we do something about it.  It would be a really positive measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018041800002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Sinead Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040200,"counter":248,"content":"<p>Where are we going in terms of childhood obesity, mortality rates and impacts on society if we do not have serious intervention?

I formerly worked as a consultant with the HSE's child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  I am accompanied by Ms Carol McCormack, who is a clinical nurse manager in Willow Grove adolescent inpatient unit.  We welcome the opportunity to respond to the committee's invitation to provide information on the operation of adolescent mental health services at St. Patrick's Mental Health Services, which consists of three approved centres with a total inpatient capacity of 293 adult and 14 adolescent beds.  Community mental health services are provided by a network of Dean Clinics in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  The service works to provide the highest quality of mental health care, promote mentally healthy living, develop mental health awareness, advocate for the rights of people who are experiencing mental health difficulties and enhance evidence-based knowledge.<\/p> <p>  The 14-bed Willow Grove adolescent inpatient unit provides specialist multidisciplinary evidence-based care to young people between the ages of 12 and 17.  It accepts referrals nationally and offers intensive inpatient management for a range of severe mental health difficulties, including mood, anxiety and psychotic disorders, often with associated suicidality and self-harming behaviour.  There are specific eating disorder recovery programmes for anorexia and bulimia.  Young people may have associated neurodevelopmental difficulties, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or autistic spectrum disorder.  Each young person has an individual care plan which is reviewed weekly by the multidisciplinary team and discussed with the young person.  This ensures there is an individualised and person-centred package of care.  Service quality is assessed through annual inspections by the Mental Health Commission and the quality network for inpatient CAMHS.  In September 2017, electronic health records were introduced to the adolescent service.  In the national context, the 2016 annual report of the Mental Health Commission highlighted 68 admissions of children to adult units in 2016.  The shortage of operational beds in dedicated child units was a contributory factor in this regard.  There were 76 registered beds in HSE child units, 66 of which were operational.  The recommendation in A Vision for Change, based on population data from the 2011 census, is that there should be 118 child and adolescent inpatient beds.  Each year, a small number of children are sent by the HSE to the UK for highly specialised inpatient treatment which is currently not available in this country.<\/p> <p>  A part-time adolescent community service in the Dean Clinic in Lucan offers outpatient care to young people between the ages of 12 and 17 who have mild or moderate mental health difficulties.  This services offers assessment and a range of evidence-based therapeutic interventions, including cognitive behavioural therapy, supportive psychotherapy, psychiatric review, pharmacotherapy, family support, dietician advice, occupational therapy and a psychology skills group based on dialectical behavioural therapy concepts.  There is also a subspecialist outpatient service offering assessment of gender identity.  In addition, there is an adolescent Dean Clinic in Cork offering psychiatric input and individual cognitive behavioural therapy.  All referrals are reviewed by a consultant psychiatrist on the day of receipt.  The inclusion and exclusion criteria that are in operation are based on expertise and available resources to ensure our service meets the needs of young people.  Due to the demand for our service, there is usually a waiting list in operation and it can vary in length in accordance with service demand.  The current waiting list for the Dean Clinic in Lucan is three to four months.<\/p> <p>  A new system of nurse-led prompt assessment of need by means of telephone triage was introduced earlier this year to signpost the most appropriate service for adolescents.  We have observed a number of recent trends.  Some GPs are concurrently referring to local HSE CAMHS and St. Patrick's Mental Health Services outpatient services to request a service from the organisation that can offer the most rapid appointment to an adolescent.  As a result of this increased number of referrals, young people who are admitted to paediatric medical beds can remain there for extended periods of time - sometimes weeks - while a suitable inpatient mental health bed is awaited.  When public inpatient units are at capacity, CAMHS outpatient services may refer concurrently to public and independent inpatient units in the absence of private health insurance, with the HSE indicating a willingness to fund admission to St. Patrick's Mental Health Services.  We have noticed an increase in HSE-funded inpatient admissions to Willow Grove, particularly in the last year and a half.<\/p><p>In St. Patrick's, the Changing Minds Changing Lives Strategy 2018-2022 envisages an expansion of the Willow Grove adolescent service to 20 inpatient beds, development of a comprehensive day programme and enhancement of the work of the adolescent Dean Clinics.  We hope this information is helpful and we are happy to answer any questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aileen Murtagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Murtagh.

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  I work as a clinical nurse specialist in the north Cork child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, area.  For anyone who does not know that catchment area, it includes from Charleville at the border with Limerick to Mitchelstown at the border with Tipperary to Millstreet at the border with Kerry to our border with Waterford.I have been working in the field of child and adolescent mental health for the past 34 years.  During that time I have worked 18 years in the United Kingdom, two years in Australia and the past 14 years in Ireland.  During that time I worked within three inpatient adolescent units and in five CAMHS teams in Ireland, England and Australia.  I have been working for the past four years in the north Cork CAMHS area, which has a population of 94,000.  I am the chairperson for the Forum in Ireland for Nurses in Child and Adolescent Mental Health, FINCAMH.  We are a group of specialist nurses who meet a number of times a year to discuss issues of practice, education and development in child and adolescent mental health.  Our mission statement is to promote the knowledge and interests of nurses in child and adolescent mental health services and to increase their profile and self-awareness for the benefit of the nurses and the service users.  As a clinical nurse specialist in CAMHS, I work directly with children, young people and their families.  I am responsible for managing a caseload.  I carry out assessments, provide evidenced-based therapeutic interventions and work as part of a multidisciplinary team.<br\/><br\/>I came today to talk about the strengths of the team and the gaps that I see in the services.  Those are the issues I would like to cover.  Regarding the strengths of the CAMHS team in which I work, we work as a multidisciplinary team, which, for anybody who does not know that term, means we have a range of disciplines available to work with our clients.  We carry out joint assessments.  We provide a range of individual interventions and also group activities such as behavioural management parenting groups, dialectical behaviour therapy, emotional regulation groups, mind and mood groups and adolescent parenting groups.  These groups all run on a regular basis throughout the year.  As part of our work, we liaise and network with other agencies such as the autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, team; the adult mental health service; Tusla, which is our child protection service; national and secondary schools within and outside the region; educational welfare officers; the National Educational Psychological Service; special educational needs co-ordinators; and the regional and national hospitals.<b><\/b><br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will outline some of the challenges we currently face in the CAMHS team in which I work.  As I explained, there is the vastness of the geographical area we cover, given the population size.  A Vision for Change recommends there should be two CAHMS teams to a population of 100,000.  At present we have one incomplete team for a population of 94,000.  Children who present with a possible attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, are most likely placed on a routine waiting list as older adolescents are often presenting as emergencies with deliberate self-harm, eating disorders and psychosis.  As a result of this, children sit on a waiting list which risks their difficulties becoming more entrenched and, therefore, they are not reaching their social, emotional and academic potential.  Medical paediatric consultations are frequently required to clarify the physical health status of some children with mental health disorders.  Lack of resources and waiting lists in those services have a knock-on effect on our diagnosis, intervention and can also impede discharge.  Currently, children who have ADHD and are on medication are unable to be discharged due to a lack of a care pathway that meets their needs appropriately.<b><font color=\"#A2A2A2\"> <\/font><\/b><br\/><br\/>We have an absence of a hospital-based liaison team.  During the 14.5 years I have been in posts in this area, there has been no liaison team.  A Vision for Change recommends one team per catchment area of 300,000.  A liaison team would provide cover to paediatric, general and maternity hospitals.  National recruitment is unhelpful due to a lack of communication between the local level need and the national level recruitment drive.  There is a time lag due to the processing of candidates and a mismatch between candidate's skill and the needs of the team.  There is a lack of transparency for candidates about which team they will be placed in.  Currently, the recruitment process gives neither the team nor the candidate an opportunity to prior information or knowledge.  Currently in the CAMHS team in which I work, we have insufficient physical space for clinical intervention, waiting areas and staff offices.  We have four clinical rooms available to a staff team of 10.5 clinicians.  Rooms have to be booked or we are unable to see the clients.  All staff should have appropriate experience, apart from college placements, prior to commencing in CAMHS, or if staff come in as a basic grade, they need to be under the direction of a senior clinician of their discipline that is based on-site. <br\/><br\/>Opportunities for training and continuous professional development are inequitable between disciplines placed on teams.  Again, these do not always take into account the skills needs of the wider team.  Children with both an ADHD and ASD query tend to sit on both a local CAMHS and an ASD team waiting list, despite both conditions being neurodevelopmental conditions.  There is a high comorbidity between these conditions.  We have no computerised system for collecting data, which prevents us from planning effectively for our client groups.  We have insufficient administration support.  This leads to clinicians using valuable clinical time to perform administrative duties such as sending out letters, reports and appointments.  For the past four years in the north Cork CAMHS area we have had one full-time administrative officer.  We were recently granted another administrative officer in November but on a temporary basis.<br\/><br\/>In terms of possible solutions, there is a need for two complete CAMHS teams to cover the catchment area that could be geographically located to best meet the needs of the client group and make more efficient use of clinician time.  Currently, we are travelling across the region to provide satellite clinics.  Access to the service by children with ADHD needs to maximised through the provision of a specialist neurodevelopmental team, which could consist of a paediatrician, CAMHS and ASD clinicians, as is the case and is working successfully in the UK.  This could incorporate a nurse-led service with an advanced nurse practitioner, which would allow for children with ADHD on medication who have completed all other CAMHS intervention to be discharged to this nurse-led team.  Discharging children is important for both the psychological well-being of both the child and his or her family. This also improves capacity for intake, improves staff morale and job satisfaction.  In the UK, teams have a primary mental health worker, or workers, who is not discipline-specific, but is a senior clinician.  Their role is to offer consultation to general practitioners, schools, on adult mental health, and to Tusla, our child protection service.<\/p><p>They also take on the role of interfacing with all of the agencies that refer to CAMHS to ensure referrals are appropriate and engage in preventive work and consultations with referring agencies.  These clinicians do not carry a caseload.  Preventive and early intervention work is essential to build resilience in young people and parents.  It needs to be done at community level in order that referrals to CAMHS will be reduced in the long term.  This can be addressed by supporting community teams, recognising the importance of infant mental health and psycho-educational groups for the parents of children who have commenced school.  The service we offer should aim to improve the child's or young person's life chances by reducing and preventing comorbid acute mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and self-harm, thereby reducing the risk of family, social and educational breakdown and allowing a child to reach his or her full potential.<\/p><p> There is no national strategic plan for CAMHS.  We need a five to ten year vision for the service.  We also need to use technology in assisting with the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.  The computer based QbTest is used successfully in the United Kingdom and within other CAMHS teams in Ireland and has improved the efficiency of the services.  We do not have access to it within the Cork CAMHS team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sonia Magaharan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Magaharan.

I am not representing the Health Service Executive, HSE, and my address to the committee is without prejudice.  I am a clinical nurse specialist in south Wexford CAMHS.  I have spent the past 25 years working in CAMHS, the first 15 in the north east, serving counties Cavan, Meath, Monaghan and Louth, and the last ten in Wexford.  In that time I have watched CAMHS teams develop throughout the country , from seven nurses nationally in 1993 to approximately 120 working in community CAMHS teams today.  The number of CAMHS teams has grown from zero outside Dublin in 1993 to 69.  When I speak about teams, I mean the teams recommended in A Vision for Change in 2006 - one team per 50,000 head of population, consisting of one child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist and, under the direction of this consultant, one junior medical staff member, two psychologists, two social workers, two clinical nurse specialists, one speech and language therapist, one occupational therapist and one social care worker.  That gives a multidisciplinary team of 11 staff, which also requires one secretary and one administrator.  This skill mix is a must to adequately address the clinical needs of the varied and very complex clinical presentation of the children we are asked to see. <\/p> <p>  There is a population of approximately 80,000 in my area of Wexford south.  We do not meet and have never met the standards in A Vision for Change.  We have one child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist, although we should have two for a population of 80,000; two clinical nurse specialists where we should have three; one psychologist instead of four; one basic grade social worker instead of a principal social worker, plus two basic grade social workers; one occupational therapist and 0.5 of a speech and language therapist where we should have one operating full time; 0.5 of a social care worker where we should have two. <\/p> <p>  We operate on a clinical need basis; urgent referrals are seen as a priority.  Routine referrals are placed on a waiting list to be seen.  Ours is a very hard working and committed creative team, like all CAMHS teams across the country.  We get involved in projects in the community, set up groups to enhance treatments such as parenting groups for ADHD, activity groups and dog walking groups, to mention just a few.  <\/p> <p>  The role of the child and adolescent health team is to assess and treat children at the severe end of the scale such as those with early onset schizophrenia, depression, anorexia nervosa, ADHD and severe anxiety.  During the years many children and families have benefited from our input.<\/p> <p>  As a team, we struggle every day to overcome many obstacles, including being under-resourced; having poor accommodation which is not fit for purpose; having no consultant cover for consultant leave; difficulties in recruitment and the retention of staff and having no ability to facilitate the training of student nurses.  The accommodation at Slaney House is substandard and not fit for purpose.  A review of the building in 2006 pointed to 25 issues that needed to be addressed to bring the building up to standard.  Some of these issues were first addressed in 2015 when it received its first coat of paint in 14 years.  The building was a residential house and it is neither clinical nor child friendly.  Five staff members share one room measuring approximately 6 m by 4 m.  There are no facilities to carry out physical examinations which are necessary to start clients on medication.  Accommodation was to have been secured in 2017.  October 2017 was the move-in date.  We were all very excited at the prospect of having more rooms to provide therapy, engage in group work and the possibility of developing a full child and adolescent mental health service.  There was also the possibility of developing a day programme to support clients who could not be given an urgent hospital bed or clients who were not attending school owing to illness and those in need of a greater therapeutic input.  We were informed by management that the proposed building was to have another tenant, but it could not inform us who.  That was the last we heard about being given suitable accommodation.<\/p> <p>  The second problem I experience as a front-line worker is that of having no consultant cover.  Our consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist is entitled to his leave, like the rest of us, but he is the clinical lead for the team and takes full responsibility for all of the patients who attend the service and their treatment.  When he is on leave, there is no replacement; hence no new referrals are examined and no new clients are seen.  As per An Bord Altrainis and the standard operating procedure, I, as a nurse, cannot see clients without a clinical lead, nor can the junior doctors.  To work safely within my scope of practice, planned reviews must be cancelled during this time.  For seven years I have been bringing this issue to the attention of management at all levels, including sending the reason children needed to be seen to them via email.  Some children have been admitted to Wexford General Hospital for a week or more as a result of there being no consultant cover where they spent their time without any therapeutic input.  However, that problem has changed in the past six months as an out-of-hours adult psychiatrist provides an assessment and treatment for the children admitted in the absence of a proper hospital liaison child and adolescent team as per A Vision for Change in 2006, that is, one team per 300,000 people.<\/p> <p>  My direction from management in the absence of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist is to work within my scope of practice and contact management should a child require a consultant assessment.  It took two weeks the last time I needed this facility for a child who needed an urgent assessment.  It required several requests by me before it was followed up.  As a nurse, it is very frustrating to listen to distressed parents who are seeking help for their sick child when I cannot offer the service I offered the previous week.  We lose the trust and credibility we work so hard to earn by not being able to offer a service.  The parents tell us that there is no consistency in the service.  As research has shown, consistency is the basis of all therapeutic interventions.  This is not to mention the frustration of general practitioners who telephone CAMHS seeking a service during the consultant's absence.  As a nurse on the front line, I should be able to go about my work without having to look for a consultant.  I have received numerous calls from upset parents owing to cancelled appointments.<\/p> <p>  Most of the consultant child and adolescent positions in the country are filled.  There are 69 teams, but, to the best of my knowledge, 35% of the consultants are locums, posts filled by agencies.  As the committee heard from previous speakers at this forum, it is difficult to find child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists owing to the two-tier salary scale.  However, consultants on agency rates receive the same salary as, if not more than, the permanent consultant.  Therefore, it does not make sense to have a two-tier system.<\/p><p>My reason for bringing this to members' attention is that nurses who wish to progress and become acting nurse practitioners or wish to take the nurse prescribing course cannot do so in 35% of CAMHS services as the consultant is required to work with the nurse in taking the said course.  Hence, a failure to provide a permanent child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist is preventing nurses in CAMHS from progressing on their career pathways.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On the recruitment of nurses to CAMHS, in Wexford south CAMHS we cannot take student nurses as there is not enough room in the building.  We cannot offer consistency in that we may not have consultant cover for the period of the student placement.  The knock-on effect of taking no students is no exposure to child psychiatry; hence nobody trains in the access module to child psychiatry.  One nurse took the course two years ago and there has been none since from the south east.  Some of the students who in the past sought placement in CAMHS are now working in London.  They have informed me that they are well remunerated for their work, with accommodation packages and access to training courses such as nurse prescribing and family therapy.  When asked whether they would return to work in Ireland, their answer was a very clear &quot;no&quot;.  They said they had already been treated badly following their qualification when they were given 85% of staff nurse wages.<br\/><br\/>Following discussion with my colleagues from around the country, many are reconsidering the positions they hold in CAMHS.  Some have already left and are going to Canada, Australia and Britain.  Given the deals nurses are being offered elsewhere, it would be hard to refuse, considering that we treat our newly qualified as &quot;yellow packs&quot; by offering them substandard wages.  Even if we were to provide 500 more places in nurse training each year for the next three years, how many would remain in the country?  Given the poor working conditions, poor pay and the fact that they are totally undervalued, there is no incentive to stay.  In 1999 the commission on nursing made provision for nurses like me to stay in a clinical role and not to move into management.  My colleagues and I endeavoured to educate more nurses in CAMHS, but owing to our working conditions, this was not possible.<br\/><br\/>Children seen by GPs are referred to CAMHS in the absence of a properly resourced primary care psychology, autism or disability service.  Wexford autism and disability services have a two-year waiting list, while Wexford primary care psychology services have a two-year waiting list.  These services do not work on clinical need, but CAMHS ends up receiving more referrals as a result.  Our nearest inpatient hospital is over 200 km away in &Eacute;ist Linn in Cork.  It is not the case that when a child presents with a significant suicidal risk we can send him or her directly to Cork.  It is often the case that the child is kept at home by the parents and monitored on a daily basis by CAMHS.  Access to a bed may take three to four weeks.  Sometimes, if the child's condition deteriorates and he or she cannot be managed at home, he or she, as has happened in a number of cases, is admitted to the department of psychiatry in Waterford.  It is an adult psychiatry facility and no place for a child.  While there, a child is confined to a room on his or her own, accompanied by a psychiatric nurse and not allowed out of it during the hours the adult patients are moving around the facility.  It is my opinion that this simply contradicts what is in &quot;the best interests of a child&quot;.<br\/><br\/>We are all here to look at how best we can provide a service for those less fortunate than ourselves.  In my case, these are the children between the ages of six and 18 years who suffer from a mental illness.  Children commit suicide.  There were 70 children of schoolgoing age who took their own lives last year.  This does not account for the children between 16 and 18 years who were not at school.  We have a long history of not looking after the most vulnerable in society, from the Tuam mother and baby home, to Artane, the Magdalen laundries, Letterfrack industrial school and Wexford, where we had the Ferns and Monageer reports, to mention just a few.  We are again letting down the most vulnerable children in society.<br\/><br\/>We need A Vision for Change to be completed.  We need nurses to be paid at therapeutic grade level to keep them in the country.  We need a hospital liaison service and consultant cover.  We must realise that if we treat children with psychiatric problems when young, the vast majority will not need treatment as adults.  We need to stop embargoes on the recruitment of front-line staff.  Perhaps the embargoes should be placed elsewhere.  Those who manage the services should be held to account.  In a therapeutic role, if we are doing something that is not working for a child, we must stop and come back with a different idea.  The management system where I work seems to be doing more of the same when it is not working.  CAMHS should have an input at management level.  We also need access to emergency beds for children.  The Constitution states children should be cherished.  It is our duty to implement this right and look after children.  <br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for listening to my submission and welcome its work in forming a direction for mental health services in looking after children in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Did Mr. Walsh say there were 70 suicides last year of schoolgoing children?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>That is the report from the National Educational Psychological Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>That is just absolutely shocking.

The testimony has filled in some of the grey areas.  I appreciate the contributions of the delegates as a member of the committee but also personally.  Everybody has different expertise and mine is in the clinical area and on the business or management side.  Will the delegates tease out the recruitment matters?  It was indicated that the national recruitment process was not connecting with the local process.  If I remember correctly, candidates being screened were not being informed or matched specifically with teams.  Will the delegates flesh it out?  We are finding the big anomaly is in recruitment and that there has been a push-back by management which states it cannot find certain staff.  I worked in recruitment for eight years.  Mr. Walsh correctly referred to innovation within management and having to change things if they were not working.  We know that the definition is doing the same thing again and again while expecting a different result.  Recruitment is fluid.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh also referred to the commission on nursing and how it discouraged people from going into management.  Will he explain this a little more in order that we might be able to draw some correlations?  I was unaware of it.  He spoke about escalating to management proposals on how to improve matters, as have the others who presented.

I worked in the UK where recruitment is all done at local level.  Here we have panels where someone may be interviewed for a panel and may sit on that panel for year.  They will not know where a job will arise or when and they will never see the place in which they are to work prior to starting.  I interviewed in the UK as part of my role.  One would not be called for interview if one had not made an informal visit.  The interviews are done at local level by a local CAMHS team so a candidate will get to see the place and the people prior to working there.  How can we send people in to do jobs when they do not know where they are going to work?  They will not know if they are to work in a cupboard under the stairs, or the people with whom one will work.  One needs to know the people with whom one will work.  An interview is a two-way process and in Ireland we have a problem in that we think it is only one-way, that the employer has all the rights.  It should be 50:50 with the person who is coming for the job.  We are talking about transparency.  If we want people to commit to being in a post long term we need to treat them respectfully.  Recruitment needs to be done at local level.

These are the conversations we need to have.  I firmly believe in talking and awareness.  The World Health Organization identified mental health as one of the most important public health issues to promote, protect and invest in.  We are not doing enough.  I agree with the witnesses.  I constantly hear about waiting lists, lack of resources and the barriers to access.  Funding and recruitment are the biggest issues.<\/p> <p>  Last November, 2,223 children were on the HSE waiting list for child and adolescent mental health services.  There are families who are living in a nightmare, they are doing their best but they are also affected.  In situations where children and adolescents are left waiting, how can we help the wider family cope?  Can we put something like a virtual waiting room in place where families can receive support from CAMHS?  There is such a waiting list that there needs to be something available in the interim.  Providers have told me that the first port of call for families in distress needs to be strengthened.  Families are often referred to psychiatric services when there might be an alternative.  That is another issue on which the witnesses might respond to me.  <\/p> <p>  Should GPs be given tools to deal with less urgent cases?  Often people are left on waiting lists for lengthy periods when other avenues could be examined rather than compel them to be referred by their GP.<\/p> <p>  On the age limit for CAMHS, does the service continue until the 18th birthday when an adult service kicks in or is it at 17 and a half years, when an adolescent can fall between two stools?  I have seen some cases recently where that has happened.  <\/p> <p>  My other question relates to my area of Carlow and Kilkenny.  I have been asked this and I do not know the answer.  When a child or adolescent displays disturbing behaviour, is there a facility in my area for them to be taken into?  Information has been circulating but I want to clarify this.  There are not many places nationally but can the witnesses tell me if there are any places in the Carlow Kilkenny area?      <\/p> <p>  I am familiar with a case where a doctor has made four referrals to CAMHS, but the person in question did not meet the threshold.  When a doctor refers a patient to CAMHS and they are refused four times because they do not meet the criteria, can the witnesses explain this?  I think thresholds should be examined.  Can the witnesses tell me more about that?  <\/p> <p>  Is it the case that there are only 69 beds for minors in the whole country?<\/p> <p>  I am aware of four minors in the south east who are in adult wards because there are no suitable beds.

That does not happen because many adult psychiatrists will not accept referrals from CAMHS.<\/p> <p>  On Carlow-Kilkenny and someone struggling emotionally, unless that child has a working diagnosis of a mental condition they cannot be contained in any particular psychiatric unit.

We are not talking about what some people would refer to as \"soft psychiatry\" where somebody needs to discuss things and would benefit from counselling.  If a child had a substance misuse, they would go to somebody dealing with substance abuse.

The screening process is quite detailed, but if we had somebody coming back two or three times, we would be on to the GP and asking what is actually going on.

Certainly my experience was that CAMHS was very much the default position.  I was lucky enough to work in one CAMHS area, which was at one stage,relatively well resourced in terms of other community services.  This is in contrast to the UK, where there is a tiered approach and often young people would have been to one, two or sometimes three services before being referred to CAMHS and many intervention assessments would have already been carried out.  Let me give an example of what is happening in CAMHS.  I worked in another area, where there was no primary care psychology, so that cases which probably would have been much better served by primary care psychology services were referred directly to CAMHS.  I never worked in an area where there was a local autism spectrum disorder, ASD, team so it led to a great many referrals for ASD assessments for young people without comorbid mental health difficulties.  It is quite stigmatising for young people if they are referred to a service which is envisaged to provide a service for severe mental health difficulties when an ASD assessment is the primary need.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the lack of integration of services, currently we would work with a number of young people who are involved in a number of different services, it might be CAMHS, Tusla, inpatient services and I think there are more meetings of professionals being held to try to integrate these services.  It is like the two Luas lines joining up.

I actually think some of these services should be joined up.  We have a a paediatrician from the North who is coming on Friday to speak to our team.  In the United Kingdom, some 50% of ADHD cases are seen by the paediatrics service.  They are treated, diagnosed, and managed by paediatrics, whereas in the Republic of Ireland, it is all managed by the child and adolescent mental health service.  We need to look at other ways of providing services, such as neurodevelopmental teams, where we can deal with ASD and CAMHS.  We need paediatric staff on those teams, because these children often have other conditions as well.  We need a wraparound service.  Currently what is happening is that children may be coming to CAMHS for ADHD, they are sent down the road for ASD and then in the meantime they may be referred on to the paediatric service for certain screeners.  I have a child who has been waiting 18 months currently for an endocrine screener before we can actually treat the child.  Our hands are tied.  We cannot do an intervention because we do not know what else is going on for him.

Talk therapy would not have taken her out of it; she needed something in the nature of a medication to bring her up.  Sometimes that happens.  When someone is brought back up, it is easier to provide talk therapy.  The gold standard in the treatment of ADHD is behavioural therapy and medication.

What are the outstanding aspects that need to be completed?<\/p> <p>  We talked about nurses.  The issues they face constitute a huge challenge across all sectors.  We see members of the Army and the Air Corps signing up as pilots.  We are losing nurses to other areas.  What can we do that will be effective?  It is very frustrating that people are trained to a certain level and then, because of market forces, they move away.  What exactly is therapeutic grade?  <\/p> <p>  We face a huge difficulty in the appointment of consultants.  Most come from the United Kingdom.  There was a pay cap.  Do the delegates know how it affected the the appointment of consultants?  I know that it had an effect in some places and there was no way around it.  It was something for which everyone was calling when the country was effectively broke, but it was introduced without any flexibility.  Is it having an effect?  Capital projects and providing new buildings are the least of our problems; it is how one staffs them.  I found that if one employed people locally in other professions - let us say, for one facility - their career prospects would be somewhat limited.  I refer to a local hospital, Roscommon University Hospital.  In the Saolta group we could not find nurses, doctors or, especially, consultants.  We brought them in under the Saolta group.  The group employs everyone in counties Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Donegal and Sligo and it seems to have worked a lot better, but the delegates are probably saying there is also a need for flexibility.<\/p> <p>  I must again raise a legacy issue in County Roscommon.  If the delegates know it, they will know that the mental health services are not fit for purpose.  Five years ago there was a &euro;20 million investment and the provision of an endoscopy unit which cost &euro;7 million or &euro;8 million.  We have the rehab unit for the west and an eight-bed palliative care unit.  We wanted to go straight back out and effectively build a brand new mental health service.  We were waiting six months, but they came back and said no and told us that it would inconvenience staff and patients.  However, five years later, after all of the various developments, people are calling for a new building.  As a politician, I am really frustrated that we could not receive the co-operation of the HSE, as it has cost us millions.  We have built the endoscopy unit and are now trying to build around it.  When the funding was available, we just could not receive co-operation and I do not know who to blame.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#H00700","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I do not think either Mr. Walsh or Ms Magaharan would be able to comment on the last issue about which the Senator talked, but I also sense his frustration.

It has not been fully implemented.  As a bare minimum, it needs to be implemented.  In particular, it is a matter of looking at investment in community services in the first instance to ensure all of the recommended CAMHS teams are available and fully staffed.  My colleagues have highlighted deficits which I have also experienced.  These days families are much more informed.  When they come to services with a young person with OCD, they know that cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT, is an evidence-based approach and ask for it.  They are very well aware of the deficits within the team.  It is, therefore, a matter of staffing and putting resources into the community teams in the first instance, certainly in liaison psychiatry.  I worked in liaison psychiatry in one of the few such services in the country.  On the whole, we were discharging young people from medical beds the next day - it is not the most appropriate placement for a young person with mental health difficulties - once they were medically stable, whereas if there was no psychiatrist available, a young person might have had to wait in a paediatric bed for quite some time in the absence of a mental health assessment to inform the medical practitioners that it was actually safe to send the young person home.<\/p> <p>  Another area at which to look that is really helpful is the day hospital, as it gives timely access to young people in crisis.  There are very few day hospitals in the country.  The one that was in Dublin is now shut and unavailable.  Because of this sometimes there is nowhere else to send an acutely unwell young person where CAMHS is not sufficient to meet his or her needs and he or she needs a more intensive service.  If there is no day hospital available for a young person in his or her locality, he or she will attend inpatient services which puts more pressure on and blocks capacity in them.  Conversely, when one is discharging a young person, one wants to minimise the time he or she will spend in an inpatient unit.  However, if there is no step-down facility available in a day hospital, he or she might actually remain in an inpatient unit for an extended period because the gap in intensity between CAMHS and the inpatient unit is huge.  It is really a matter of looking at investment in community services, as well as the additional 100 beds envisioned in A Vision for Change to meet the needs of the population at the time.  We probably need A Vision for Change for children and adolescents alone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aileen Murtagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>To go back to Senator Frank Feighan's question about nurse training, we are training nurses for export.  In this country we have treated nurses terribly in recent years.  Their wages were cut between 2011 and 2015 to 85% of staff nurses' wages.  This caused many nurses to leave the country and they are still leaving.  They are being trained here but going out the door the minute they have been trained.  They are not even waiting to gain experience.  One would normally wait for six months to gain experience, but they are leaving in droves.  It must be said the packages in England are very good for anyone who wants to further his or her career.  If I were 21 years old again and had just started training, I would be out the door.

The system is absolutely shocking, disgusting and disgraceful and the staff who work in the sector have been treated like dogs.  I have never heard so much honesty as I have heard today.  I cannot believe that people had to wait 14.5 years for a liaison team.<\/p> <p>  It is 2018 yet Mr. Walsh has said that he cannot offer the service he offered the previous week and they lose the trust and credibility which they work so hard to earn by not being able to offer a service.

I have a number of questions but I will concentrate on this matter.  I admire the courage shown by Ms Magaharan and Mr. Walsh.  I do not want to put them on the spot.   However, I will ask them two questions that they can choose not to answer.  The truth must be told.  I detest box ticking exercises and making up excuses that staff cannot be got and posts cannot be filled, talking in percentages and that one place is oversubscribed but people cannot be moved from A to B to fill vacancies in another team.

I am black and blue from approaching Ministers and telling them what does not work and asking for staff.  We know why staff cannot be recruited because the Government will not pay them and give them self-worth.  The witnesses hit the nail on the head when they identified the problem as the amount being spent on agency staff.  I have spoken to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, about the matter.  As much as &euro;2 million a week is spent on agency staff.  It will cost &euro;1.2 million per year to fix the gap generated from 2011 to 2014, inclusive.  Is there a political will to do so?  No.  Who is responsible?  The last Government and the present one.  I do not want the problem to persist on my watch.  The people present and their colleagues deserve more.  I cannot understand why the Government has not realised that prevention is better than cure.  What will people do?  To use a medical analogy, the Government waits for problems to fester and simply applies a bandage rather than a cast at the very start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#J00800","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1524054600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>The state of the service angers me and I apologise for my outburst.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#J01000","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>No need.

Many young people who come to the unit for the first time have very pre-conceived notions of what an inpatient unit looks like and most expect it to be very dull and dreary and contain straitjackets.  They are quite surprised to see that it is bright and cheerful.  Having worked in the public and independent sectors, I recognise that there are similarities between them.  People who work on the front line with young people are extremely dedicated and do their best, often with very few resources.  That is a definite similarity.<\/p> <p>  In my current post, my job is far easier and I have more time for front-line work with children and families.  My colleagues highlighted issues such as administrative deficits.  I have not opened a door, written a letter or had to listen to an answering machine since I started in my current post because there is excellent administrative support and cover for leave.  Such things make a huge difference.  If that support was not available, I might have to check the answering machine three or four times a day, which is fine but means an hour of my clinical time is spent answering a phone rather than providing emergency assessment to a young person, for example.  The training of nurses and allied heath professionals is very much supported.<\/p> <p>  The issue of recruitment and candidates not matching the required skill set was mentioned.  Allied health professionals in the HSE are recruited from a panel.  If a position becomes available, such as a senior clinical psychology post in adult mental health services, and the geographical location of the job suits the person at the top of the panel, because there is no clarity on when or where the next job may be he or she might accept the post even if he or she has no training in adult psychiatry and had been working in CAMHS for seven years.  Such a recruit might stay in the adult service for two or three years until another post became available in CAMHS.  In St. Patrick's there is a specific advertisement and a candidate whose skill set specifically matches the needs of the young people and the service is recruited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aileen Murtagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":351,"content":"<p>That seems to make much sense.

That was put in place following the nurses' strike in 1999.  It resulted in an expansion of nursing roles such that nurses did not all have to go into managerial roles but could stay in the clinical practice which they love.  Will it take another strike or commission to ensure that we retain staff?  Like the witnesses, I contacted staff who had gone abroad, who said there was no way they would come back because of the disrespect shown to them by the HSE before they left.  There is no encouragement or offering of professional development because all one does day in, day out is fight fires and there is time for nothing else.

However, there are no hospital-based teams to liaise with and go into maternity and paediatric hospitals in spite of there being a great need to assess patients there on a medical level.  The important role of public health nurses in terms of going into homes should also be addressed.

What front-line staff are facing is brutal and horrible.  A catalogue of failures in psychiatric services means that many people have been failed by the system, and they will end up in a bad place.  From the testimony I understand that psychiatric services in Ireland are undervalued, underfunded and understaffed.  As other Deputies have said, other Governments have put the service into this disarray.  Issues retaining staff, maintaining staff morale and indeed the pay and conditions of staff lead to this catalogue of errors.  The chairperson of the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland, PNA, was before this committee recently,and, as Senator Devine said, one could hear a pin drop.  It was terrible.  Sometimes there are many adjectives to use.  We can give out, but there seems to be a perennial crisis in our mental health services, and if we do not deal with this as a country, and as elected representatives, it will continue.  It is good to hear front-line staff speaking out about this, because they are the people who will change the system ultimately through the unions.<\/p> <p>  My questions are quite detailed and I am not sure if Dr. Murtagh will be able to answer them now, but perhaps she could revert when possible.

I am from Wexford, and desperate parents ring me on a regular basis.  One of the most horrendous things CAMHS in Wexford has to do is the triaging of desperate children.  Children desperately need to be seen, and staff have to make a decision as to which are the worst cases when they all need to be seen.  I have been told that a child is 30th on a list, then 12th and then they slip out further on the list because a worse case has appeared.  However, every child on the list is in a very desperate situation.  I can only imagine the mental health impacts on staff; it must be horrendous.  If the witnesses get an opportunity perhaps they would address the impact working in such a service has on them.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh mentioned that he had to travel to Cork, some 200 km away, to get an inpatient bed.  I deal with many parents who are left in an invidious position whereby their children are left in the adult unit in Waterford, which I have visited and which is an extremely grim place which is not fit for purpose for adults, never mind children.  Children are either left there or have to travel to Cork, Galway or Dublin.  Perhaps the witnesses could discuss their experiences of the impact of that on parents and children.<\/p> <p>  In terms of retention of staff, we have heard about the issues of pay, but many nurses have told me that the conditions of work are horrendous and that no pay would convince them to stay on.  I am talking about trying to triage in desperate situations, or not getting enough time to liaise with patients properly because there are other patients right behind who desperately need to be seen.  Can the witnesses talk about the impact of that?<\/p> <p>  I recently spoke to an associate professor from America who was considering moving to Ireland.  He does not work in the mental health sphere.  He is the kind of person we should be begging to come to Ireland.  He was shocked at the hoops his family was being made to jump through to actually take up a position.  Furthermore, in America he had a massive support team, including secretaries, in addition to the actual health care team.  He realised that if he got a position in Ireland he would be spending his first two years trying to put a team together, without proper supports, instead of actually seeing patients.<\/p><p>That seems to be one of the key issues.  In terms of mental healthcare, we are almost in a death spiral now.  One cannot get people to take the jobs because the conditions are so bad and the conditions will not improve unless one makes it better for people to take up those jobs.  I suppose I am highlighting some of the issues.  If anybody wants to know why we have statistically the fourth highest spend <i>per capita<\/i>on healthcare and yet probably the worst healthcare system in the western world, it is the dysfunctionality.

The Deputy asked about the impact on the parents and on the child of being admitted to an adult psychiatric hospital.  It has to be devastating.  A child is admitted aged 14, 15 or 16 to an adult psychiatric ward.  He or she is not allowed out onto the ward during the hours where the adult patients are moving around that facility.  He or she is only allowed out in the company of a psychiatric nurse.  If one brings the mother or father of that child into that facility, he or she cannot stay there and be with him or her.  There is nowhere for the parent to stay in that facility.  When the child is admitted to our inpatient unit in Cork, there is no place for the parents to stay when they visit that patient.<\/p> <p>  In England and every other developed service, one allows parents to stay with their child.  The policy is that one would try to keep services near the patient.  This is clearly not happening.  We had Planning for the Future in 1984, if anyone remembers it.  There was to be a 20-bed unit attached to every general hospital in the country, which would make sense for Wexford.  Instead traipsing across the county trying to get to Waterford to be treated, people could go locally to their own Wexford General Hospital and be managed there.  One would have the psychiatric situation sorted and dealt with in that area.  I listen to parents every day of the week who are devastated that their children are in an adult psychiatric hospital.  As far as I am concerned, it is against the Geneva Convention and human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#M01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1524054600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>There must be an additional stigma then attached to the children being in an adult ward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#M01400","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Children do not vote and they do not get a say in where they are going or what they are doing.

We try to admit to St. Patrick's and St. John of God on occasion but at present we have four patients on a waiting list to go into inpatients.  There are no beds in the inn.

I thank them for that.<\/p> <p>  Earlier, Ms Magaharan spoke about the neurological conditions and she spoke about ASD in the same breath.  It is something I would like her to expand on.  Those listening today might want to know where the link is because in many of the other CHOs and CAMHS, they might be getting the run around.  I am from Galway.  I was at an ASD meeting yesterday and heard the voices of parents who were all getting the run around.  That is why I want to focus in on that.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Aileen Murtagh spoke about what she has observed.  In her presentation, she observed that the GPs are making referrals in order to get a quick appointment and also the use of medical beds.  That is the point on which I want to come in.  Deputy Browne discussed beds in adult wards.  I am only talking about the use of medical beds maybe not meeting the needs of the children either, which is a huge issue.<\/p> <p>  Then I want to talk about the sixth class children who have never had an assessment all the way through and whose parents have tried to get into CAMHS - I would not say there are roadblocks - but whose needs assessment was not high enough to get support.  Now they are in sixth class, a few weeks from going to secondary school, and they still have not got the supports.  They are going into secondary school with nothing in place and the parents are panicking.  My fear is they will end up back in CAMHS in a situation that is possibly a hell of a lot worse than if they had got the early intervention.  I want to know about such children who are presenting and what sort of a workload it is to the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  The same happens for those aged 17 and a half where the issue possibly has floated along and there has not been the support.  I want to hear what the witnesses are experiencing in terms of the frustration of the parents who do not know where to turn.

What happens here is the child comes into CAMHS because we do not know what he or she has and we say maybe this guy has ASD.

If she was charged with murder she would have an hour of fresh air a day but she gets none.  Instead, she is listening to a man crying and screaming in a room beside her.  It is one of the reasons I am very curious about the relationship between St. Patrick's and the HSE.  Dr. Murtagh mentioned there has been an increase in requests from the HSE.  Why is that?

We do not tend to get many referrals of young people in adult psychiatric wards.  We have had quite a number of young people who have been in medical beds, generally in paediatric wards, which are not suitable places either for young people.  They are not subject to the same restrictions that were mentioned, like being confined to a room, but we had one young person who was admitted after six weeks in Crumlin hospital.  They are not geared up to meet the needs of these young people.  Their sleep will have been very poor for six weeks because of the screaming babies or medical emergencies.  Sleep is very important in terms of mental health.  There is also no access to therapeutic programmes.  In units like ours there is a group psychotherapeutic programme running Monday to Friday.  Other than school, the young people have had very little to do.  In essence they are in a medical bed although they do not have a medical need.  They may have had initial medical needs but those needs are no longer a live issue but as a result of the level of risk, they remain in a medical bed until a bed becomes available in a psychiatric unit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018041800002#O02200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aileen Murtagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":440,"content":"<p>That is the first time I have heard that.

Systematic analysis of capacity requirements should be a normal component of any healthcare system's planning cycle.  The last review for Ireland was undertaken in 2007 and focused only on hospital bed capacity.  This review was asked to provide a more wide-ranging assessment to include the capacity needs in both primary care and social care services for older people as well as in acute hospitals.  The review quantifies the demand and future capacity implications across these three domains, which are those most affected by an ageing population and rising prevalence of long-term conditions.  This also aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare report finding that the best health outcomes and value for money can be achieved by reorienting the model of care towards primary and community care.<\/p> <p>  The report sets out our assessment of current capacity, future demand and the impact of future reforms to provide two ends of a spectrum of potential future capacity needs.  We will say more on each of these.  We have established an agreed view of the current capacity across the public and private sectors.  This was determined using two methods.  One was by looking at available resource data from 2016 and the second was by cross-checking with available activity data for 2016, which gives an added level of confidence in the baseline position for 2016 and allows us to reconcile any anomalies.  In addition, we looked at the most recently available international benchmarking from the OECD and EUROSTAT to compare capacity in Ireland to six countries, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland.<\/p> <p>  We looked at the drivers of future demand and estimated them to produce our view of the impact on future capacity requirements to 2031, creating the baseline for the assessment.  Those drivers have been categorised in three ways.  First is demographic, which relates to the growth and changing age structure of the population, notably the rise in the older population in Ireland being particularly dramatic.  This aligns with what the committee has already heard from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  Second are non-demographic drivers, relating to other influences such as changes in medical practice, for instance the trends towards minimally invasive and day case surgery, and the increased prevalence of chronic disease.  Third is addressing unmet demand.  Waiting lists have been used to estimate unmet demand and the report incorporates the additional capacity needed to reduce waiting lists to an acceptable norm over a four year period.  We then set out an analysis of how key changes to the model of care could impact on future demand and capacity across the system.  The review developed three main reform scenarios drawing on a review of current policies, published evidence and international comparators.  These were tested through engagement with a wide range of stakeholders including the Department's international peer review group.<\/p> <p>  The reform scenarios align with current national policies and the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  In particular, they are based around the need to shift care away from an acute-led model, and they assume more integrated care, particularly for management of chronic conditions and care of older people.  They have been defined and modelled in a way that enables us to add them together to come up with an overall assessment of the capacity implications.<\/p><p>The three reform scenarios cover, first, the impact of the healthy Ireland strategy on demand that would be attributable to a broad range of initiatives including actions on tobacco, alcohol and obesity; second, an improved model of care centred around comprehensive community-based services; and third, hospital productivity improvements.  We have taken account of how care needs to be delivered as locally as is clinically appropriate and only centralised where necessary.  Productivity improvements come through improved patient flows through hospitals as well as improvements associated with elective-only sites.  We also noted that much of the evidence for centralising more specialised services relates to improved clinical outcomes more than reducing bed demand.  <\/p><p> In addition, the report also sets out the capacity implications of reducing the average bed occupancy from the current high levels.  <\/p><p> Our headline findings are that the baseline scenario - and I remind members that this involves scaling the current model of care - would require significant increases in capacity across all aspects of the health service up to 2031, including an increase of 7,150 hospital beds on top of the current 13,310.  This factors in the improved occupancy levels and is more than a 50% increase.  It equates to opening a new 550 bed hospital like Tallaght every year from 2018 onwards.  This is still accompanied by significant increases elsewhere across the system: a 30% increase in primary care workforce, a 40% increase in residential care beds and a 70% increase in home care over the period to 2031.  <\/p><p> Moving towards the other end of the spectrum one will find that full implementation of all three reforms would alter the capacity needed across all sectors by 2031 to 2,590 extra hospital beds including around 2,100 inpatient, 300 day case, and 190 adult critical care beds.  This a reduction of 4,560 on the baseline scenario and brings the new capacity down to opening a new 550 bed hospital every third year.  <\/p><p> To achieve this there is an even larger increase in the capacity needed elsewhere in the system, including a further 11.5% points increase in the primary care workforce, making a the total increase of 48%; an additional 1,100 residential care beds, bringing the total extra needed to 13,000; and a further 50% increase in home care (home help hours and home care packages), making the total increase 120%.  In undertaking the review, we have drawn on a wide range of sources, and we have also encountered the well documented limitations of the data available within the system.  In this respect, the analysis of hospital bed capacity is considered robust and provides a sound basis for planning.  There was insufficient data available within the timescales of the review to forecast beyond beds to include specific hospital facilities such as operating theatres and computed tomography, CT scanners.  These would need to be picked up at the next stage as more detailed planning and designs for new facilities are developed.  Our analysis has been sensitive to the specific context in Ireland, for instance in respect of the mix of public and private healthcare, the role of GPs and the nature of the social care services available.  The core of the analysis draws on activity trends as seen in Hospital Inpatient Enquiry, HIPE, and other data sources.  In developing the reform scenarios, we have not just used international comparators, we have drawn on a range of other sources including peer reviewed studies, comparisons of performance across different parts of the system in Ireland, and the views of the many stakeholders engaged through workshops and consultation, as well as the advice from the international peer review group.  The review was asked to inform the development of a national development plan for the next decade and in particular on the scale of the capital infrastructure that will be needed.  Our findings have been accepted by Government and provision for them included in the recently published national development plan.  The Department of Health also have our model and are using it to do more evidence-based planning. <\/p><p> In conclusion, the analysis has established two extremes that define the order of magnitude and range of potential capacity needs and associated the level of changes to the model of care.  The scope of the review did not extend to a comprehensive workforce capacity assessment and one will be needed to assess the rate at which capacity in various parts of the system could be brought into service.  The report sets out the landscape.  Continuing with the current model of care, which is the baseline scenario, will see demand exceed capacity by over 7,000 hospital beds by 2031.  The combined reform scenarios are ambitious.  Noting the complexity involved in bringing a new hospital into service, we believe the combined reform scenarios are likely to be the more feasible option and this is the right basis to move planning to the next level of detail as set out in our recommendations for next steps.  Lastly, may we please place on record our sincere thanks for the significant contributions made by the many people and organisations who were engaged in the review process through meetings, workshops and in contributing to the Department&rsquo;s consultation?  The full report has been circulated to the committee and is publicly available on the Department's website.

On the one hand we have had change in the Irish health system in the past three years with an additional 11,400 people now working in the healthcare sector compared to December 2014.  I am not satisfied additional services are being delivered.  I am concerned about how we can increase the workforce on one level but at the same time not be able to deliver the service to the people who need it on the other side.  I am wondering from the work the consultants have undertaken how they see the process improving in terms of delivering these additional services.  The best example of all is the children's hospital which has taken us nearly 25 years.  The presentation this morning referred to the provision of a new 550 bed unit, literally, every year and then to a delivery every three years.  To deliver it even every three years will be a huge demand.  How does one fast track something like that?  From Mr. MacGinnis's experience, what needs to be done?  There is the whole process of identifying a suitable site,  going through the planning process, going through the appeal process, getting the work done, and then the other issue on staffing.  <\/p> <p> On the staffing of our hospitals OECD reports indicate that we have a ratio of nurses per head of population that is one of the best in the world.  If that is the position, how does one deal with the increase in the number of hospital beds if one already has a high ratio of nurses per head of population; how then is the service delivered?  Do we grow the number of nursing positions again or does one start looking to where the work that nurses are doing now could be done by care assistants?  We need to protect the nursing jobs but we also need to make sure that they have backup support.  How could that be dealt with?<\/p> <p>  The third issue concerns a totally different matter.  When we introduced the fair deal scheme in Ireland, which is for nursing homes, it was a new type of delivery of service.  It was introduced and put in place over a short enough timeframe and has delivered.<\/p><p>The problem now is that there are approximately 23,500 people in private nursing homes, plus a further 6,000 in community hospital facilities.  There are approximately 637,000 elderly people in the State.  By 2030, that figure will be 1 million.  A proportionate increase in nursing home bed numbers would see us needing in or around 40,000 beds.  To avoid it, home care provision would have to be increased.  The delegates referred to a 70% increase in that regard.  My concern is whether we will have an adequate number of people to provide that service.  How do the delegates suggest we deal with recruiting them?  On what do we need to focus if we are to get more people involved in providing what is a superb service for those who require it?  Have the delegates only examined this question to the point of saying provision needs to be increased or have they actually analysed how we should increase it?  We must increase it at a fast pace every year from now on, but I am concerned that we will not have enough people to provide the service.  These are just some questions that immediately pop up from what the delegates have said.<\/p><p> As to structures in hospitals, a question arises as to whether we should change the role of nursing.  The majority of nurses now have academic qualifications, but, to a large extent, we have not increased the role they play with patients.  Many nurses are more than adequately qualified to deal with a lot of the issues junior doctors are handling.  Should we examine workplace practices and the delegation of duties within hospitals?  For instance, there is a significant reliance on junior doctors that is not seen in other countries where there are more structured systems under which permanent and nursing staff deliver services effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#E00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":458,"content":"<p>As I have a number of questions, will I just ask one or two now and contribute again later?

The main table shows the numbers of GPs, acute beds, ICU beds, physios and everything else, but it is not a full systems review.  It is only a review of acute services and excludes mental health and palliative care services.  My understanding is that within primary community care services the review focuses on the elderly.  I will ask my first question and leave it at that for now.  How incomplete is the picture the table provides?  I do not mean that as a criticism of the work done.  For example, if the capacity review shows that, in the reform scenario, we need 2,590 additional acute beds, would the total number of acute beds be likely to increase by much were the Department to commission the PA Consulting Group to undertake a full system review?  Similarly, there is a significant number of additional GPs, physiotherapists, allied health professionals and practice nurses, but my concern is that, while the acute review might be reasonably comprehensive, the primary care services review is limited because it is focused on elderly persons.  Will the delegates give us a sense of how much of the picture we are seeing?  Based on their experience of this sort of analysis abroad, is it likely that the total projected numbers of GPs, practice nurses and so on would be significantly higher than what we are seeing if their group was to carry out a full system review of community, primary and social care services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#F00800","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  I get a little confused from time to time, as the Vice Chairman knows.  What confuses me are the confused responses we receive to our questions.  For instance, I have heard expert opinion to the effect that we have too many hospital beds.  Needless to say, I did not agree with it at the time.  On the other hand, it has been stated we have significantly undersupplied hospital registrars.  I am agreeable enough with that opinion.<\/p> <p>  To what degree did the PA Consulting Group examine the issue of bed shortages?  How intensive was the research?  For instance, did the delegates find out why and for how long a patient was waiting for a bed, how many patients were waiting to get into hospital for appointments and how many children were waiting?  It is disgraceful and ludicrous that we must time and again deal with the same issue and ask ourselves why it is happening.  Why is it happening?  Has the research the delegates have undertaken adequately addressed the underlying issues?  Concern has been expressed previously about the ageing population.  I have been guilty of doing this from time to time, but I will also point out that the young population is also increasing, much more so than in any other European country.  That fact is pushed to one side and never forms part of our considerations when planning for the future.<\/p> <p>  Have the delegates taken into account that, if there are extra beds, there will also have to be extra nurses, which is what representatives of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, said when they appeared before us a number of weeks ago?

Donnelly's and Bernard J. Durkan's questions.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight four aspects that we believe are important if progress is to be made in the reform and provision of capacity, the first of which is securing and maintaining clinical leadership in order that there is ownership of the reforms by the clinical body.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect is how one supports hospital groups in operating effectively as a network, including legal regulatory elements to ensure there are incentives for people to work and deliver care in a more integrated way.  In particular and linked with the Senator's question about some of the problems in having the children's hospital established, there is the question of how to win hearts and minds among the clinicians and the public for service reconfiguration.  With specialist services in particular, there is a good case for specialising when necessary and localising where one can, but there is also a hearts and minds element because in these situations care is often moving to a different location.<\/p> <p>  The third aspect we wish to highlight is aligning the hospital groups with the CHOs in order that Ireland can start moving towards population health planning.<\/p> <p>  The final aspect is detailed control, management and planning of any provision of extra capacity.  Unless one monitors the position closely, one can easily provide extra capacity without getting the reform that is supposed to go with it.  Behind it comes a load of more detailed work that one would need to do, particularly on the workforce.  Mr. Nightingale will discuss the units of workforce that we used.  The detailed work can be more nuanced in terms of the skill mix that lies behind some of the job titles that we have used in our modelling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Daly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Mr. MacGinnis will answer the question asked about nursing, while I will answer the scope question about workforce capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Nightingale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I will give an introduction to the nursing problem.  We talk in the report about the immediate injection of the capacity needed to get occupancy levels down to an acceptable norm.  We make the point that, although we have quantified it in bed terms, in practical terms the measures that need to be used are very similar to those with which members will be familiar from the winter pressure planning process.  A combination of things are needed to improve patient flow.  In other industries that would be called productivity.  There is a need to look at blockages in the system.  That is why it was particularly important to look at capacity outside, as well as inside, hospitals.  I know from my experience of working in the system here that this is a key driver of extended lengths of stay, particularly among older people.  There are also internal measures that can be taken.  When we worked with the national clinical programmes in Tallaght, we could see that there was significant potential for improvements in patient flow within the main wards in the hospital, even in the emergency department and the acute medical units on the acute floor.  Patients were being admitted who would not necessarily have needed to be admitted if the right tests and the right things had been done on time.  It is possible for people to be given morning-after appointments in order that they do not have to wait overnight in the emergency department in circumstances in which they are not going to be seen.  Comprehensive geriatric assessments can be made in order that patients who need to be admitted can be moved on quickly and effectively from the acute medical assessment unit.  There are many productivity improvements that could be made.<\/p> <p>  Questions were asked about the staffing of hospitals and workforce reforms.  We did not make a comprehensive workforce assessment.  The review has significant workforce implications for capacity within hospitals and other areas.  As Mr. Daly has alluded to, workforce reform should be on the cards when the scale of things is examined, but it is not something we have looked at specifically.  It is really a matter for the professions to get together and agree what the suitable roles are.  I have mentioned the work we are doing with the national clinical programmes in Tallaght.  One of the simple measures on which we worked with them involved doctors being able to delegate to nurses the authority to discharge patients at the weekend.  We worked with them on a paper form to authorise nurses to get on with discharging patients whose test results had come back with certain acceptable results without having to wait for the next ward round.  The presence of advanced nurse practitioners is another example of the measures being introduced.  Such personnel can engage in all sorts of duty, including prescribing.  Consideration could also be given to workforce reform for care assistants in other areas.  The scale we have set out means that there is no silver bullet.  The comprehensive package of reforms we are discussing is akin to some of the reforms that were on the cards previously, as clearly outlined in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report last year.  We expect it to come through.  <\/p> <p>  I want to make sure I have answered the question about the changing role of nurses.  I think I wrapped it up in my response to the two other questions.  In summary, this is a big reform package.  It is not just about providing capacity anywhere.  As Mr. Daly said, if capacity is the only thing that is introduced, it will be used in the same old way - it will block up in same old way and we will get the same old results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly's questions about the scope of the review.  Some good questions were asked.  The exclusion of mental health and disability services from the scope of the review was agreed at the start when the terms were set out by the Department.  The main reason for the exclusion was the potential lack of availability of good and timely data in the areas of mental health and disability services.  Given that ongoing work was being carried out in these areas and in light of the timescale for the project, it was felt it was better to focus on acute primary care and social care services.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second point was related to the resources included in the primary care part of the study.  As he pointed out, we picked up on GPs, nurses and some of the allied health professionals in the study because of the availability of relatively good data for the numbers of resources in these areas and the activities undertaken by these professionals.  The data in question were broken down on a granular level in terms of the patients they were seeing.  This meant that we could do our demand forecasting on the same basis as the other parts of the modelling.  I would not expect the addition of additional resources to have an impact on the results achieved on the basis of the resources included in the report.  The inclusion of other resources in the outputs would give a further richness to the report.  By including other primary care resources in the modelling, we would see the impact on them.  It would not have a significant impact on the resources already included in the review.  We are relatively confident that the resources at which we have looked would be taken into account in the modelling.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a particular question about the over 65s.  The second scenario we set out focused on the elderly cohort of patients and particularly the chronic conditions suffered by such patients.  Essentially, we analysed whether we had missed the impact on those under the age of 65 years.  As a baseline, we looked at primary care services across all three sectors and patients of all ages.  This ensured the total population was included.  Our analysis was not limited to those over the age of 65 years.  As has been pointed out, the particular scenario we considered looked at changes in the model of care for patients over the age of 65 years.  There were two reasons for this.  First, given that the main impact of this scenario would be on the over-65 years population, we felt that by considering them we would cover the main impacts on chronic conditions of changes in primary care services.  Second, we wanted to enable the scenarios to be added together.  When we were looking at improvements in hospitals in the third scenario - the efficiency scenarios in hospitals and hospital systems - we mainly looked at people under the age of 65 years.  This meant that when we were adding the scenarios at the end of the report and looking at their combined effect on the baseline, we could be confident that we were not double-counting impacts from overlapping scenarios.  By ensuring the combination of the three scenarios could be additive and, therefore, their combined impact could be seen, we could deliver a simpler story and message at the end of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Nightingale"},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I will repeat my main question for the purposes of clarity.

Behavioural economics provides us with compelling evidence that we use and, in most cases, over-use things that are completely free.

What assumptions are made in the two future scenarios?  Is it assumed in either scenario, as per the Sl&aacute;intecare report, that acute primary care essentially will become free at the point of use for everybody?

I fully understand the questions and their thrust.  As we work from where we are to getting a comprehensive solution, we need to put a few building blocks in place to develop a more sophisticated analysis.  Doing an overview of capacity needs based on an assessment of the demand and the trends of the demand is the right first step.  As I indicated in the opening statement, that sets out a landscape around which we go.  It is not that we have then not done a workforce assessment.  Why do we think it is the right landscape to go for?  We know we have not modelled all the workforce in detail and we have set out very clearly a recommendation that a comprehensive workforce assessment is needed.  As we worked up the scenarios, we pulled together workshops with a number of very senior people from across the system.  These were not just system leaders but representatives from patient bodies and the like.  We worked through with them the scenario in reality and what it means for Ireland.  We looked at what is a reasonable quantification for the scenario.  The way we constructed those takes account of people's views of what they think was deliverable, knowing that what we are giving is a broad order assessment of what is needed.<\/p> <p>  Both ends of the spectrum are pretty horrendous in terms of implications.  Members have already pointed out the business of how long it takes to build a hospital.  One asked a question specifically about expert opinion on there being too many beds.  That was a view put forward by one of the members of the OECD panel and the view was that other countries are not building beds.  When we considered it with the other members of the international peer review group, we saw that those countries that are beginning to get away with fewer beds than recommended have already done significant reform in their primary and community care and are already supporting patients in different ways.  Given where Ireland is, it is a reasonable capacity assessment.  Given the time and difficulty in bringing in capital infrastructure, one that looks to the minimum one can get away with is the best.<\/p> <p>  This leaves us with profound questions about how to get capacity and how to address the fair deal question, for example.  It is about how to build that capacity in Ireland and the mechanisms for doing that.  We have not looked at that in detail.  As I stated, we have had some expert opinions from people across the system who have helped to shape those scenarios.  The next stage is to look at that in detail.  If we contrast the 2007 review with this one, in financial terms this iteration poses many more revenue and expenditure questions than were ever posed in the 2007 review.  It puts on the table a much more comprehensive financial view of the scale likely to be needed.  As I said, there are two extremes and perhaps the achievable goal will be somewhere in between.  We think it will be closer to the reforms scenario option than the building option as we go on.  Does that help to answer those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis"},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>To be frank, it does not answer the matter of workforce planning.

The international benchmarking chapter on page 16 of the main report, which is useful, shows that we have a younger population and, therefore, currently, we should need less of everything in healthcare <i>per capita<\/i>, except perhaps maternity care.  According to the resourcing figures, which have been benchmarked against good healthcare systems such as Australia, Norway, Sweden and New Zealand - these are best in class and not OECD averages - we have approximately the same number of GPs, nurses and hospital beds <i>per capita<\/i>but we have a younger population and, therefore, we should need fewer.  At the same time, we are experiencing poor healthcare outcomes comparatively and the capacity review says that even today, a huge number of new beds are needed.  Those two outcomes do not intuitively tie together.  Will the witnesses explain why, if we need less <i>per capita<\/i>and technically we have more GPs, nurses and beds than we should need relative to some of the best healthcare systems in the world, the capacity review has found that we have much less than we need?

We have had trouble getting information on activities, for example, the number of operations performed in theatres, or basic information such as whether the theatre is open.  Where did the witnesses obtain the data?  To whom did they speak?  Where the resource data come from and to what do they refer?<\/p> <p>  The 2007 capacity review was undertaken by the witnesses' company.  According to that, there were 11,660 beds.  By 2016, this number had reduced to 10,500, which is a reduction of 1,160.  Where did all the beds go?  Are they in the system?  Are they on wards that are closed?  We did not experience significant hospital closures.  Where are those beds?  What hospitals are they in?  What type of beds are they?

It strikes me as odd that this will not be included and it is very worrying that workforce, skills mix and future planning are not part of it.  We do not just have an issue with recruitment and retention in our acute hospitals but have them across the board.  We also have an ageing GP population, which will further complicate matters.

We have modelled capacity to say what is required at CHO level and at hospital group level.  When one does a strategic capacity assessment, some of the specifics are going to get in the way and current performance is related to specifics to some extent.  The international direction of travel is towards population health management, which requires accountable care in the US, for example, and generally requires that, in planning delivery of services, one has a comprehensive view of the hospital, community and social care services which the population will receive so that one can make outcome-based decisions to put resources into different places, so that one gets the effect one wants.  A misalignment of populations has been clear in England recently.  Most of the rest of the UK has population health boundaries but England went away from this and, in the past two years, it has been struggling to realign the governance of the system so that hospitals, primary care and mental health organisations start talking about common populations.  We believe the same challenge will emerge in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  When we worked with the national clinical programmes in Tallaght, one of the issues we saw was the number of different organisations involved in discharges from the hospital, the number of different procedures for discharging and the number of discharge co-ordinators with whom the hospital had to work.  The more fragmented and complex the picture is, the more difficult it is for the system to achieve the level of patient care and the patient experience to which we aspire.  We have modelled capacity needs and there are implications, particularly in the third scenario, for how hospital groups work together and with their catchment areas, community health organisations etc.<\/p> <p>  We are not specifically modelling a scenario to reshape the CHOs so that they are all lined up as there are complex issues in doing that.  However, in getting systems to work together, there is a legal structure.  We need to ask if people are able to work together and can flex budgets.  Hearts and minds will be a factor and we need to ask if people will accept it if things go in different directions.  Certain specialties are delivered in some places and not in others and we have to ask if people will accept such changes in authority in the groups involved.  We agree with the Sl&aacute;intecare report that an alignment is, in principle, a good thing and other systems are, indeed, heading back in that direction.<\/p> <p>  We were asked about challenges we may not have foreseen in the area of future capacity.  We have to model what is sensible to model.  We have looked at challenges in what we call \"non-demographic growth\", which is a technical phrase for things that happen that do not involve people getting bigger and older.  For example, we looked at the trend in day cases and we found that it was a trend that would probably stop, rather than carry on.<\/p><p>There were factors associated with bed blocking, among other issues, which meant that hospitals were performing day cases as an alternative to some of the other surgeries they would probably have preferred to be doing at that time.  We have changed some of those trends.  We can pick up some of the non-demographic growth.  One would anticipate that, over time, medical technology will change, but I do not believe that it will change in a completely transformational way in the next ten to 15 years time.  There will be more personalised medicine on a relatively small scale which might have some implications for capacity at a very detailed level.  There may be a number of gene and cell therapy clean rooms, some wards, and things like that.  However, at this stage I do not believe, in terms of the level of detail we have provided and the parameters we have provided, that it is sensible to add in any other factor to do that.  That is a sensible basis for planning. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I would sound a note of caution on how we make those international comparisons.

We look at the different counting rules and definitions that different health systems will use for hospital beds or a GP, etc.  Behind these headline indicators there is a raft of other factors within the system that are driving this.  It is not the case that every country has exactly the same health system and that therefore it is possible to make like-for-like comparisons.

It means that people are going into acute settings that might have been seen in the community, or people who are going in for referrals to specialists who perhaps could have been seen by a physiotherapist.  We actually appear to have more clinical assets in the primary care settings and more clinical assets in the acute setting, so a lack of integration may suggest that we have people who are going into hospital who perhaps should be staying in the community.

In Ireland the performance in this area has been declining.

We have not looked specifically at that, but in other areas where we have looked at this question GPs operating alone tended to have different productivity outcomes to GPs working in larger teams where there is a degree of specialisation, for example women's services, diabetes and things like that within the GP community.  In particular, the nurse GP ratio could be looked at.  In New Zealand many general practice tasks are carried out by nurses, with issues escalated to doctors when appropriate.  Nurses are able to carry out many of these tasks.  My understanding is that the Department has put in place a programme for building primary care centres, but is having difficulty attracting GPs to relocate and work from those centres.  We believe that productivity within the system is hampered by some of these workforce factors.  It is also hampered by the lack of integration.  On a practical level, how many different forms have to be filled out and how many different people have to be contacted to move someone on?  That is affected by the fragmentation within the system at present.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland still has a long journey to take in terms of resourcing healthcare.  The way that budgets work does not encourage an output, let alone an outcome, review of what is being achieved.  It is very much an input-based strategy, and things will not change until that approach is altered.  I do not mean changes at a managerial level.  There is a very real sense among clinicians that they understand and own patient outcomes.  They know that the decisions they make every day not to discharge someone from an acute ward condemns someone to an extra stay on a trolley in an emergency department.  Those are risk-based decisions, and they are difficult, but that is the kind of real cultural change that is required across the system.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#L01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":529,"content":"<p>On the public health indicators, yes, Irish people have a long life expectancy, but if one looks at the figures we have on smoking and alcohol consumption it is a different picture.

The person has been discharged from hospital and is living alone.  All the person gets from the public health nurse is a telephone call and there is no follow-up checking.  The person is six weeks out of hospital and is in what I would consider to be a serious enough medical condition, but there is no co-ordination.  No one has written to the public health nurse saying the nurse should call to this person once every week.<\/p> <p>  The consultants have looked at other systems.

Did the consultants look at that in the context of delivering far more effective services by the co-ordination of services?<\/p> <p>  I have looked at the set-up in Canada, where GPs go into and work in hospitals.  Some might work two days per week or two half-days per week there.  That is the level of contact.

I hope I will not repeat some of the questions asked before.  If I do, let me know.  Productivity of the workforce was mentioned, as was primary care service being GP-heavy.  The consultants referred to single GPs operating on their own.  When it comes to the geographical situation in Ireland, this is an issue because we have remote parts with low population.  There is need for single GPs to service these communities.  Although I am all for the primary care centre, it simply will not work in certain parts of Ireland.  The consultants spoke to their experience rather than the report.  Has that been considered?<\/p> <p>  Attracting GPs to primary care centres seems to be an issue in Ireland.  We appear to have some good centres set up but getting GPs to come and work in what is a semi-corporate set-up is difficult.  It was always the case that it was integral to a GP's work that she was in charge of her practice and was almost a doctor and a business person in the same way as a pharmacist.  I am a pharmacist by profession.  Is that where PA Consulting Group believes the barrier is?  Is it a question of losing that autonomy?  Do the consultants have any views on that?<\/p> <p>  The consultants spoke about how in other countries nurses are upskilled to do certain jobs and GPs become more specialist.  Do the consultants have any view on the barriers to GPs letting go of certain bread-and-butter practices, for want of a better phrase, that are crucial to keeping a certain baseline revenue coming in to a practice?  I have in mind things like repeat prescriptions for contraceptives.  I firmly believe these can be done in the community pharmacy setting through the Oregon algorithm to make it safe to deal with contraceptive needs of women and men.<\/p> <p>  The consultants spoke about the current stock value.  Will they elaborate a little on the beds we have?  They spoke about isolation rooms.  Will they elaborate on that?  Is it the case that the stock we have is not primary stock?  We may have large numbers of eight-bed wards.  I take it from what the consultants have said that such a set-up might be counter-intuitive because if there is an eight-bed ward and disease is spreading, then it will compound the issue and we will have more admissions.<\/p> <p>  Senator Burke referred to the New Zealand model whereby the GPs go into the hospital.  I was at a hospital in Kilkenny looking at the system in operation there.  To my mind, the system operating there is the way forward.  It is not the solution but it is a partial solution.  It seems bizarre that a GP, who is the anchor to a patient's healthcare, would refer a patient to a hospital and then the patient goes into the same room as another who has broken his leg on the football pitch, even though the first patient has essentially already been triaged by the GP.<\/p> <p>  I imagine the consultants know that in Carlow and Kilkenny a community pharmacist is involved in the discharge process.<\/p><p>The service is more seamless and there are fewer errors.  Have the PA Consulting Group considered that?

I was listening to them in the office, although I was not physically present.  One of the issues that concerns me about the health service is the cost-benefit analysis that is done on the decisions that are made.  It is not obvious to me that the cost-benefit analysis on some of the decisions is correct.  This includes some of the decisions to close district hospital beds and so on and the impact that has in the short, medium and long term.  Is it possible for the HSE to supply to the committee secretariat or to members exactly what elements are used in the cost-benefit analysis?  That would help us to understand the decisions.  I do not have confidence in the cost-benefit analysis models that are being used, either to make decisions on the closure of beds or for centralisation of services.  I take the point made about the centralisation of services and the improved outcomes and I would certainly agree with that, but we need to see the sacrifices that are made for that in terms of access to health care services in rural areas and the importance of putting in place services at a local level where it is safe to do so.  We have not done that and have failed dismally to do that.<\/p> <p>  I take it from the accents of the witnesses that they would be very familiar with the NHS in the United Kingdom.  I know that Mr. Stevens was looking at the model of moving away from the centralisation and privatisation model and bringing it back to communities.  We have continued to talk about that for 20 years but we have not put actions behind the words.<\/p> <p>  I cite the most recent decision in respect of the withdrawal of the Versatis plasters from those who have a medical card.  I am not at all satisfied that there was a proper cost-benefit analysis done in reaching that decision, that affected 25,000 people, in terms of the extra hospitalisation, medicines and anti-depressants that were required.  Leaving aside the humanity of the decision, if we are looking at the impact of the decision economically, I do not believe the decision was correct.<\/p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to expand on the question of modelling and how we can have more transparency and accountability around the modelling and adoption of new drugs such as Translarna and the impact that would have.  How can Britain provide free GP care for 60 million people and we cannot do it for 5 million people?  As a person who lived in Britain for a long time and accessed that service, I cannot understand why we cannot do the same.  Will the witnesses give us three primary reasons why they think that we are failing to do the same here?<\/p> <p>  The document provided to us is good, but has the scenario of an all-island approach to the delivery of health care been considered?  In the timeframe 2000 to 2031, there is a growing realisation that we are working towards a united Ireland and an all island approach to services such as health care, education and so on.  It is imperative that those models are being worked out properly in the Department and the HSE, in particular that they would look at the impact of Brexit.

I do not believe that remark was intended in that way, but the remark could be construed by health service workers as being somewhat dismissive because clearly they are doing their best.  To clarify that remark, will the witnesses outline for us who from the health service workforce, outside of the people whom one would call the management, did they meet?  Did they talk to those on the front line of delivering the services about the challenges they are facing day in, day out, week in and week out, which are all resource dependent?

If a bed is used for one reason, and that is an extra day's stay in bed because somebody is not able to do a ward round, that bed is therefore not available to somebody else.  I agree wholeheartedly with members that the people I have met and talked to across the system want to deliver the best care possible.  Under pressure, they feel the bounds of their world are often much more limited than the whole hospital, so they hold on to beds so that their patients can get into those beds.  They are under pressure for other reasons so they are unable to do the ward rounds that would allow them to get people discharged faster.  There are all sorts of reasons at a human and a practical level.  When capacity is used in a way that looks like it is overused, and the trend of rising average length of stay in Ireland would suggest that, as a whole, the system is behaving in that way, that has an implication.  That is what I was saying.  I would say that.  I would also preface my comments that none of us is a clinician.  A number of the questions we have been asked are actually about clinical decisions, but we are able to look at the impact of clinical decisions system wide and comment on what the sum of those decisions means to the system and, in this context, specifically for capacity.

That means that the number of beds used for the same sorts of issues is higher than in other systems.  I was trying to understand why that is.  It is not because people in Ireland are physiologically different from people in other countries.  It is to do with the way the system works.  I will answer Deputy O'Connell's question while addressing Senator Colm Burke's and give some examples.  Some of this is about the integration of the system and the issues of engagement between hospitals and GPs and between GPs and practice nurses and so on.  We have looked at other systems.  I have worked in other systems, and not just the system of the country from which my accent comes.<\/p> <p>  In terms of returning people to the community out of hospital, in the US there was a behaviour at a system level to reduce the average length of stay continually, which resulted in people getting out of hospital too quickly.  Penalty tariffs were introduced.  In effect, the insurers would no longer pay for a readmission that happened after 30 days.  This had a significant impact in the US.  In England a similar tariff was introduced.  It has not had the same dramatic effect as it had in the US for other reasons, but there was a behavioural driver linked to resource which indicated that if work was given to be done in the community, resources were needed to do that work.  It is not a question of whether people are discharged early.  In the example the Senator gave of someone needing a call, that is extra work for someone's workload.  What is that person's caseload?  Can he or she do that?  Is the resource following the patient?  This is what we mean when we talk about population health.  We mean that when rational decisions are made which say that care is better delivered in community settings, it is not just a matter of getting everyone out of hospital.  The community providers have to be resourced.  We have to recognise that.  Another really good example from the UK was discharge summaries.  The community teams there were unable to do their job because they were not being informed by the hospitals in time.  Again, a system was introduced to get people out.  I think similar initiatives are being worked on in Ireland which will enable hospitals to get discharge summaries out to GPs as effectively.<\/p> <p>  This sort of integrated care involves quite difficult clinical governance issues.  I did some work in Scotland where the system has quite a different structure from that of England.  I was working in a surprisingly remote area.  I will not name it, but it had the equivalent of a model 3 hospital and several model 2 equivalent hospitals.  GPs had admitting rights to the model 2 hospitals.  It was found that people from remote rural communities were being sent to the model 3 hospital, often for diagnostic tests, and were being admitted to older wards and being held on to.  Why was this happening?  It was because the consultants in the hospitals did not think that the GPs would have the time or the facilities to look after the patients at risk properly.  They started to work on a different model of clinical governance whereby people could be stepped down into the model 2 equivalent hospitals while still under the consultant and in which there was an information system that allowed the consultant to keep an eye on the patient.  It was particularly used for cases of sepsis.  The sepsis teams were still able to give that service to the model 2 hospitals and the model 2 hospitals were a safe and effective place for patients to be.  Evidence was coming out that people who were returned to that type of model 2 hospital, which had community rooms and so on, actually returned home faster than if they had been recuperating in a ward in the model 3 fully acute hospital.  The hospitals worked on that model.  That is an example of how it is not just about providing the capacity or giving some good policy.  There is a lot of clinical governance and detailed work involved and the way that resources move around the system needs to work for this to work effectively in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":559,"content":"<p>On the cost-benefit analysis side, I cannot speak for what the HSE has used, but I can offer a view on the common factors we generally see health systems considering when they are involved in service change.  Such changes can range from very centralised surgery services down to more localised services such as the ones we have been involved in which have included the use of telecare or telehealth locally to help shift out care and different ways in which paramedics and ambulances can contribute to the system.  I would highlight six factors which generally come up.  The first is about quality.  Underneath that there are the clinical outcomes, the patient experience and patient safety.  What impact will a given change, be it a service change or a policy, procedural or regulatory change, have?  The second factor is access.  In the questions the committee has raised, we have spoken about what a change means for remote communities.  Some services need to be very local, others need clinical volumes to get good outcomes.  Another factor is the workforce.  We have discussed that.  Part of that workforce factor is the education and training requirements.  The junior doctors, trainee nurses and allied health professionals need to see the right amount of patients in order to train.  The productivity of a training establishment will be different and a system needs to reflect that.<\/p> <p>  The fifth factor relates to the financial side and the net present value.  However, that is, as the committee can see, one of six factors.  The final factor is deliverability.  We have spoken about the next steps and feasibility.  Whether it is a massive building programme or a big requirement to train up and create a workforce, how it will be delivered must be considered.  That is just at a national level but it is equally applicable at a local level if a GP-led health centre or a more local hospital is being set up.  It must be considered whether it can be practically delivered in terms of infrastructure, IT, estate, timing and such things.  Those are the six factors that repeatedly come up.  Then there will always be, depending on the level at which it is being done, particular local issues.  There may be a particular issue around health inequalities in a particular area which needs to be addressed.  This would mean that provision in that area would be designed slightly differently.  That would be our general view of the cost-benefit analysis but, as I have said, we cannot speak to exactly what the HSE would use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":560,"content":"<p>What is difficult to understand is how a cost-benefit analysis, CBA, in the North, which is just a few miles up the road, can deliver something like Versatis or Translarna while a CBA here can say that it is not viable.

Based on local populations, different decisions have been arrived at from those in England.  That is really a question on eligibility for the authorities here.  Looking at demand and capacity - which we are here to talk about - having clear thresholds is an important part of keeping a handle on demand and ensuring that the activity is correctly directed at those clinically most justified.  Other people will be held to account for those decisions.  Similarly, the issue of medical cards is outside the scope of anything we can comment on here.  A question was asked on medical cards.  That is a detail.  It would be for people to make a clear, clinical, economic and welfare judgment on the cases presented.  The two systems North and South are clearly very different.  However, they are both under huge pressures.  At a detailed level, perhaps they will be making different financial decisions, based on some of the choices in front of them.

I was there at the time of A Vision for Change.  I am led to believe that people can be waiting up to three weeks for a standard GP appointment.

There is a question as to whether that is done in a GP practice or whether that practice is part of a health centre or whether it is done by practice nurses, pharmacists or a whole range of professionals.  The NHS is looking at how one might disaggregate and define that care which is between what one historically would have thought of as default GP care and the referral to a consultant in a hospital.

Rather, it was keen to look within the Irish system at the length of stay.  It was benchmarked against best performance internally.  We looked at the median across all of the hospitals within age category and speciality.  We asked what would happen if everybody got to the median level?  For those at median, what would happen if we got to a 25th percentile?  The answer was there would be some improvement over five years.  That was felt by the steering group to be a reasonable improvement in length of stay.  It was not a case of saying let us get to the position in Finland or Australia.  It was to get to the best practice currently in Ireland.  It was likewise with levels of allied health professionals, AHPs, and CHOs.

I welcome quite a number of our members who are present in the Gallery, particularly representatives of ISME, Motorsport Ireland,  Playcentres Ireland, Ireland Active, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, RGDATA and the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland.   Their attendance here is a measure of the intensity with which they feel these issues and the way they affect their operations.<\/p> <p>  Members have already received a copy of our submission.  Therefore, I will not go through it all but will summarise its key points.  The Alliance for Insurance Reform brings together representative bodies from the not-for-profit charity, sports and small and medium size business sectors across Ireland, representing more than 35,000 organisations, more than 633,000 employees and more than 41,000 volunteers to demand rapid action to end crippling insurance costs.<\/p><p>The creation of the alliance is a response to countless stories from small organisations where services and jobs are being affected by excessive insurance premiums, both liability and motor.  Members will have heard many such stories, but there is a considerable fear among many organisations which are afraid to go public on their experiences because they are at the mercy of one underwriter or afraid to draw additional claims on themselves.  What members are hearing is only the tip of the iceberg.However, we will not focus on the stories but analysis and solutions. <br\/><br\/>Our approach to insurance in Ireland is at a turning point.  The system is dysfunctional to the extent that what is supposed to be a service industry that facilitates the operation of society has become an extractive industry, taking over &euro;2 billion in motor and liability insurance premiums annually.  It is protected and often made compulsory by the State and so expensive that it threatens the viability of many organisations that form the backbone of the nation. <br\/><br\/>A survey of 950 organisations within the alliance, carried out by Am&aacute;rach Research in January, found that since 2013, nearly half of respondents had seen their premiums rise by over 30%, while over one fifth had seen rises of over 70%.  This was in the broader context of a consumer price index increase of 0.9% in the same period.  Two thirds of respondents also reported having increased excesses or new exclusions added to their policies, an equally damaging trend that severely restricts the ability of organisations to develop and creates additional exposure to cost.  <br\/><br\/>Critically, 45% of respondents cited insurance as a threat to the future of their organisation, yet our members believe the insurance industry and the legal profession have the strongest voices in the corridors of power.  Policyholders believe we have no voice.  This is amplified by last week's Collins Institute report for Fine Gael which concluded that the Central Bank, the State institution charged with protecting insurance policyholders, was too focused on the needs of the financial services industry.  There is much activity in the area, but our concern is that a lot will be discussed and that little will be done as it is not in the interests of the insurance companies or lawyers operating in this market for anything to change.  If we were them, we would huff and puff in a show of empathy with our customers, but we would fight tooth and nail to stop real change.  We would cite issues arising from the Constitution, data protection or competition, suggest self-regulation, agree to protocols, ease off on aggressive profit-taking for a while until the fuss died down and string out the debate to the next general election; anything to stop real reform. <br\/><br\/>In the last six weeks we have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, and his officials, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Personal Injuries Commission, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and it is clear that many elements of the work of the cost of insurance working group are grinding to a halt, with the dead hand of vested interests evident.  The buck stops firmly with policymakers.  The actions we are suggesting are in the areas of prevention, consistency and transparency.  We believe them to be just, proportionate, feasible, achievable within a limited timeframe and, ultimately, effective.  The following are practical ways to solve the insurance crisis which we hope the committee will consider and support.<br\/><br\/>On prevention, to quote a member of the audience at a public meeting we held in Cork in February, &quot;If I had a need for big money and I had a choice between robbing a bank and faking an injury, I'd pick the fake injury every day.  More money and no consequences if I'm found out.&quot;  We absolutely acknowledge the right of genuine claimants to fair compensation, but people have accidents all over the world; it is the consequences for Irish policyholders that appear unique.  We are suggesting four actions in this area.  <br\/><br\/>First, we call for sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to be linked.  We want an amendment to the Act such that if a case is dismissed under section 26 because the plaintiff knowingly gives or adduces evidence that is false or misleading, it would automatically be<i><\/i>referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for prosecution under section 25, which would penalise such an offence with a substantial fine or imprisonment or both unless a defendant deliberately falsely accused a plaintiff of giving such evidence.  <br\/><br\/>Second, we seek the establishment of a Garda insurance fraud unit. <b><i><\/i><\/b>The cost of insurance working group's motor insurance reports promised a dedicated Garda unit to focus exclusively on the investigation of insurance fraud.  We want the unit to be established as a matter of urgency.  The Minister has told us that there is not enough support in the House for it.  If that is the case, we urge opposing parties to clarify their concerns and remove the blockages. <br\/><br\/>Third, we seek the regulation of claims management companies, also known as claims harvesters.  Our members tell us that claim harvesting websites are acting as the ambulance chasers of old, pursuing potential claimants with promises of money to be made, regardless of how dubious the claim and with no costs or consequences.  They are adding fuel to the fire of fraudulent, exaggerated and misleading claims and must be regulated by the State to protect policyholders and society as a whole.  In particular, referral fees they might charge to refer live cases to solicitors must be banned outright.  Regulation, registration and a ban on referral fees would only bring Ireland into line with the regime in place in the United Kingdom since 2007.  It is not sufficient for the Government to pass this onto the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which is still in the process of establishing itself.  Regulation must be brought forward now. <br\/><br\/>Fourth, we want sections 7 and 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to be amended.  First, in section 7, we call for the period in respect of the Statute of Limitations on personal injury claims to be reduced from two years to one year.  As the average period for a claim to be registered with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board following an accident is nine and a half months, this would not disadvantage claimants.  Second, the language used in section 8 which purports to oblige a plaintiff to inform a defendant of an incident within two months is so conditional as to be useless and ignored in our experience.  We ask that it be tightened in order that judges would have to take into account any delay in notification before allowing a case to proceed.  The Department of Finance has stated it is pursuing this issue with the Department of Justice and Equality, but we want it done urgently.<br\/><br\/>On consistency, the general damages awarded in Ireland for minor injuries bear no relation to those awarded in other countries, which makes Ireland a very attractive place to have a minor accident.  Furthermore, there is no consistency within the jurisdiction in awards for identical injuries, which makes it very attractive in personal injury cases to reject a PIAB offer and head for the courts, safe in the knowledge that with the right judge, the rewards may be substantially better.  We seek two reforms in this area, the first of which is that the approach to calculating the book of quantum be changed.  The Court of Appeal has established that the ceiling on general damages for catastrophic injuries is &euro;450,000.  It has also established that the concepts of common sense and proportionality are central to the principles of proper compensation.  We call for a revised book of quantum calculated on that percentage disability basis as a matter of urgency through the Personal Injuries Commission which is only looking at solutions in the case of motor whiplash claims.  The Government should extend its remit to all injuries immediately.  Next we encourage consistency among the judiciary.<b><i><\/i><\/b>The 2004 Civil Liability and Courts Act should be amended to require judges who award damages in excess of the book of quantum for general damages to set out a detailed reasoning for so doing.<br\/><br\/>On transparency, the insurance industry is of systemic importance to the proper functioning of Irish society and enshrined as such in much legislation and regulations, yet there is virtually no transparency in the market, either at industry or individual policyholder level.  We demand that control of analysis and reporting of the new national claims information database be given to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, rather than the Central Bank, as envisaged by the cost of insurance working group.  The PIAB has the expertise and funding necessary and no additional legislation would be required as sections 54 and 55 of the PIAB Act of 2003 already allow for this function.  We ask that the blue book be reinstated immediately and enhanced in order to restore the only transparency there was in the market before the Central Bank discontinued it in 2016.  <br\/><br\/>We want to scrap and revisit the agreed large increases protocol.  The very first recommendation in the report of the cost of insurance working group on motor insurance was that insurers set out for customers the reasons for large increases in premiums.<\/p><p>The protocol produced from this recommendation was one of the first actions to be ticked as completed in the CIWG updates.  However, the protocol agreed between the Department of Finance and the insurance industry which I have linked with the submission is a good example of how the cost of insurance working group is being strangled.  We would be better off without it as it only creates the impression that something has been achieved when it has not.  We want a meaningful protocol agreed to for both motor and liability insurance policyholders that individualises explanations, with clear calculations showing the basis of premium charges.<\/p><p> We seek the reinstatement of the 2003 insurance industry-IBEC protocol for dealing with claims.  Almost one year was spent by the Department of Finance and Insurance Ireland talking in circles about a protocol for notifying policyholders about the progress of claims against them before the Department discovered a pre-existing protocol agreed to by Insurance Ireland's predecessor, the IIF, and IBEC in 2003.  The insurance industry is resisting it being implemented anew.  We demand that it be implemented immediately, backed by legislation, for both the motor insurance and liability insurance sectors.  A copy of the protocol is attached in Appendix 3.<\/p><p> As an alliance, we have put a great deal of work into addressing this crucial issue for our members and their employees and volunteers.  We hope the committee can help us in ensuring action.

Because of the increased costs, the organisation has had to cut services and reduce its workforce.  It is paying more for insurance cover than for petrol.  It has had a big impact on services.  From the perspective of charitable organisations that have to raise funds to pay additional insurance costs, it is a big challenge to fundraise for services without being lumped with this additional overhead.

It has a prudential role which always seems to receive priority and a consumer protection role which appears to be ignored.  As one of the Deputy's colleagues said at a meeting of another committee a few weeks ago, the bank is a dog that does not bark, never mind bite when it comes to customer protection.  We would strenuously object to the bank taking on that role.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the information not being supplied, the simplest reform the Government could implement is to tell the Cental Bank to reinstate the blue book.  The blue book was a set of industry data which, while not perfect, gave an overview of what was going on in the industry and a sense of profitability.  Profitability is complex in the insurance industry and can only be interpreted over a number of years, if not a decade, because of claim trends and other issues.  However, the blue book provided clarity, but the Central Bank summarily cut it and 2015 is that last year for which data are available.  The blue book has been replaced by a set of Solvency II data which are unintelligible, even to actuaries, and of no use from a consumer point of view.  From claims up, all of the data are available.  The PIAB collects the data constantly because all claims must initially go to it.  It is a matter of collating the data and reporting on them, as the PIAB is well placed to do so.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the question about the three actions the Government should take.  The actions we have suggested are granular and defined enough to be acted on because there are different people who could act on each.  If the Deputy wanted something to be done before close of play this evening, I suggest the establishment of a Garda insurance fraud unit.  Garda&iacute; had reached the stage where they had met their colleagues in the United Kingdom where they looked at a similar unit, but that initiative seems to have shuddered to a halt<\/p><p>Everybody is in agreement that it makes sense so we are not entirely sure why it has shuddered to a halt.  That would be number one.<\/p><p> Number two would be asking the Judiciary to express why judges are going beyond the book of quantum in the context of general damages.  I want to emphasise here that we are always looking at protecting the plaintiff on this, so we are not talking about special damages, which are for loss of earnings or other expenses.  We are talking about very specific general damages which apply in cases of injury.  They are measured in the book of quantum but they are constantly being overruled in the courts.  We cannot and do not want to interfere with the role of the Judiciary in this country but we want an explanation when the book of quantum is breached.<\/p><p> The Insurance Ireland-IBEC protocol on dealing with claims is absolutely dogging the entire small and medium enterprise sector at the moment.  Ms Reid will probably say the same in a moment.  I refer to claims are being settled without any consultation with policyholders.  It is a matter of natural justice and it is creating a fog in this area, which makes it very difficult to find out what is going on because there is so little transparency on the part of the insurance companies.  The protocol is there.  It has been properly parsed and written.  I assume it has been legally vetted because it was signed off and agreed by Insurance Ireland's predecessor in 2003.  It is just a matter of them getting off their asses, if members will excuse my expression, and implementing it again because nothing has changed between then and now that might bar us from using it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524054600,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I will return to the issue of transparency for a moment.

The most recent incident I had was a claim back in 2011 when a number of false allegations were made and on the day the matter was contested, it was discovered that the allegations were false.  I believed the case had gone away until recently when I received a letter from a solicitor who allegedly acted on my behalf and, to my shock, he was looking for payment for that.

It was good to listen to their presentation.  I congratulate them on setting up the group and on coming before us to engage in respect of this issue.  When one is trying to run a business, one has enough things to do in terms of one's shopfront or backyard without having to lobby or advocate for changes in legislation.  I understand that the frustration they experienced led the witnesses to this point.  The same is true of those in the Gallery.  I read with interest about the number of stakeholders and component groups involved in the alliance; it is quite a significant body that is represented.  It great to have the group before us.<\/p> <p>  The points addressed in the presentation all appear to be very sound and reasonable.  Is it a ten-point plan?  I hope we can progress the points in some shape or form, either at the committee or in the Houses, because they make a lot of sense.<\/p> <p>  I wish to inquire about a couple of matters.  Reference was made - I have read details of this elsewhere - to sums being paid out in respect of minor injuries and other incidents without being challenged and even without the knowledge of policyholders.  Ms Reid spoke about such a case.  People representing businesses and employment agencies have come to see me at my constituency office to discuss workplace accidents whereby an employee is allegedly injured and when a claim comes in the insurer often settles it without contesting matters or ascertaining the details of who did what.  Employers often say that claims are trumped up and that they did not get their day in court or anywhere else - such as at an employment tribunal or other forum - in order that they could trash matters out.  They often say that if they were given the choice, they would have fought it tooth and nail.  However, they do not get a choice because their insurers just pay out and if they query the matter, the insurer says that is the way it is and there is nothing to do about it but pay the premium the following year.  Insurers say that is how they do business.  That is extremely frustrating.  Business owners have come to me with such cases and I will be interested to hear the experience of the witnesses in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps that comes under the point relating to the claims management companies.  I have heard from people locally that there are websites and hotlines - offered through the medium of a variety of languages - people can ring in order to report accidents at work and the companies involved will chase the claims on their behalf.  Such companies encourage or vet the process, which is unhelpful to say the least to the premium payer.<\/p> <p>  My final point correlates to all that I have just said.  I noticed that much of the documentation provided refers to rising legal costs.  I appreciate that this is a factor.  I will put my hand up and say that I am a lawyer, but I do not speak for the legal industry - far from it.  I am not practising at present but I hear from colleagues.  Does the issue go back to insurers?  I am interested to find out if the supposition is correct that the lawyers are creaming it and that legal costs are driving up costs overall.  Colleagues who are practising tell me that since the PIAB was set up and insurers began to do the work in-house, there is very little work for them because there is not much litigation in view of the fact that many cases do not go to trial.  Barristers find that they are not weighed down with injury cases coming their way.  In fact, they say it is all going to PIAB or what is increasingly more common is that insurers say they will settle and that is the end of the story.  That seems to be the big problem, namely, the lack of counter challenge whether it is in the courts or through an employer having his or her say or having some forum that can hear both sides of the case.  The question is how it is even cost effective for the insurers to be doing that.  Perhaps the answer is that they are ripping off the person who pays the premium and that is how it is cost effective, but it just seems that if that challenge was there it might be one solution to the problem.  I would be interested to hear the views of witnesses on what I have said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#E00400","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I will have a stab at responding to that question if I may.  Reference was made to the prevention of claims but in fact the PIAB only handles 10% of the claims and something like 20% of them make it to court.  I might not be correct in my statistics but up to 80% of cases are settled in between.  In my personal case my understanding is that insurance companies are reluctant to defend, first, because of the costs of defending cases.  We raised that under the heading of consistency.  When cases go to court the judgments seem to be quite random.  There seems to be a lack of consistency in judgments.  Again, insurance companies are very reluctant to go to court because it costs so much.  That is one of the reasons they push for settlements.  That is what happened in our case, whereby the insurer pushed to settle rather than defending.  Even though the company felt there was a case to defend it was very reluctant to go to court because of the costs.<\/p> <p>  The other issue in addition to prevention is that when a case gets to court even if the insurer wins the case it is very rare that the costs will follow the plaintiff.  It is generally defendants who seem to have the costs awarded to them.  Again, it is one of the reasons we said we would really like to see a change.  I am sorry if I am getting my sections mixed up but I think it is in section 26 that where a judge dismisses a case, it is just dismissed but nothing happens and the person walks away.  That is why we are looking for an automatic referral under section 25 that the Garda would get involved and there would be a prosecution.  We have to start preventing such claims.  If someone hurts himself or herself on my premises, I, as a businessman, want to look after that person but I am afraid to do anything because he or she could claim for &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000 for hurting a finger.  It is bizarre because the cost of the claim could be relatively small.  When one starts to add in all the costs, however, it gets out of control and that is reflected in my premium.  The system is very dysfunctional and, as a layperson, it is very hard to understand what is going on.  We certainly need to prevent those kind of small, misleading - not necessarily fraudulent - but exaggerated claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin McCambridge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":605,"content":"<p>If I could add to that, I had a discussion with an acquaintance in the legal profession last night about this whole area.  I understand the reluctance of insurance companies to go to court because it is a bit of a lottery.  That is not to be sympathetic to them in any way, shape or form because they have a lot to answer for in this area, but it is certainly the case that the gentleman I had the discussion with could only think of one case in recent case law where anybody was prosecuted under section 25 of the Civil Liability Act, and that was back in 2012.<\/p><p>The legislation is there but the way in which it is structured does not act as a deterrent for people who are intent on making exaggerated or misleading claims.<\/p><p> Going back to Deputy Lawless's comments on the issue of legal costs, we have not focused on legal costs to any great extent because we do not want this to turn into a blame game.  To be honest, we have felt that much of the debate on this in recent years has been very unsophisticated in that the vested interests take a position and point their guns at the opposition.  There has, between the legal profession and the insurance companies in particular, been a lot of \"It's your fault.  No, it's your fault.\"  We say that everyone involved in this, particularly those making money out of it, have a responsibility to address it.  What is different now is that it is unsustainable.  Businesses, charities and voluntary groups were able to handle the increases for a number of years, but it has gone past that point now and we are looking at a much broader issue.  This is why we are not a business-based organisation any more, because this is a societal threat.  The consequences of what is happening at present are that schools will not be able to allow kids to exercise in the schoolyards, it will not be possible to build additional community playgrounds, Montessoris will have to close because of the excesses and conditions on them, voluntary clubs will be restricted in what they can do, charities will not be able to provide the services they have been able to provide and society as a whole will shrink.  That is what we are looking at.  We want to avoid this bashing back and forth and actually get some action because we fear that an awful lot of what is being done at present consists of long-term processes aimed at solving an urgent problem, and that is of no use to our members.  That is why the ten items we have listed, we feel, can be addressed before the summer recess, never mind by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I wish to add a word of support to that.

Mr. Boland said that only one or two referred prosecutions have taken place under section 25 of the same Act.  In the context of the next appointee, the Alliance for Insurance Reform recommends the establishment of a Garda insurance fraud unit.  Mr. Boland said, \"The Minister has told us that there is not enough support in the House for this.\"  It was a recommendation of the group.  What I am trying to get at is why there is not enough support.  How have we tested that support, just as a matter of interest?  I am new to this committee; I had spent the past seven years on another committee.  Why is there no support?  Was there a motion before the House?  Was there a debate in the D&aacute;il?

There is no doubt but that there are huge sums at stake here in the context of the legal profession, the insurance companies and other vested interests.  That is a fact.  The Central Bank, of course, is a prudential overseer of the insurance market and has a prudential obligation to ensure that we have a functioning insurance market.

In the longer term, there is definitely a case for a separate body to oversee all of the financial sector in terms of consumer advocacy.

We are all involved in small businesses and small enterprises and we are not great fans of additional oversight and bureaucracy.  However, we cannot understand how the Central Bank can have that prudential role and a consumer protection role at the same time.  They are mutually exclusive.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the lack of support, I think three of us who are here today were at that meeting with the Minister.  We were told there was a lack of support for the proposal.  It was not clarified on what basis that support was lacking, but we were told there was a lack of support.  We were very disappointed by that because everything we had read from the cost of insurance working group would have suggested that everyone was gung ho on the idea and that it was going forward.  However, it seems to have been parked for now and we would be very anxious to get it back in place.  Regarding costs, it had already been agreed by Insurance Ireland that it would fund that unit, so the cost to the taxpayer would have been negligible.<\/p> <p>  As we understand it, and according to my legal contact last night, we can find only one case of a prosecution under section 25.  Regarding section 26, I know there are numbers in the cost of insurance working group report.  Up to this year, I think, it has been very low, certainly in the low teens, as I understand it, but we have seen an acceleration in the number of cases being dismissed under section 26 in recent months, and there have been headlines about that in the newspapers.  The one thing we cannot get over is that someone who has been found by the court to make a misleading or exaggerated claim - and often that is putting it politely - is then able to walk out of court scot-free, with no consequences, and in a position to do something similar again some time down the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1524054600,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Copy that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#F01300","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1524054600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I reiterate that Deputy Neville was very keen to be here today for this but he is also Fine Gael's lead speaker on mental health and is on the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, so there has been a clash.  He was here for the quorum at the start of the meeting to enable it to begin.  I just wanted to put that on the record because, like Deputy Quinlivan said, this is an area in which Deputy Neville is particularly interested.  I am also very interested in it because being a GP means running a small business, and owning a shopping centre has all the problems the witnesses have outlined.  However, I am very interested in it from the point of view of the consumer and the Government.  I really welcome the witnesses, the presentations they have made and the document they have given us because they have very clear, concise, reasonable suggestions, some of which I wish to discuss with them because I want to see what the blockage is.<\/p> <p>  I have heard very clearly what they have said and I agree with them 100%: where vexations complaints are made, there must be consequences for those who go beyond vexatious to fraudulent, and let us call a spade a spade.  We want to ensure that any citizen who is injured and is entitled to compensation gets it, but it should be reasonable and proportionate.<\/p><p>The comments regarding putting in place legislation that would put an onus on members of the Judiciary to explain the reason they have departed from the book of quantum in terms of an award make perfect sense and I hope they would not see issue with that.  Nobody wants to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary or the individual case because all cases are different but, at the same time, an explanation would be welcome.<\/p><p> I refer to some of the comments made.  The witnesses have given us some anecdotes, including Mr. McCambridge of McCambridge's in Galway, with which I am very familiar, my wife being from Galway, but they are anecdotes.  It would be very useful if there was some study done that gave evidence to the fact that X number have not been able to expand and Y number of jobs have been lost.  On many occasions in the voluntary sector, I have seen people who have not been able to set up facilities, perform a service or even run an event because of insurance costs.  There is no question about that.  I welcome, and I will continue to say this, that the witnesses have given us some clear suggestions.  The suggestion on the Garda fraud unit makes absolute sense to me.  There must be consequences for those who commit fraud.  <\/p><p> I do not know what issues we will face in terms of whether there should be an automatic referral between section 26 and section 25 but nonetheless we must explore that to identify the problems.<\/p><p> I want to discuss regulation of the claims management companies.  Mr. Boland stated this had been done in the United Kingdom in 2007.  Have the witnesses been given a rationale for the absence of such regulation?  Have they been told the reason we do not have such regulation or what the blockages are in that respect?<\/p><p> Regarding the legal costs, there is no doubt, as the witnesses have acknowledged, that very often insurers will not go to court because it is cheaper to settle the claim.  That is a problem but it possibly would not be as much of a problem if there was a consequence for those who made false claims.  The insurance company could then set about clarifying what happens to people when they do make false claims.  As a doctor, I see the other side of this in my surgery with people who have been injured but I have also had experiences, and I am not getting into the blame game, of where I have been instructed by \"the lawyer\" representing the client to refer them to a particular consultant, which I will always put in the report because I do not believe that is appropriate.  It is a particular problem for cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities also.  We want children to play in a normal environment outside, get dirty and allow them graze their knees.  That is the reality of life and to put in place anything that would block that seems detrimental to me.<\/p><p> All I ask of the witnesses is for them to identify the problems as to the reason the blue book has not been reinstated, particularly the 2003 IBEC-IIF protocol.  Have they had discussions with the Minister or the Department on that and, if so, what has been their response as to the reason that has not happened?  I will be very supportive of many of the issues the witnesses have raised today and will pursue them with the Ministers and the Departments relevant to them.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses have any thoughts on the need to have a policyholder advocacy office, as raised by Deputy Kelleher, in terms of consumer protection in the future?  We all know this is a dynamic area and as soon as we solve one lot of problems, another lot will present themselves.  It is the idea of who might be appropriate for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#F01400","speaker":"1421","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I will deal with the IBEC-IIF protocol.  The cost of insurance working group, CIWG, report is written in very parliamentary or diplomatic language, for want of a better word, but I get the impression from reading it that there was quite a bit of frustration in the Department of Finance when it turned out that a protocol already existed which had not been brought to its attention during the initial work on the cost of insurance working group.  It appears now from the fourth quarterly update that the insurance industry is saying that that protocol does exist but it has been superseded by the Central Bank's consumer guidelines.  We have had a good look at the Central Bank consumer guidelines and, to be honest, the contrast is like saying that one no longer needs a driver licence because one has a new membership card for Xtra-Vision.  They are completely separate.  It is completely inappropriate and there is no connection between the two.  The suggestion that the Central Bank guidelines could replace a detailed protocol like the one we have put into our submission is almost farcical.  There is some strong resistance in that regard, but it is only from one side of the coin.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Senator Reilly's question on the blue book, we were told at that meeting that the Central Bank is independent.  The Central Bank made that decision, and that is its decision.  As we have outlined, we are not specialists in this area but if the Central Bank has any role in terms of protecting the consumer, it needs to get with the programme and bring the blue book back as the bare minimum in terms of oversight of the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Regarding claims management, we spoke about that with the Minister.

There is no effective legislation in place to punish these sites.

I have got almost an unhealthy interest now in looking at the newspaper headlines every Thursday and Friday to see what has happened in court cases.  As a lay person reading through the judgments, one tries to work out how the judges arrived at their conclusions and sometimes it is very difficult to do that.  They may well have perfectly valid reasons and we believe if we could see those we would understand better the reason premiums are increasing or what we can do to prevent these issues but as a lay person reading the newspaper, I am not getting a clear picture as to the reason vast amounts of money are being awarded in these cases.  There is no downside to taking a case at present.  If it is thrown out, it is thrown out but nothing happens following it so unless we address these issues I believe the number will grow.

We have not put a timeframe on the meeting.  In the context of the previous item, it was my hope I would be in a position to attend the D&aacute;il Chamber for Leaders' Questions.  Oftentimes there are justice issues when I would like to be near the Taoiseach who in such cases likes to have me near at hand.  I am, however, in the hands of the committee.<\/p> <p>  The justice Vote group is made up of six Votes with in 2018 a combined gross expenditure allocation of &euro;2.58 billion - &euro;2.43 billion in current expenditure and &euro;144 million in capital expenditure.  In addition, there is a further capital provision of &euro;17.9 million in unspent capital from 2017 available for spending in 2018 under the capital carryover provisions.<\/p> <p>  By way of information for committee members, there were eight votes in the justice Vote group in 2017.  However, arising from a decision of the Government, responsibility for the Votes for the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland, all of which were previously part of the Justice and Equality Vote group, was transferred to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2018.  These are constituent bodies which will eventually merge to form T&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  The gross expenditure Estimate for the Garda Vote - Vote 20 - is &euro;1.650 billion which amounts to 64% of the funding for the entire Vote group.  The Estimate for 2018 is increased further by an additional amount of &euro;8.9 million carried forward from 2017 under the capital carryover provisions.  The high proportion of resources again allocated to the Garda Vote in 2018 underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the State, maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance for citizens and deter crime.  <\/p> <p>  In July 2016 the Government agreed an overall vision for the Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Taking account of retirements, Garda numbers increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017.  This represented a net increase of more than 600 since the end of 2016.  In addition, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, 200 of whom attested over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day weekend.  This will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.  A further 800 new Garda recruits will also enter the Garda College this year.  I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to increase, with the numbers at the end of 2017 showing more civilians working in the organisation than in each of the previous seven years.  Funding for a further 500 additional civilians is provided in the 2018 Estimate.  In that context, I expect the process of civilianisation to accelerate this year.<\/p> <p>  In addition to staffing resources, significant investment continues to be made in other areas of the Garda Vote.  I am particularly pleased that an additional &euro;157 million in capital investment was secured for the justice sector following the mid-term review of the Government&rsquo;s capital plan for the period 2016 to 2021, a significant proportion of which relates to the Garda Vote.  This level of funding is reflected in the national development plan that was published recently.  The plan provides for significant continuing investment in Garda capital funding in the next ten years, including ICT as a central component of the Garda modernisation and renewal programme; the Garda building and refurbishment programme; development of Garda training facilities; and continuing investment in the Garda fleet.  In 2018 the ICT and telecommunications budget is &euro;40 million.  There is a further &euro;5 million available for expenditure on the transport fleet and almost &euro;25.6 million in the Garda capital building and refurbishment programme.  The total Garda capital expenditure budget in the period 2018 to 2021 is in the region of &euro;400 million.<\/p> <p>  With these unprecedented levels of investment come responsibilities and deliverables and the resources are intrinsically linked with the modernisation and renewal programme which is the vehicle for implementation of the agreed recommendations made in the Garda Inspectorate's report Changing Policing in Ireland and the commitments given in A Programme for a Partnership Government aimed at increasing the visibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Members will be aware that the Policing Authority is overseeing implementation of the recommendations and reports on a quarterly basis.  To date, it has submitted four reports which have been published.  As evidenced in the reports, good progress is being made in a number of areas, with more to be done on a number of the other recommendations made.  A prioritisation exercise under way is an effective strategy.  In that context, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acknowledges that there are key recommendations that, if implemented, will have the capacity to leverage significant change in the organisation.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that positive progress has been made in embedding the code of ethics throughout the force.  Also, the divisional model of policing will shortly be rolled out on a pilot basis in four divisions.  Under this model, responsibilities will be allocated on a functional, rather than a geographical, basis, subject to modifications, to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in large rural divisions.  The Commissioner has selected the four divisions - the Dublin metropolitan region south central, Cork city, Galway and Mayo - for the pilot scheme in order to provide a mix of urban and rural policing environments.  Members will also be aware that the Independent Commission on the Future of Policing commenced work in May 2017.  It is due to report in September.  It is consulting widely in the course of its work, including with the public and civic society and other bodies or individuals it considers appropriate, including all of the major stakeholders.  It also held a meeting with Members of the Houses, with a strong cross-party attendance.  I acknowledge the contribution of members of the committee in that regard.  The commission issued a request for submissions on all aspects of its terms of reference.  It has also held public meetings in a number of venues across the State, including Dublin, Cork, Donegal, Waterford, Athlone and Limerick, among others.  Commission members have visited urban and rural Garda stations in a number of counties and also undertaken study visits in Ireland, Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the United States of America.  I look forward to receiving the output of this extensive body of work later this year.<\/p> <p>  Vote 24 - Justice and Equality - has a gross Estimate provision of just under &euro;444 million and is broken down into five separate programmes comprising almost 60 separate subheads reflecting the Department&rsquo;s strategy.  Programme A is leadership in and oversight of justice and equality policy and delivery.  It includes areas such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, both of which are important bodies in the deliberations of the committee.  An additional &euro;4 million is being provided for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, bringing the total budget to almost &euro;11.7 million in 2018.  The increased budget is reflective of the additional staffing and other resource requirements of the office in view of the fundamental transformation of the data protection environment arising from implementation of the general data protection regulation this year.<\/p><p>The increased funding fully reflects the importance of a stable and effective data protection regulatory environment in terms of the personal data of individuals but also in relation to the broader economy and in particular the continuing expansion and growth of the digital technology sector.  It was also possible to provide an additional &euro;300,000 to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to strengthen staffing resources including a new unit established on protected disclosures.  The resource requirements will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p> Programme B, a safe and secure Ireland, includes funding for front-line support services and agencies such as Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, the Probation Service, and Services to Victims of Crime, Cosc and State Pathology.  I am pleased that the building of a new forensic science lab on a site at Backweston in County Kildare will proceed this year.  Site enabling and other preparatory works commenced this year.  A total of &euro;9 million is being provided this year, with significant funding capital provided in the capital plan to complete the construction over the next couple of years.  Forensic Science Ireland makes a most significant expert contribution to the criminal justice system.  Funding to continue to develop the new facility is most important.  Not only will this provide a state-of-the-art facility to enable FSI to provide a much improved service in analysing samples submitted from crime scenes, providing expert witness in criminal trials, but also it will facilitate the merger of FSI with the Garda Technical Bureau.<\/p><p> Programme C, access to justice, includes the provision for the Legal Aid Board, the coroner service and the costs associated with commissions and special inquires.<\/p><p> Programme D, an equal and inclusive society, provides for funding for the Office of Migrant Integration as well as provision for Traveller initiatives, gender equality, disability awareness and social inclusion measures across a wide spectrum of areas.  The Estimate for 2018 includes a provision of &euro;3 million for the Decision Support Service under the aegis of the Mental Health Commission.  This funding will facilitate the implementation of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The role of the Decision Support Service is to support decision making by and for adults experiencing capacity difficulties.<\/p><p> Programme E, an efficient responsive and fair immigration, asylum and citizenship system.  This mainly includes funding for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and asylum seekers accommodation.  Additional funding this year of &euro;4 million is provided to establish the new passenger information unit, the primary role of which is to protect the safety and security of individuals through the prevention and detection of terrorist offences and serious crime.  Turning to the prison's Vote, Vote 21, the current estimate in 2018 is for &euro;341 million plus an additional &euro;2.23 million in unspent capital from last year.  The funding this year includes the provision for the financing of a step-down facility for women prisoners in the Dublin area.  It will accommodate women for a period of time following custody or on probation supervision who are assessed as suitable to reside in the community and have accommodation or other needs which require support.  The prison's capital budget over the period 2018 to 2021 will be in the region of &euro;120 million.  It will enable construction of the new wing in Limerick Prison as well as the improvement of facilities in Portlaoise and other prisons including the development of a masterplan for the Mountjoy campus aimed at centralising and enhancing shared services on that site.  A total Estimate in gross terms of &euro;132 million is being provided for the Courts Service, Vote 22, plus an additional &euro;6 million in unspent capital from last year.  The unspent capital from last year mainly relates to payments in respect of the regional public private partnership projects, PPPs, including a VAT payment to the Revenue Commissioners which did not fall due until this year.  The estimate for this year includes &euro;55 million in capital funding, including the carryover amount, mainly relating to the repayments in related to projects delivered under the PPP, mechanism but also including continuing investment in information and communications technology, ICT.  An additional &euro;5 million in ICT investment is being made available over the period 2019 to 2021 for enhanced courtroom technology to assist the efficient running of the courts as well as facilitating increased collaboration within the justice sector in criminal matters and the development in data sharing between agencies across the justice system.  A gross Estimate of &euro;3.34 million has been provided for the Policing Authority, Vote 41, which includes an increase of &euro;600,000 compared with 2017 to provide for additional staffing, accommodation and other costs associated with the important work of the Policing Authority.  The gross expenditure budget for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, Vote 25, is &euro;6.7 million to enable it to continue its important work in promoting and protecting human rights and equality.  In conclusion, a Chathaoirligh, that is a synopsis of the very broad justice sector group which I have given and I would be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#C00900","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat a Aire.

I have two questions on this Vote.  I refer to Garda pay and numbers in a general sense.  It has been indicated that the 2021 target is 15,000 sworn members of the Garda.  It is not terribly far off that or it will not be at the end of this year by my understanding.  Having said that, from my conversations with garda&iacute; in Cork and I am sure it is the case elsewhere, what seems to be happening is that with the very welcome establishment of specialist units, an awful lot of experienced garda&iacute; are being drawn away from core units and into specialist units, with the effect that a lot of the core units are still where they were in 2009 or 2010, even at this stage, with the additional recruits.  There are still more or less the same numbers in core units.  I ask the Minister in that context if he believes that the 2021 target for sworn members of the Garda should be revised to try to ensure that the core units that are serving communities, that are visible in communities, are at an adequate level.  An awful lot of the spare capacity is indirectly going into the specialist units.  I do not necessarily have a problem with that.  A lot of those are very valuable, particularly the protective unit, but it does mean that sergeants are struggling, even at this stage, to make sure that the garda&iacute; are visible in their communities.  It is not just rural areas, there are areas of big population where there could be just two cars between two stations and they are stretched between areas of big population.<\/p> <p>  The other question I have is on the administration subhead 5, office equipment and external IT services.  There was a reduction of 3%.  I am not sure if that is the exact subhead that is relevant.  I ask the Minister in a general sense whether it relates to that head or not.  The national development plan makes reference to ICT being a central component of Garda modernisation and renewal.  We have heard for years and years about the inadequacy of PULSE.  It has manifested itself across a wide range of areas in terms of poor data or data being inputted incorrectly and the implications that has.  That was broader than PULSE but PULSE is a factor here and it is vitally important that it is completely overhauled and replaced.  I want to know what commitment has been made to the IT upgrade in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2018, or whether that is reflected in that subhead and if that is a 3% reduction in the relevant subhead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#D00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":657,"content":"<p>In respect of Garda numbers, I accept what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said in so far as we are moving rapidly towards the year 2021 and the ambitious targets for Garda recruitment.  I am quite satisfied that these numbers will continue to grow until we have the overall Garda force of 15,000 sworn members by 2021, ably assisted by 4,000 civilians and 2,000 reservists, bringing a total complement of 21,000.  I note the point Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire makes about experience being drawn to specialist units.  I acknowledge the important of the Garda reform and modernisation programme.  As Minister, I will not interfere in this programme.<\/p><p>The Garda and the Policing Authority are best placed, in that they have the expertise to deal with the issue.  I am pleased at the level of expertise involved in the specialist units to which the Deputy referred.<\/p><p> Of the current intake of 800 recruits annually, just over 200 attested over the St. Patrick's Day weekend.  All of these fully attested probationary trainee garda&iacute; are in the service of the State at stations throughout the country.  In the context of those 800 recruits annually, we provide for 250 to 300 retirements, which leaves a net intake of over 500 garda&iacute;.  I do not intend to review that figure but I am anxious to ensure I am in a position to pledge resources to allow this state of affairs to continue in a way that was not the case during the years of difficult economic challenge.  My aim for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to ensure visibility and availability.  I meet regularly with the acting Garda Commissioner and senior garda&iacute; to discuss these issues and it is my aim to ensure these Government targets are met.<\/p><p> I note the Deputy's interest in what he might describe as \"core units\" of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a period during which new recruits are probationers working for the most part in larger stations.  They go through that period of 18 months prior to being stationed around the country.  This is positive.  As the committee is anxious to ensure its input, advice and guidance are appreciated fully, I am happy at all times to convey its concerns and priorities directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself or to bodies such as the Policing Authority.<\/p><p> In respect of IT services, I accept there have been shortcomings and that there is a need to ensure ICT at the best possible level is available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Capital spending of &euro;40 million is available in 2018 increasing to &euro;60 million, &euro;83 million and &euro;63 million over the years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.  That is in accordance with the phasing of projects.<\/p><p> In summary, as we accommodate the new recruits in their stations and work, it is important to add to that manpower the necessary technological and other equipment and Garda fleet vehicles, all of which have seen increases this year and will see further considerable increases in the next three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#D00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":659,"content":"<p>On that last point, for clarification, what is being spent this year on ICT as distinct from last year?

In the context of all the committee has addressed with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and interested other parties during the course of this year, it has been reflected time after time that the equipment and PULSE system are not fit for purpose.  I am not, hopefully, stealing his opportunity, but it is absolutely ancillary to what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said.

That strategy will cover the three-year period form this year up to 2021.  The acting Garda Commissioner is scheduled to come to the Oireachtas on ICT issues over the next few weeks.

Is there any indication that the issue is being addressed properly?  If one looks at the most recent year for which we have figures, namely, 2016, the number of breaches of public procurement guidelines by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone was 94, which amounted to &euro;27.8 million.  Does the Minister expect to see a decrease for the 2017 and 2018 accounts?  The figures suggest that breaches are increasing year on year, rather than decreasing.  In 2015, there were 73 breaches of public procurement rules by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In July 2017, the director of finance for the Garda, Mr. Michael Culhane, told Deputy Connolly that he accepted 73 was a high number but the Garda was addressing actively all of those issues and working with the Office of Government Procurement.  If we fast-forward to the 2016 accounts for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which were released in September 2017, there were 94 contracts which breached public procurement guidelines.  As I said, that amounted to &euro;27.8 million.<\/p> <p>  Is the Minister concerned that no one seems to be responsible for this?  I asked Ms Josephine Feehily, chair of the Policing Authority, about this issue last month.  She said that one thing that frustrated one of her colleagues was that if the Garda wants to hire a clerical officer, it must approval from the Policing Authority whereas if it wants to spend &euro;10 million on ICT, it does not.  She said the authority had a very narrow competence in respect of money and she believes it should be broadened.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on that?  To give him an example from today's figures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's expenditure on external ICT services for 2018 is estimated to be &euro;41 million.  In 2016, it was &euro;50 million.  An audit by the Garda internal audit section found that &euro;26.5 million of that was paid to Accenture, dated from a contract of 2009 and was in breach of public procurement guidelines.  Does the Minister have an indication as to whether the &euro;41 million estimated to be spent on external ICT for 2018 has been properly tendered for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#E00800","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":666,"content":"<p>This is an issue the Deputy has been addressing in the D&aacute;il.  I am aware of an internal audit report last August which raised some concerns and made a number of recommendations regarding the procurement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of certain ICT services.  I understand from Garda authorities that the contract in question commenced in 2009.  It ran for an initial two-year period with a further two-year extension until the end of 2013.  It was extended after this time without recourse to tendering.  I understand that there was a delay in the tendering for the contract due to a combination of factors, including the complex nature of the process but also a lack of resource in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prepare a new tender and run an appropriate procurement competition.  It can be recalled that the Garda ICT area suffered from the general reduction in the ICT cohort throughout the public sector.  However, another factor was that ICT management was awaiting the development of the national procurement framework.  I am concerned by this issue and any breach.  No breach in what is a specifically designed arrangement would in the circumstances be accommodated or accepted.  Steps are now being taken to ensure all the recommendations in the internal audit report are implemented.  Progress in this regard is being monitored internally by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and by my Department.  I understand the position regarding the main contract will be addressed.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, framework has been in place since last August.  It is currently being utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tender for its skills requirements.

In the context of the Minister's opening remarks about improved civilianisation inside the Garda, and particularly given that the Policing Authority told us, and indeed the Minister, that the targets for civilian recruitment are way off and the authority has huge concerns about this, why are we allocating less money to pay this year than was spent last year?

It is very important that garda&iacute; be allowed to do their job and that we see a Garda presence on the streets, motorways, back roads, etc.  It is great that the Garda College Templemore has been reopened.  It means that we will have extra garda&iacute; coming out every year.  I was delighted when I heard that there would be an extra 4,000 civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by 2021.  I was led to believe that when this happened, between 1,500 and 2,000 trained garda&iacute; would be back on the beat or on motorways.  Will the Minister confirm how many trained garda&iacute; will be released to carry out garda jobs when the target of 4,000 civilian staff is reached?

The people in the queue might be dealing with motor tax or passports.  The people who have been assaulted should get some special treatment.  It is not fair that they must wait to report the crime.  What plans does the Minister have for that? <\/p><p> The station in Dundalk has done well in getting new recruits but the station building needs work.  I have said this before to the Minister.  It is close to the M1 but the traffic coming off it is unattended.  It has no space to expand.  There is another Garda station a few miles away off the M1 called Dromad.  Are there any plans to invest money in Dromad?  It is so congested it impossible for people to park in the area.  The extra resources in the Garda station have helped combat crime.  It is a Border county.  Could the Minister come to Dundalk over the next few weeks?  Is it the case that in most Garda stations there is only one garda and a queue of people?

I am keen to ensure that the civilianisation programme not only continues but gathers momentum and is accelerated.  There are more than 2,250 full-time civilians in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na doing administrative and technical duties.  It is important that the process continues.  Sanction has been obtained for 281 further posts.  We are considering first addressing some skill gaps and capacity issues, for example, civilians with expertise in the area of finance and information and communications technology, ICT.  The Garda is engaging with the Policing Authority in respect of 116 business cases.  I want to see movement on these over the coming weeks.  The immediate consequence of this will be redeployment.  We have set a target of replacing 1,500 garda&iacute;.  I want to see as many garda&iacute; as possible returning to core full-time duties because that is what they are best placed to do and that is what their core training equips them for.  The principal focus so far has been on filling critical skill gaps.  I would be happy to keep the committee fully informed.  It is a priority to ensure that by 2021 there will be a civilian cohort within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of 4,000.  They will work with, or be an integral part of, a Garda force of 21,000, including 15,000 sworn members, 4,000 civilians and 2,000 reservists.  It is important to put more emphasis on the Garda Reserve.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of this committee in passing the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.  The Commissioner has put in place a victim service office in each of the 28 Garda divisions.  These will be the central point for victims of crime in each division.  They will be staffed by people who have specific training in prioritising the needs of victims and there will be specially trained civilian personnel.  The focus is firmly on the second national strategy on domestic sexual and gender-based violence and the range of actions to be implemented by the State.<\/p> <p>  There is a Garda station building plan, particulars of which are, I am sure, well known to this committee.  This is designed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet the needs of specific areas.  I am sure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is considering the Border constituencies, such as County Louth and the Chairman's constituency, in the context of the changed circumstances caused by Brexit and with particular reference to the unacceptable level of cross-Border crime.  I would be happy to engage bilaterally with Deputy Fitzpatrick in response to his invitation to visit the area and would be anxious to consider that favourably.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#J00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":733,"content":"<p>Information technology is a multifaceted area.

There is a capital programme for Garda stations which is providing for new stations in Wexford, a headquarters in Galway, and the state-of-the-art premises within a stone's throw of these buildings in Kevin Street.  These modern Garda headquarters have the type of facilities the Chairman referred to, all of which are necessary in the circumstances.  I am very keen to see the roll-out of the next phase of the public private partnership, PPP, project within the next few weeks.  This will involve capital expenditure on new Garda headquarters in Clonmel, in Macroom in north-west Cork, and in Sligo.  It is important that designs under our Garda building programme accommodate suites for people in difficult and vulnerable situations.  Such people visit Garda stations every day.  I want to see all that money and more spent.<\/p> <p>  As far as ICT is concerned, the ICT strategy is very important.  Included in it will be a complete revamp of the PULSE system.

It is incredibly paternalistic to introduce a structure of this type for female offenders who are moving back into the community, particularly given that women are generally incarcerated for crimes of poverty and other offences with low levels of violence.  We would prefer a much more empowering structure to be established to enable women to move back to their communities and live in proper accommodation rather than in some sort of halfway house.  Most European countries are moving away from the halfway house model.

That is the type of facility we are speaking of in terms of what is called a step across into the community.  I recently visited a successful engagement in Waterford which prepares prisoners for work.

My understanding is that it has embarked on a second recruitment campaign in recent years.  The previous one met some difficulties because applicants did not have previous experience reflected in their pay and conditions and other similar considerations.  Is the Minister satisfied with the level of recruitment to Forensic Science Ireland with this current campaign?<\/p> <p>  I am not familiar with the proposal for a merger with the Garda technical bureau.  Will Forensic Science Ireland be entirely incorporated with the technical bureau?<\/p> <p>  Several months ago, I asked at the committee whether a decision support service could actually be delivered within 2018.  There was some hesitancy as to whether it was possible.  Can a decision support service be delivered by 2018?  If not, it is disappointing, given that it relates to legislation which is now three years old and is closely related to Ireland ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p> <p>  There has been considerable discussion about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  The Minister said he has allocated an additional &euro;300,000 to the commission.  GSOC has clearly made the case in correspondence to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, correspondence which is in the public domain, that it needs &euro;900,000 to conduct its business properly, particularly regarding protected disclosures.  In general, GSOC is underfunded.<\/p><p>Yesterday we discussed the incident in Omeath.  I relayed to the Minister that GSOC had clearly said that it did not have the capacity to get to that case at any time soon, and it was on that basis that I called for a public inquiry.  GSOC is generally underfunded, and it is struggling with protected disclosures especially.  A properly investigated and supported protected disclosure is far cheaper than a tribunal or a commission of investigation.  GSOC believes the funding that has been provided is clearly inadequate.  How does the Minister respond to that?  Does he intend to address this?<\/p><p> The funding for a SAVI 2 report will likely fall under this head.  The Minister and the Government were considering that and a scoping document has been commissioned.  What is the status of this document?

A total of &euro;9 million is being provided for that this year which is earmarked for the main construction on this site.  The full cost of the construction and fit-out will only be known once the tendering process is complete, which is expected in the second quarter of 2018.

The points have been made about that already.<\/p> <p>  I have three quick questions.  First, on direct provision, the Estimate for 2018 seems to be the same as the spend for 2017.  Is that because the Government expects the same numbers of asylum seekers or is it the case that contracts have been negotiated with the private operators who make a lot of money from this service regardless of the numbers of people in the system?

The Minister has said &euro;4 million has been made available and that staff numbers are due to increase by 50%.  That sounds like a lot and is certainly something about which I would like to hear more.  Frankly, I do not consider such measures as being anything near enough in the context of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I ask the Minister to consider the fact that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will now be the lead supervisory authority in cases involving companies such as Google and Facebook.  Also, as many as 89% of Facebook users are served by Facebook Ireland.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland will be the main regulator of how Facebook uses and shares the data of its users.  How can the office do such work with an extra &euro;4 million?  I have not even mentioned the more general responsibilities of the office under the GDPR in monitoring and policing public and private usage.

An extra &euro;300,000 will not scratch the surface in meeting the challenges that face GSOC.  However, &euro;67 million is a lot of money, yet it is pretty much agreed that the current structure is seriously disappointing and not fit for purpose.  I understand GSOC was designed as a temporary measure when first established.  Instead, the organisation has lasted a long time.

On GSOC, resources and funding are kept under continuing review.  I repeat it is absolutely essential that the ombudsman commission operates effectively and has sufficient resources to allow for that effective operation.  A few weeks ago a business proposal was submitted seeking 37 additional staff at a cost of &euro;1.7 million.  This matter is under active consideration at the moment.  Active consideration is also being given to allowing GSOC to retain an additional &euro;1 million in funding from the now closed fixed charge notices, FCN, investigation.  That would put GSOC in a position to address some of the issues raised.  Consideration will be given to providing GSOC with its own Vote and providing that an officer of GSOC would be the Accounting Officer in the context of proposals to change legislation.  In this regard, as I said earlier, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which will report to me in September, is important.  I believe there is an important role for that body in assessing the current independence or otherwise of GSOC.  I look forward to ongoing engagement with the chairman and members of the commission with a view to ensuring that it fulfils its statutory functions in such a way that those who are in receipt of or seeking its services will have confidence.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of direct provision, it is not my wish that people would spend long periods in accommodation provided by the State.  While I acknowledge there are shortcomings, I also acknowledge the firm progress that has been made on the recommendations put forward by the former judge, Mr. Justice McMahon.  Most of his recommendations are now being implemented.  I am committed to making further improvements in the protection process, including the matter of State-provided accommodation.  I must say there are challenges there but we will continue to meet those challenges in a way that benefits everybody involved in the system.  That said, I accept the situation is far from ideal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#P00100","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":810,"content":"<p>We all realise the number of people seeking asylum or refugee status here will not diminish in the near future, given the amount of wars that are taking place around the world.  We only have to look to places like Yemen to see that a lot of the problems of tomorrow are being created today by the indiscriminate destruction in that country.  It is probably worth noting that none of the three countries that were so eager to bomb Syria last week wants to take in Syrian refugees.  We will have serious challenges in this area for a long time to come.  Maybe instead of these glorified refugee camps we should be considering the State itself doing something directly in terms of building facilities that can provide accommodation for these people while they wait for their applications to be processed.  We should consider this rather than relying on a mercenary private sector which is providing despicable conditions for these people.  Has there be any thought given to that option?  Would the State consider it?  It is not as though we are getting a bargain at &euro;67 million.

In the meantime, it needs to be pointed out that the accommodation system certainly provides for the basic needs of people while they are awaiting a determination or a decision on their application.  I will continue to ensure that the process of improvement in protection continues.  I refer specifically to the work Mr. Justice McMahon has done.  The recommendations he made are being systematically and progressively worked through.

Perhaps it is unfair and the Minister may not have the information immediately to hand.  Does the Minister know the average length of stay of individuals or families in direct provision centres?  Does he know the longest period of time spent, either currently or historically, in direct provision?  Nobody in this room would not concur that the most objectionable aspect of all this is that in some cases, people are in direct provision, with their lives suspended, for years.  There would be a general acceptance of direct provision as long as it was always understood that it was short term.  It baffles me that it takes so long to process individual applications.  It is better to have a result that is reflective of the facts and information to hand rather than this suspension of peoples' lives, which is soul destroying for them, particularly where there are children involved.  It is absolutely dreadful.  I have to say this is the area that causes greatest concern in my opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#P00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":813,"content":"<p>There are a little over 400 people in direct provision for a period of five years or more.

I am assured that if that is the case, she is one of a very small number of persons.  We need to ensure that applications are dealt with expeditiously and efficiently.  The numbers in direct provision accommodation for a period of five years or more at the end of December last year are significantly lower than those in a similar position at the end of December 2016.  The numbers are down from just under 600 to 430.<\/p><p>However, it is important that we ensure the applications are dealt with.

As members are all aware, transport, tourism and sport face challenging times with numerous issues arising from Brexit and capital and current infrastructure projects in all three sectors, as well as many other issues that we have discussed in our joint committee.  The financing and resourcing for the year ahead of the responses to those challenges will be very important.  Our committee will get to explore this today with some emphasis on several key issues.

The 2018 provision for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport comprises an overall gross allocation of &euro;2.03 billion.  This is to be used to provide investment in critical infrastructure and to ensure that vital services are available to the public during 2018.  The &euro;2.03 billion represents an increase of more than 11% on gross expenditure levels from 2017.  This is an increase of 3.4%, or &euro;23 million, in current or day-to-day expenditure, while capital or investment expenditure will increase by over &euro;197 million, or 17%.  This additional funding across all sectors will help us to invest and expand services this year beyond what was conceivable only a few years ago.  In following years, there will be a significant intensification in activity.<\/p> <p>  I wish to say a few words about Project Ireland 2040 which, as members are aware, includes the national planning framework and the ten-year national development plan, NDP.  The programme of investment set out in the NDP will result in a comprehensive road, bus and rail network.  This will provide a high level of service to all regions and will link the regions to one another, as well as to Dublin.  It will be delivered progressively to match transport demand and deliver benefits steadily over the next decade.  This investment in transport will improve accessibility to every part of the country.  In the context of Brexit, this is crucial for the transport and tourism sectors.  This is supported by the non-Exchequer investments set out in the tier 1 area of the NDP, namely, ports and their access routes.  Similarly the improved access to airports will facilitate access to tourism and export markets. <\/p> <p>  I will now briefly address the five programmes of investment in my Department and the funding levels and plans we have for 2018.<\/p> <p>  The civil aviation programme has an allocation of &euro;28 million this year.  The largest element of the programme is the regional airports programme at &euro;13.6 million.  Funding is also earmarked to cover costs associated with our membership of Eurocontrol, other subscriptions to international organisations and costs incurred by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, for exempt services.  The State reimburses the IAA for communication and air navigation services in respect of exempted classes of users, that is, military and state aircraft.  The key priority for investment in the aviation programme over the short to medium term is to facilitate continued safe and viable operations at the regional airports and to maintain air access to relatively remote regions, specifically counties Donegal and Kerry.<\/p> <p>  The land transport programme, which is the largest programme by far in my Department&rsquo;s Vote and represents 81% of my overall budget, will increase this year by &euro;203 million or 14% to &euro;1.66 billion.  A large portion of this is capital investment.  The main components of the programme are roads improvement and maintenance funding with an overall budget of &euro;883 million, the public transport investment programme at &euro;401 million and public service provision payments at &euro;300 million.  The programme also includes provision of &euro;5.5 million towards the carbon reduction programme and operating costs of the national vehicle driver licensing system at &euro;19 million.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of public transport, I secured increased multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period.  This includes providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for a multi-modal public transport investment programme between 2018 and 2021.  The four-year envelope will allocate investment to protect the quality and value of our existing public transport networks.  Programmes to be funded include BusConnects, MetroLink, DART expansion, ongoing retrofitting of older existing public transport facilities to improve their accessibility features, as well as cycling and walking and traffic management measures, both in our capital and nationwide.  These programmes will be implemented by Irish Rail and the National Transport Authority, NTA, which has statutory responsibility for development of public transport in the greater Dublin area. <\/p> <p>  This year, I secured an 8% increase in the overall Exchequer funding for public service obligation, PSO, services across the bus and rail networks.  These services have grown in recent years, and the increase in funding in 2018 brings the cumulative increase over the three years from 2016 to 2018 to &euro;75 million, or 36%.  That means that a total of more than &euro;285 million will be allocated in 2018 to support the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services.  It is of course also an area which requires ongoing scrutiny to ensure the taxpayer receives value for money in respect of the services delivered, given the considerable expenditure incurred.  As is normal, the precise allocations to the companies, including Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, will be decided by the NTA in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.  Additionally, rural transport services that respond to local needs have also increased and we will continue to support these through enhanced funding.<\/p> <p>  In respect of roads, my main priority remains the maintenance and safety of the network.  The 2018 allocation will allow approximately 2,300 km of the regional and local road network to be maintained and approximately 2,100 km to be strengthened.  Major capital roads projects to be progressed include the Naas bypass widening, Sallins bypass and Osberstown interchange project, the upgrading of the Nangor and Adamstown roads near Grange Castle Business Park; and two public private partnership, PPP, projects which are under construction, namely, the New Ross bypass and the Gorey to Enniscorthy project, the Gort to Tuam PPP having been completed and the route opened.  Planning, design, land acquisition and advance works will continue on other major capital plan schemes including the Dunkettle scheme, the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme, the N4 from Collooney to Castlebaldwin scheme and the N5 from Westport to Turlough scheme.<\/p> <p>  I will now comment on road safety.  The operations of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety are within the remit of my Department.  While the funding for these two bodies is small, at just over &euro;5 million, the work achieved by both is huge and vitally important.  I note the RSA has significant revenue-raising powers.  Last year, 2017, was the safest year on Ireland&rsquo;s roads since road deaths were first recorded in 1959, with 159 deaths.  While even one death is too many, I hope this trend in decreased road deaths continues.  We will continue to support those bodies in achieving their goals.<\/p><p>The key funding priorities for the maritime transport and safety programme in 2018 are the maintenance of the Irish Coast Guard's search and rescue helicopter service, the continuation of the Coast Guard building programme for volunteers and an annual contribution of more than &euro;7 million towards the costs of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  Of the &euro;96 million provided for the maritime, transport and safety programme,<b><\/b>&euro;66 million is provided for the Irish Coast Guard's helicopter search and rescue contract.  Current expenditure of &euro;3.5 million is provided for to meet the operational costs and training of volunteer Irish Coast Guard units.  The capital allocation of &euro;5 million will be used to meet the building and renovation costs of Irish Coast Guard stations, replace and upgrade search and rescue-related equipment, develop new IT systems and procure other equipment relating to the Irish Coast Guard's remit.  My Department continues to support the excellent work carried out by the Irish Coast Guard and its volunteer cadre.  Its work was seen during the recent Storm Emma weather alert, where it supported local communities, principal response agencies and the emergency services.<br\/><br\/>The sports programme shows an increase from 2017 of more than &euro;3 million to &euro;111 million.  The sports capital programme is the primary means of providing Government funding to sport and community organisations at local, regional and national level.  In November and December 2017, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I announced &euro;60 million in allocations under the 2017 round of the sports capital programme to more than 1,800 different sporting projects.  The investment envelope covers these awards and commitments made under earlier rounds of the programme.  The capital envelope for sport also provides &euro;4 million to meet all existing commitments under the local authority swimming pool programme.  Further funding of &euro;5 million was made available for sports measures through dormant accounts funding, mainly towards supporting the implementation of the national physical activity plan in disadvantaged communities.<br\/><br\/>As for future investment, the recently published national development plan contains a commitment to establish a new large scale sport infrastructure fund for which at least &euro;100 million will be available during the roll-out of the NDP.  My officials will draft the terms and conditions of this new fund over the coming months.  This fund will be for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution would exceed the amount currently available for projects under the sports capital programme.  The allocation for Sport Ireland will allow it to continue to address its key priorities of increasing participation in sport and developing and supporting high performance sport in Ireland.  Work commenced in July 2017 on the development of phase 2 of the national indoor arena<b>, <\/b>which is due for completion in mid-2019.  This phase will see the construction of full-sized and half-sized covered synthetic pitches, capable of accommodating all field sports, together with changing facilities, offices, meeting rooms etc.<br\/><br\/>I turn to the tourism services programme.  The overall envelope for tourism this year will be &euro;134 million, which represents an increase of &euro;12 million on 2017.  This includes an allocation of &euro;3.6 million for greenways.  Greenways have been a stand-out success story and a new development strategy is being worked on at present.  The draft strategy should be published and available within the next few weeks.  The &euro;134 million allocation for the tourism programme will allow F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to continue to develop Ireland's tourism industry, driven by the further development and promotion of the signature experience brands Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  Last Thursday, I launched Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, a new tourism brand that will significantly enhance the midlands and bring jobs and economic growth to the whole region.<br\/><br\/>As we are all aware, Brexit is a significant challenge and Tourism Ireland has a programme of marketing activity in place for 2018.  This programme will ensure Ireland is marketed appropriately in Great Britain while seeking to build on the successful strategy of market diversification implemented since 2014.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also launched a &quot;Get Brexit ready&quot; programme of business supports to provide all the relevant information and insights businesses will need.  Last year, I said that 2016 had been an exceptional year for overseas visitors.  Today, I am happy to be able to say that 2017 was a record-breaking year.  The pattern is continuing in the early months of 2018.  The CSO recently confirmed that, in the two months to the end of February 2018, the total number of trips to Ireland increased by 7.9% when compared with the same period in 2017.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, in 2017 we made good progress across all the programmes under my Department's remit.  I have secured in budget 2018 increased multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period and look forward to progressing the major infrastructural projects included in the NDP.  I expect to see continued momentum across all sectors.  I am happy to answer any questions in respect of the 2018 Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#B00700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":851,"content":"<p>The meeting is now open to the floor.

The introduction of the third Luas line has exposed a capacity constraint in the city centre in terms of the amount of surface space to be shared.  A project that is not included in the national development plan is the DART underground.  The Minister referred to how every part of the country was accessible, but the place that is probably the least accessible is the one where there is the greatest amount of public transport.  As part of this meeting, we will be considering matters such as moving people into more sustainable types of public transport owing to potential fines, since transport is one of the main areas in respect of which those fines will be incurred.  Is the Minister involved in any discussion on revising the plan or is there any scope for such a reconsideration in this year's budget?<\/p> <p>  I asked questions about the rolling stock.  The point of order to the point of delivery takes five years and I understand that there is nothing on order at the moment, although some rolling stock is being refurbished.  To use the Maynooth line as an example, services that originate in Maynooth are standing room only even from the first train at 6.40 a.m. until it reaches Leixlip, which is the next stop.  We can only move people onto sustainable forms of public transport if that transport is available.  They would undoubtedly use it.<\/p><p>Is there any scope with regard to orders regarding new rolling stock in the budget at which we are looking or will any be initiated?  <\/p><p> In respect of the roads programme, I know some of the money goes to Transport Infrastructure Ireland and that is for national roads.  Other funding comes from the local property tax.  About ten local authorities are required to self fund from the local property tax.  For example, Dublin funds entirely through the local property tax.  It does not get a transfer from Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  What account, if any, is taken in this budget of the local property tax in the figures that have been presented?  Is that an additional amount?  Given that this is being revisited, is the Minister accounting for the changes that might happen as a consequence of those changes and that might reduce the amount that is required to be self funded by some of the local authorities?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#D04800","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":909,"content":"<p>In respect of the roads budget, and I acknowledge there is an increase, does the Department factor in the exceptional weather such as that we experienced in the past number of months?

However, I have a number of concerns.  Deputy O'Keeffe has already highlighted one that concerns the condition of our regional and county roads.  We brought forward a Private Members' motion in January 2018 to which the Minister undertook to reply and outline clearly how he and the Department intend to address the deficiencies highlighted in the review of our county and regional roads.  The roads have got progressively worse with the bad weather over the past number of months.  I acknowledge that the Minister cannot be blamed for the bad weather.  I would not try to land blame on him where it is not merited but he is in a position to ensure that each local authority is adequately resourced to respond to that bad weather.  Could he indicate when he will fulfill his commitment under the Private Members' motion and publish his reply and timeframe for the works to be completed?<\/p> <p>  Under documents to be published, I understand the Department is reviewing optimal land use in terms of settlement strategy.  At what stage is that optimal land use review?  The Minister identified a number of bottlenecks that would help address and give priority to buses and public transport.  Have the various transport companies - Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail from a signalling point of view - identified a list of works that could be completed that would alleviate bottlenecks, reduce journey time and increase the efficiency of the service?  If so, where are those lists, who is adjudicating them, who is costing them and is there a timeframe for when work might commence?  <\/p> <p>  In his contribution, the Minister mentioned cycling infrastructure.  Unfortunately, during his term, the cycling infrastructure budget has almost halved.  Perhaps I am missing it in the documents here.  Is it the Minister's intention to reverse previous years' reductions in the cycling infrastructure budget?  If so, how much does he intend to reverse it by?  What is the 2018 figure?  <\/p> <p>  Anyone looking in here today will acknowledge that there are plans for Metro North, BusConnects and new road investments but the simple fact is that I got a phone call yesterday morning from a friend of mine who lives in Dublin 8 who told me that at 8.30 a.m. two trams and three buses passed him by because they were chock-a-block.  There is no capacity in our public transport services.  With the best will in the world, as Deputy Catherine Murphy already alluded to, there is a five-year lead-in time for any new train to be ordered.  The Minister has yet to say what he can do now to address overcrowding.  Is there any commitment on his part to increase the number of buses?  He constantly says that the number of new buses ordered by Dublin Bus is in the region of 100 or 112 - correct me if I am wrong - but in fact, he never allows for or acknowledges the fact that every year under the 12-year rule, a number of buses go out of service so the net increase in terms of the number of buses for Dublin Bus is in the low teens per annum at a time when the number of people using public transport is increasing steadily, which is to be welcomed.  However, people will not continue to use it if it is not reliable and is overcrowded.  Unfortunately, this is what is happening now.  The longer trams have been delayed.  Freedom of information requests I have submitted to the Department indicate that it was aware that there were potential technical difficulties with the longer trams but the Minister proceeded to roll them out.  Now we have a situation where they have gone back to the manufacturers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#E02900","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524040800,"counter":937,"content":"<p>Has the Minister a timeframe as to when we can expect those longer trams to be back in operation?<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":938,"content":"<p>Deputy Troy has alluded to the question of increasing congestion and I accept what he said about trams, trains and buses.  The Department needs a strategic plan for dealing with congestion to ensure work days do not get any longer than they have become.

If one has to use the car, one has no alternative but to sit in longer queues.  I know the metro has good proposals for strategic park-and-ride facilities around the Malahide estuary which would be hugely welcomed when they are in place.  Is there any way we could fast-track some of those proposals?<\/p> <p>  What plans has the Minister for dealing with congestion, longer commute days and people getting home late at night?  When I use the M1 motorway, the average speed, even at 10 o'clock at night, is 100 km\/h.  People are in long traffic queues.  I fear for the issue now unless we deal with it strategically.

With speeds and so forth, it does not equate with a DART underground.  We already have a problem with capacity on surface rail.  Without using below-ground capacity, there will always be that constraint.<\/p> <p>  I was a member of the Dublin transportation initiative in the early 1990s when a suite of measures was deemed necessary to make the city capable of functioning.  The reason European funding was provided at the time under a particular programme was because Dublin was underperforming due to congestion.  For example, Luas, metro and the DART underground proposals were all critical components in making the city function.  The investment in the railways was from the 19th century where they are all disconnected from each other.  The 20th century required pulling them together.  We failed to do that in the 20th century and we are now going to fail to do it in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>  I was in Berlin recently, a city with a population of 4.5 million, a much larger population than Dublin, and did not see one traffic jam.  It is because it has a network and not bits and pieces of a network.  The DART underground is that critical missing piece for Dublin.  I have to take issue with the Phoenix Park tunnel being equated with a substitute for DART underground.  It simply is not.  There is no understanding of the requirement of making this capital city work.  The city and the region cannot work without that piece of the network.  The ever longer traffic jams on the M1, the M4 and the M7, as pointed out by the Chairman, are a consequence of not having a proper public transport system in Dublin city.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has made a political decision on it and it is not part of the ten-year strategy.

For the most part they are reliant on cars and motor vehicles to take them around the county and to bring them in and out of it.  In the last number of months, the ponding of water has become a serious problem on county, regional and national secondary roads and even on the national primary road at Glenflesk.  Does the Minister have contingency or emergency plans to deal with the ponding of water?  It is a serious issue affecting the health and safety of people who travel on our roads.  It is a severe risk.  Many of the inlets where the water should be going are closed up.  I ask the Minister to liaise with the local authorities - we have been asking them and it appears they do not have the funding - with a view to giving them more funding to specifically deal with the problem of the ponding of water on the sides of our roads.  Cars have to swerve out but if there is a car coming against them they cannot do that.  It means they drive into a pool of water, it goes over the roof of the car and they cannot see where they are.  They are hitting ditches and it is a problem at present.  It is a fine day in Dublin today and it was a fine day here yesterday but it poured out of the heavens in Kerry yesterday and it is pouring out of the heavens in Kerry again today.

That allocation was a largely increased allocation.  It was a substantially increased allocation for local roads.  It was accompanied by a clear message to local authorities that they should provide their own contingency fund in the event of exceptional damage of this sort.  That was made absolutely clear to them at the time and that remains the situation.  There obviously will be forms to fill in.  They can apply clean-up charges, which I gather they are doing at the moment, and they are receiving them.  There are no plans for any extra funds to be provided as a result of the storm damage in Storm Emma because of the stipulation that was made at the time that they should make their own contingencies and because there were large increases.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy asked about the clean-up costs.  Local authorities could certainly apply for clean-up costs and I gather a large number of them have done so.  They will get a response from my Department in due course.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy also asked about cycling infrastructure and said the budget has been halved.  The intention is to increase the budget on cycling infrastructure over four years and to treble it.  That was made absolutely clear.  More than &euro;100 million - I think it was &euro;110 million - was provided for new urban cycling and walking routes in the greater Dublin area and in the Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford city areas, which will provide additional and sustainable travel options to complement increased capacity and faster, higher quality public transport in our main cities.  In previous years, the greenways provided the bulk of the cycling infrastructure.  We separated greenways and increased their funding in the current budget and in the years ahead.<\/p><p>We have provided a large amount of money - I think it is &euro;56 million - for greenways in the coming three years.

It is taking a huge step forward, not just in this but in greenways and in other areas as well.  The Deputy has seen the Stayin' Alive at 1.5 campaign and has been a great supporter of it.  It is important that it is recognised that the Government is behind cycling infrastructure, safety for cyclists and other cycling measures which we are taking and are going to pursue.  The greenways will not only attract tourists, they will also be useful in terms of reducing pollution and traffic congestion in towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has asked what we are doing now.  The thrust of Government policy on congestion is long term; it has to be long term.  The long-term aim is to get people out of their cars but we are not going to get people out of their cars overnight, just like that.  We will do it using a multifaceted approach which includes increased investment in public transport, cycling and walking and in other areas.  We need to do this, not just because of congestion but for many reasons, including health.  Some of these projects are moving faster than others, of course.  The Luas cross-city and green line extension means that the Luas will accommodate an extra 10 million journeys per annum.  That is immediate and is happening now.  It has been a massive success to such an extent that there has been overcrowding on the trams.  That is something that should be acknowledged.  Passenger numbers on the green line have increased by 28% and that is obviously taking a lot of people off the roads.  The numbers are much larger than expected and we welcome that.  The teething problems to which one of the speakers alluded are being resolved and the Luas will continue to keep those people off the roads.  The BusConnects programme will be starting next year, which is a very exciting and modern form of public transport.  It will be comfortable, efficient and fast and will be effective in taking people off the roads, as will the DART expansion and MetroLink.  I am not going to be able to get people off the roads in the morning and I have never said that.  However, we are attacking this problem in both the short and long term in a way which will resolve it over the medium term.  That is the way it is going to be done but Deputies cannot ask me to say \"tomorrow, this will happen\".  It will not happen.  There are increasing numbers but it is going to happen in the long term.  The plans are laid out very clearly as to how that is going to be done.  It is going to be very effective and that is what the national development plan is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#J00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>With all due respect, I have read the plan for 2040.

The Minister stated that he had visited Rosslare Europort a week ago and referred to its potential.  I share his sentiments, in that Brexit may possess significant potential for the port.  I am wondering about something in the context of its funding, though.  The rail line to the port generates in the region of &euro;2 million per annum, which is absorbed by CI&Eacute; into its central funding.  I submitted a parliamentary question on this matter.  A motion was passed unanimously by Wexford County Council calling for the structure to be examined with a view to Rosslare Europort retaining that funding and using it to extract even greater funding.  The Minister mentioned how European funding was becoming available and that each port would have to apply for that itself.  He has received correspondence on this matter.

When I was in Rosslare, I was struck by how we had a port that could take more advantage of events like Brexit.  It was my first visit to the port.  I received some particularly enterprising suggestions, which should be examined in a more forensic way than I could do in half an hour at a meeting.  There are possibilities that might not have been examined.  Perhaps some of the structure, template and model could be altered and improved.  I do not want to say much more than that, but the Deputy understands what I mean.  I am not in any way suggesting that the port should be reduced in size.  Rather, if there are opportunities, it might be good for the region and the people who live in the locality.  What the Deputy has said is constructive.

I use every opportunity to raise the matter.  The Minister said in his statement, \"The capital envelope for sport also provides &euro;4 million to meet all existing commitments under the local authority swimming pool programme.\"  The original local authority swimming pool programme opened in about the year 2000.  I know in many cases swimming pools have been completed, but many others were on the list but did not commence or the work on them was not completed.  The programme opened again in a very limited way and there were applications from three areas that fell within the criteria, and two of the applications were included.  The one that did not meet the criteria, unfortunately, was the one in north Kildare, and that was because of a fault on the Kildare side.  The object is to get one swimming pool per every 50,000 people.  My understanding is that that is roughly the standard.  In Kildare there is one swimming pool for 110,000 people and there is no public swimming pool north of Naas.  The population of, say, Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock would be well in excess of that of Waterford city and would approach that of Limerick city, so it is a big gap.  Regarding the sum of &euro;4 million, for a reasonably modest and good-quality, but not gold-plated, swimming pool, it costs somewhere in the region of &euro;8 million.  There is &euro;4 million in the budget, there are the two applications that came through on the most recent programme and there is the residual from the 2000 programme.  What does the &euro;4 million fund?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#N01000","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":1141,"content":"<p>I have a question.  It is a general question but is based on the issues Deputy Murphy raises.  Regarding the 2040 plan and population growth, taking places such as Drogheda, which has been designated a national growth centre, there will be significant population changes.  The population of Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington in east Meath, for example, has grown from 5,000 to more than 10,000 in an eight-year period.  Is there a case for planning sports infrastructure based on population needs?  Our populations are expanding.  Deputy Murphy rightly picked a conurbation that is bigger than the city of Waterford, and the population of my area is basically the same as that.  There is a deficit, and the problem I see that is really serious is that the planning pressure comes from developers either to purchase existing sports facility grounds and therefore move them away from where the population is or, alternatively, to put pressure on planning authorities for developments without adequate and proper sports facilities.  In other words, should there be, nationally and locally, a sports plan for the expected growth of each growth area in that an area may need X number of playing pitches, Y amount of green space and Z amount of whatever else?  Planners and developers put fierce pressure on local authorities, and we need proper planning and development, we need proper green recreational space and we need proper swimming pools and other facilities.  I do not expect the Minister to answer my question today but I hope this committee might, with the support and agreement of his Department, look at this issue in a national way in order that there are proper recreational facilities and amenities that are contiguous with the expected growth as we decide as a nation to increase the populations in these areas.  One cannot have huge areas with no facilities, with developers running riot and the people left with no infrastructure, with nothing.  I am not just talking about sports infrastructure, there are shopping and other facilities.

In January 2016 the Department contacted local authorities and sought expressions of interest in a limited round of swimming pool allocations.  Three expressions of interest were received.  Two of the applications for new pools were valid and they were both in Dublin.  Of the two in Dublin, Lucan was chosen for inclusion in the programme.  That means the projects that remain in the current programme are Castlebar, Buncrana, Edenderry and Lucan, each of which is at various stages of the programme.  Another pool in Dunmanway officially opened on 6 June 2017.  The priority in 2017 is on progressing projects through to the next stage of the programme, as appropriate.  In relation to the future funding of swimming pools, a review of national sports policy is being finalised at present and it is expected to be published shortly.  The policy statement will include a specific focus on how the Government should fund sports facilities, including swimming pools, in the years ahead.<\/p> <p>  That is not a satisfactory answer for Deputy Catherine Murphy and the Chairman.  As members are aware, pools are very expensive and they do not make money.  They are a service which quite rightly the State subsidises and gives to the community for their health and enjoyment and the importance of sport.  There is a bit of a problem there.

However, what the tourism agencies are doing, and very successfully, is finding new markets.  They are also spending money on the UK, so the numbers are not coming down as far as one might expect if viewed alongside the currency, which has fallen 12%.  The number of visitors from the UK has fallen by a very small percentage compared with that, decreasing by 3% or 4%.  We are doing very well despite the fall in the value of sterling.  That does not mean there is any room for complacency.  We did give them extra money last year for digital marketing and research, and they have used that very well.
