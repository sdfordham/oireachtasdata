Systematic analysis of capacity requirements should be a normal component of any healthcare system's planning cycle.  The last review for Ireland was undertaken in 2007 and focused only on hospital bed capacity.  This review was asked to provide a more wide-ranging assessment to include the capacity needs in both primary care and social care services for older people as well as in acute hospitals.  The review quantifies the demand and future capacity implications across these three domains, which are those most affected by an ageing population and rising prevalence of long-term conditions.  This also aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare report finding that the best health outcomes and value for money can be achieved by reorienting the model of care towards primary and community care.<\/p> <p>  The report sets out our assessment of current capacity, future demand and the impact of future reforms to provide two ends of a spectrum of potential future capacity needs.  We will say more on each of these.  We have established an agreed view of the current capacity across the public and private sectors.  This was determined using two methods.  One was by looking at available resource data from 2016 and the second was by cross-checking with available activity data for 2016, which gives an added level of confidence in the baseline position for 2016 and allows us to reconcile any anomalies.  In addition, we looked at the most recently available international benchmarking from the OECD and EUROSTAT to compare capacity in Ireland to six countries, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland.<\/p> <p>  We looked at the drivers of future demand and estimated them to produce our view of the impact on future capacity requirements to 2031, creating the baseline for the assessment.  Those drivers have been categorised in three ways.  First is demographic, which relates to the growth and changing age structure of the population, notably the rise in the older population in Ireland being particularly dramatic.  This aligns with what the committee has already heard from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  Second are non-demographic drivers, relating to other influences such as changes in medical practice, for instance the trends towards minimally invasive and day case surgery, and the increased prevalence of chronic disease.  Third is addressing unmet demand.  Waiting lists have been used to estimate unmet demand and the report incorporates the additional capacity needed to reduce waiting lists to an acceptable norm over a four year period.  We then set out an analysis of how key changes to the model of care could impact on future demand and capacity across the system.  The review developed three main reform scenarios drawing on a review of current policies, published evidence and international comparators.  These were tested through engagement with a wide range of stakeholders including the Department's international peer review group.<\/p> <p>  The reform scenarios align with current national policies and the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  In particular, they are based around the need to shift care away from an acute-led model, and they assume more integrated care, particularly for management of chronic conditions and care of older people.  They have been defined and modelled in a way that enables us to add them together to come up with an overall assessment of the capacity implications.<\/p><p>The three reform scenarios cover, first, the impact of the healthy Ireland strategy on demand that would be attributable to a broad range of initiatives including actions on tobacco, alcohol and obesity; second, an improved model of care centred around comprehensive community-based services; and third, hospital productivity improvements.  We have taken account of how care needs to be delivered as locally as is clinically appropriate and only centralised where necessary.  Productivity improvements come through improved patient flows through hospitals as well as improvements associated with elective-only sites.  We also noted that much of the evidence for centralising more specialised services relates to improved clinical outcomes more than reducing bed demand.  <\/p><p> In addition, the report also sets out the capacity implications of reducing the average bed occupancy from the current high levels.  <\/p><p> Our headline findings are that the baseline scenario - and I remind members that this involves scaling the current model of care - would require significant increases in capacity across all aspects of the health service up to 2031, including an increase of 7,150 hospital beds on top of the current 13,310.  This factors in the improved occupancy levels and is more than a 50% increase.  It equates to opening a new 550 bed hospital like Tallaght every year from 2018 onwards.  This is still accompanied by significant increases elsewhere across the system: a 30% increase in primary care workforce, a 40% increase in residential care beds and a 70% increase in home care over the period to 2031.  <\/p><p> Moving towards the other end of the spectrum one will find that full implementation of all three reforms would alter the capacity needed across all sectors by 2031 to 2,590 extra hospital beds including around 2,100 inpatient, 300 day case, and 190 adult critical care beds.  This a reduction of 4,560 on the baseline scenario and brings the new capacity down to opening a new 550 bed hospital every third year.  <\/p><p> To achieve this there is an even larger increase in the capacity needed elsewhere in the system, including a further 11.5% points increase in the primary care workforce, making a the total increase of 48%; an additional 1,100 residential care beds, bringing the total extra needed to 13,000; and a further 50% increase in home care (home help hours and home care packages), making the total increase 120%.  In undertaking the review, we have drawn on a wide range of sources, and we have also encountered the well documented limitations of the data available within the system.  In this respect, the analysis of hospital bed capacity is considered robust and provides a sound basis for planning.  There was insufficient data available within the timescales of the review to forecast beyond beds to include specific hospital facilities such as operating theatres and computed tomography, CT scanners.  These would need to be picked up at the next stage as more detailed planning and designs for new facilities are developed.  Our analysis has been sensitive to the specific context in Ireland, for instance in respect of the mix of public and private healthcare, the role of GPs and the nature of the social care services available.  The core of the analysis draws on activity trends as seen in Hospital Inpatient Enquiry, HIPE, and other data sources.  In developing the reform scenarios, we have not just used international comparators, we have drawn on a range of other sources including peer reviewed studies, comparisons of performance across different parts of the system in Ireland, and the views of the many stakeholders engaged through workshops and consultation, as well as the advice from the international peer review group.  The review was asked to inform the development of a national development plan for the next decade and in particular on the scale of the capital infrastructure that will be needed.  Our findings have been accepted by Government and provision for them included in the recently published national development plan.  The Department of Health also have our model and are using it to do more evidence-based planning. <\/p><p> In conclusion, the analysis has established two extremes that define the order of magnitude and range of potential capacity needs and associated the level of changes to the model of care.  The scope of the review did not extend to a comprehensive workforce capacity assessment and one will be needed to assess the rate at which capacity in various parts of the system could be brought into service.  The report sets out the landscape.  Continuing with the current model of care, which is the baseline scenario, will see demand exceed capacity by over 7,000 hospital beds by 2031.  The combined reform scenarios are ambitious.  Noting the complexity involved in bringing a new hospital into service, we believe the combined reform scenarios are likely to be the more feasible option and this is the right basis to move planning to the next level of detail as set out in our recommendations for next steps.  Lastly, may we please place on record our sincere thanks for the significant contributions made by the many people and organisations who were engaged in the review process through meetings, workshops and in contributing to the Department&rsquo;s consultation?  The full report has been circulated to the committee and is publicly available on the Department's website.

On the one hand we have had change in the Irish health system in the past three years with an additional 11,400 people now working in the healthcare sector compared to December 2014.  I am not satisfied additional services are being delivered.  I am concerned about how we can increase the workforce on one level but at the same time not be able to deliver the service to the people who need it on the other side.  I am wondering from the work the consultants have undertaken how they see the process improving in terms of delivering these additional services.  The best example of all is the children's hospital which has taken us nearly 25 years.  The presentation this morning referred to the provision of a new 550 bed unit, literally, every year and then to a delivery every three years.  To deliver it even every three years will be a huge demand.  How does one fast track something like that?  From Mr. MacGinnis's experience, what needs to be done?  There is the whole process of identifying a suitable site,  going through the planning process, going through the appeal process, getting the work done, and then the other issue on staffing.  <\/p> <p> On the staffing of our hospitals OECD reports indicate that we have a ratio of nurses per head of population that is one of the best in the world.  If that is the position, how does one deal with the increase in the number of hospital beds if one already has a high ratio of nurses per head of population; how then is the service delivered?  Do we grow the number of nursing positions again or does one start looking to where the work that nurses are doing now could be done by care assistants?  We need to protect the nursing jobs but we also need to make sure that they have backup support.  How could that be dealt with?<\/p> <p>  The third issue concerns a totally different matter.  When we introduced the fair deal scheme in Ireland, which is for nursing homes, it was a new type of delivery of service.  It was introduced and put in place over a short enough timeframe and has delivered.<\/p><p>The problem now is that there are approximately 23,500 people in private nursing homes, plus a further 6,000 in community hospital facilities.  There are approximately 637,000 elderly people in the State.  By 2030, that figure will be 1 million.  A proportionate increase in nursing home bed numbers would see us needing in or around 40,000 beds.  To avoid it, home care provision would have to be increased.  The delegates referred to a 70% increase in that regard.  My concern is whether we will have an adequate number of people to provide that service.  How do the delegates suggest we deal with recruiting them?  On what do we need to focus if we are to get more people involved in providing what is a superb service for those who require it?  Have the delegates only examined this question to the point of saying provision needs to be increased or have they actually analysed how we should increase it?  We must increase it at a fast pace every year from now on, but I am concerned that we will not have enough people to provide the service.  These are just some questions that immediately pop up from what the delegates have said.<\/p><p> As to structures in hospitals, a question arises as to whether we should change the role of nursing.  The majority of nurses now have academic qualifications, but, to a large extent, we have not increased the role they play with patients.  Many nurses are more than adequately qualified to deal with a lot of the issues junior doctors are handling.  Should we examine workplace practices and the delegation of duties within hospitals?  For instance, there is a significant reliance on junior doctors that is not seen in other countries where there are more structured systems under which permanent and nursing staff deliver services effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#E00300","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>As I have a number of questions, will I just ask one or two now and contribute again later?

The main table shows the numbers of GPs, acute beds, ICU beds, physios and everything else, but it is not a full systems review.  It is only a review of acute services and excludes mental health and palliative care services.  My understanding is that within primary community care services the review focuses on the elderly.  I will ask my first question and leave it at that for now.  How incomplete is the picture the table provides?  I do not mean that as a criticism of the work done.  For example, if the capacity review shows that, in the reform scenario, we need 2,590 additional acute beds, would the total number of acute beds be likely to increase by much were the Department to commission the PA Consulting Group to undertake a full system review?  Similarly, there is a significant number of additional GPs, physiotherapists, allied health professionals and practice nurses, but my concern is that, while the acute review might be reasonably comprehensive, the primary care services review is limited because it is focused on elderly persons.  Will the delegates give us a sense of how much of the picture we are seeing?  Based on their experience of this sort of analysis abroad, is it likely that the total projected numbers of GPs, practice nurses and so on would be significantly higher than what we are seeing if their group was to carry out a full system review of community, primary and social care services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#F00800","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  I get a little confused from time to time, as the Vice Chairman knows.  What confuses me are the confused responses we receive to our questions.  For instance, I have heard expert opinion to the effect that we have too many hospital beds.  Needless to say, I did not agree with it at the time.  On the other hand, it has been stated we have significantly undersupplied hospital registrars.  I am agreeable enough with that opinion.<\/p> <p>  To what degree did the PA Consulting Group examine the issue of bed shortages?  How intensive was the research?  For instance, did the delegates find out why and for how long a patient was waiting for a bed, how many patients were waiting to get into hospital for appointments and how many children were waiting?  It is disgraceful and ludicrous that we must time and again deal with the same issue and ask ourselves why it is happening.  Why is it happening?  Has the research the delegates have undertaken adequately addressed the underlying issues?  Concern has been expressed previously about the ageing population.  I have been guilty of doing this from time to time, but I will also point out that the young population is also increasing, much more so than in any other European country.  That fact is pushed to one side and never forms part of our considerations when planning for the future.<\/p> <p>  Have the delegates taken into account that, if there are extra beds, there will also have to be extra nurses, which is what representatives of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, said when they appeared before us a number of weeks ago?

Donnelly's and Bernard J. Durkan's questions.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight four aspects that we believe are important if progress is to be made in the reform and provision of capacity, the first of which is securing and maintaining clinical leadership in order that there is ownership of the reforms by the clinical body.<\/p> <p>  The second aspect is how one supports hospital groups in operating effectively as a network, including legal regulatory elements to ensure there are incentives for people to work and deliver care in a more integrated way.  In particular and linked with the Senator's question about some of the problems in having the children's hospital established, there is the question of how to win hearts and minds among the clinicians and the public for service reconfiguration.  With specialist services in particular, there is a good case for specialising when necessary and localising where one can, but there is also a hearts and minds element because in these situations care is often moving to a different location.<\/p> <p>  The third aspect we wish to highlight is aligning the hospital groups with the CHOs in order that Ireland can start moving towards population health planning.<\/p> <p>  The final aspect is detailed control, management and planning of any provision of extra capacity.  Unless one monitors the position closely, one can easily provide extra capacity without getting the reform that is supposed to go with it.  Behind it comes a load of more detailed work that one would need to do, particularly on the workforce.  Mr. Nightingale will discuss the units of workforce that we used.  The detailed work can be more nuanced in terms of the skill mix that lies behind some of the job titles that we have used in our modelling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#F01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Daly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Mr. MacGinnis will answer the question asked about nursing, while I will answer the scope question about workforce capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#G00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Nightingale"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I will give an introduction to the nursing problem.  We talk in the report about the immediate injection of the capacity needed to get occupancy levels down to an acceptable norm.  We make the point that, although we have quantified it in bed terms, in practical terms the measures that need to be used are very similar to those with which members will be familiar from the winter pressure planning process.  A combination of things are needed to improve patient flow.  In other industries that would be called productivity.  There is a need to look at blockages in the system.  That is why it was particularly important to look at capacity outside, as well as inside, hospitals.  I know from my experience of working in the system here that this is a key driver of extended lengths of stay, particularly among older people.  There are also internal measures that can be taken.  When we worked with the national clinical programmes in Tallaght, we could see that there was significant potential for improvements in patient flow within the main wards in the hospital, even in the emergency department and the acute medical units on the acute floor.  Patients were being admitted who would not necessarily have needed to be admitted if the right tests and the right things had been done on time.  It is possible for people to be given morning-after appointments in order that they do not have to wait overnight in the emergency department in circumstances in which they are not going to be seen.  Comprehensive geriatric assessments can be made in order that patients who need to be admitted can be moved on quickly and effectively from the acute medical assessment unit.  There are many productivity improvements that could be made.<\/p> <p>  Questions were asked about the staffing of hospitals and workforce reforms.  We did not make a comprehensive workforce assessment.  The review has significant workforce implications for capacity within hospitals and other areas.  As Mr. Daly has alluded to, workforce reform should be on the cards when the scale of things is examined, but it is not something we have looked at specifically.  It is really a matter for the professions to get together and agree what the suitable roles are.  I have mentioned the work we are doing with the national clinical programmes in Tallaght.  One of the simple measures on which we worked with them involved doctors being able to delegate to nurses the authority to discharge patients at the weekend.  We worked with them on a paper form to authorise nurses to get on with discharging patients whose test results had come back with certain acceptable results without having to wait for the next ward round.  The presence of advanced nurse practitioners is another example of the measures being introduced.  Such personnel can engage in all sorts of duty, including prescribing.  Consideration could also be given to workforce reform for care assistants in other areas.  The scale we have set out means that there is no silver bullet.  The comprehensive package of reforms we are discussing is akin to some of the reforms that were on the cards previously, as clearly outlined in the Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare report last year.  We expect it to come through.  <\/p> <p>  I want to make sure I have answered the question about the changing role of nurses.  I think I wrapped it up in my response to the two other questions.  In summary, this is a big reform package.  It is not just about providing capacity anywhere.  As Mr. Daly said, if capacity is the only thing that is introduced, it will be used in the same old way - it will block up in same old way and we will get the same old results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I will answer Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly's questions about the scope of the review.  Some good questions were asked.  The exclusion of mental health and disability services from the scope of the review was agreed at the start when the terms were set out by the Department.  The main reason for the exclusion was the potential lack of availability of good and timely data in the areas of mental health and disability services.  Given that ongoing work was being carried out in these areas and in light of the timescale for the project, it was felt it was better to focus on acute primary care and social care services.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second point was related to the resources included in the primary care part of the study.  As he pointed out, we picked up on GPs, nurses and some of the allied health professionals in the study because of the availability of relatively good data for the numbers of resources in these areas and the activities undertaken by these professionals.  The data in question were broken down on a granular level in terms of the patients they were seeing.  This meant that we could do our demand forecasting on the same basis as the other parts of the modelling.  I would not expect the addition of additional resources to have an impact on the results achieved on the basis of the resources included in the report.  The inclusion of other resources in the outputs would give a further richness to the report.  By including other primary care resources in the modelling, we would see the impact on them.  It would not have a significant impact on the resources already included in the review.  We are relatively confident that the resources at which we have looked would be taken into account in the modelling.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a particular question about the over 65s.  The second scenario we set out focused on the elderly cohort of patients and particularly the chronic conditions suffered by such patients.  Essentially, we analysed whether we had missed the impact on those under the age of 65 years.  As a baseline, we looked at primary care services across all three sectors and patients of all ages.  This ensured the total population was included.  Our analysis was not limited to those over the age of 65 years.  As has been pointed out, the particular scenario we considered looked at changes in the model of care for patients over the age of 65 years.  There were two reasons for this.  First, given that the main impact of this scenario would be on the over-65 years population, we felt that by considering them we would cover the main impacts on chronic conditions of changes in primary care services.  Second, we wanted to enable the scenarios to be added together.  When we were looking at improvements in hospitals in the third scenario - the efficiency scenarios in hospitals and hospital systems - we mainly looked at people under the age of 65 years.  This meant that when we were adding the scenarios at the end of the report and looking at their combined effect on the baseline, we could be confident that we were not double-counting impacts from overlapping scenarios.  By ensuring the combination of the three scenarios could be additive and, therefore, their combined impact could be seen, we could deliver a simpler story and message at the end of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Chris Nightingale"},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I will repeat my main question for the purposes of clarity.

What assumptions are made in the two future scenarios?  Is it assumed in either scenario, as per the Sl&aacute;intecare report, that acute primary care essentially will become free at the point of use for everybody?

I fully understand the questions and their thrust.  As we work from where we are to getting a comprehensive solution, we need to put a few building blocks in place to develop a more sophisticated analysis.  Doing an overview of capacity needs based on an assessment of the demand and the trends of the demand is the right first step.  As I indicated in the opening statement, that sets out a landscape around which we go.  It is not that we have then not done a workforce assessment.  Why do we think it is the right landscape to go for?  We know we have not modelled all the workforce in detail and we have set out very clearly a recommendation that a comprehensive workforce assessment is needed.  As we worked up the scenarios, we pulled together workshops with a number of very senior people from across the system.  These were not just system leaders but representatives from patient bodies and the like.  We worked through with them the scenario in reality and what it means for Ireland.  We looked at what is a reasonable quantification for the scenario.  The way we constructed those takes account of people's views of what they think was deliverable, knowing that what we are giving is a broad order assessment of what is needed.<\/p> <p>  Both ends of the spectrum are pretty horrendous in terms of implications.  Members have already pointed out the business of how long it takes to build a hospital.  One asked a question specifically about expert opinion on there being too many beds.  That was a view put forward by one of the members of the OECD panel and the view was that other countries are not building beds.  When we considered it with the other members of the international peer review group, we saw that those countries that are beginning to get away with fewer beds than recommended have already done significant reform in their primary and community care and are already supporting patients in different ways.  Given where Ireland is, it is a reasonable capacity assessment.  Given the time and difficulty in bringing in capital infrastructure, one that looks to the minimum one can get away with is the best.<\/p> <p>  This leaves us with profound questions about how to get capacity and how to address the fair deal question, for example.  It is about how to build that capacity in Ireland and the mechanisms for doing that.  We have not looked at that in detail.  As I stated, we have had some expert opinions from people across the system who have helped to shape those scenarios.  The next stage is to look at that in detail.  If we contrast the 2007 review with this one, in financial terms this iteration poses many more revenue and expenditure questions than were ever posed in the 2007 review.  It puts on the table a much more comprehensive financial view of the scale likely to be needed.  As I said, there are two extremes and perhaps the achievable goal will be somewhere in between.  We think it will be closer to the reforms scenario option than the building option as we go on.  Does that help to answer those questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis"},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>To be frank, it does not answer the matter of workforce planning.

We can take the report as what it is but as regards it being a contribution to the overall process, having sat for 11 months to produce the Sl&aacute;intecare report, it will not have a significant impact because it is corrupted.  Our issues in this regard revolve around having the people to do the work in the first place that dictate decision making, strategies and pathways and that is not part of this review.<\/p> <p>  With regard to reform options, are there any silver bullets?  Do any issues jump out to help deliver the capacity needed?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the issue of the community healthcare organisation, CHOs. and hospital groups.  We spent a great deal of time on this for Sl&aacute;intecare.  This issue is bonkers.  How much would the representatives dial up that issue?  What solutions can be provided quickly?<\/p> <p>  On the alignment of the report with Sl&aacute;intecare, do significant issues jump out that are contradictory?<\/p> <p>  There are demographic challenges in the context of future capacity but are there other infrastructural challenges that are not obvious?  In particular, are there are geographical issues that jump off the page but which perhaps do not appear to those who are close to delivering health services?

It is something that puzzles me about the healthcare system.  The capacity review says that even to get to an 85% occupancy rate, 1,300 new beds are needed, which is a huge number.  The international benchmarking chapter on page 16 of the main report, which is useful, shows that we have a younger population and, therefore, currently, we should need less of everything in healthcare <i>per capita<\/i>, except perhaps maternity care.  According to the resourcing figures, which have been benchmarked against good healthcare systems such as Australia, Norway, Sweden and New Zealand - these are best in class and not OECD averages - we have approximately the same number of GPs, nurses and hospital beds <i>per capita<\/i>but we have a younger population and, therefore, we should need fewer.  At the same time, we are experiencing poor healthcare outcomes comparatively and the capacity review says that even today, a huge number of new beds are needed.  Those two outcomes do not intuitively tie together.  Will the witnesses explain why, if we need less <i>per capita<\/i>and technically we have more GPs, nurses and beds than we should need relative to some of the best healthcare systems in the world, the capacity review has found that we have much less than we need?

We ask the HSE many questions and while I would dearly love to say we get many answers, sometimes we do not.  We have had trouble getting information on activities, for example, the number of operations performed in theatres, or basic information such as whether the theatre is open.  Where did the witnesses obtain the data?  To whom did they speak?  Where the resource data come from and to what do they refer?<\/p> <p>  The 2007 capacity review was undertaken by the witnesses' company.  According to that, there were 11,660 beds.  By 2016, this number had reduced to 10,500, which is a reduction of 1,160.  Where did all the beds go?  Are they in the system?  Are they on wards that are closed?  We did not experience significant hospital closures.  Where are those beds?  What hospitals are they in?  What type of beds are they?  When I saw that figure, it threw me.<\/p> <p>  It is lost on me why workforce planning would not have been included in this review because all the beds in the world could be opened but if the staff members are not available to provide care, they are not much use.  I am worried that workforce planning was explicitly excluded because in 2007 it was part of the review.  At the time, I was part of the working time directive compliance implementation group and we had an expert group on skills mix which recommended an 80:20 ratio for nurses and healthcare assistants.<\/p><p>I wonder if that has been factored in to some of the witnesses' thinking.

Depending on how one looks at it, different numbers can come up.  It strikes me as odd that this will not be included and it is very worrying that workforce, skills mix and future planning are not part of it.  We do not just have an issue with recruitment and retention in our acute hospitals but have them across the board.  We also have an ageing GP population, which will further complicate matters.  I am aware that health service staff have been reformed to death so I hesitate to use the word \"reform\" but without the workforce the reforms will not happen and we will not enhance bed capacity without an adequate skills mix.

We have modelled capacity to say what is required at CHO level and at hospital group level.  When one does a strategic capacity assessment, some of the specifics are going to get in the way and current performance is related to specifics to some extent.  The international direction of travel is towards population health management, which requires accountable care in the US, for example, and generally requires that, in planning delivery of services, one has a comprehensive view of the hospital, community and social care services which the population will receive so that one can make outcome-based decisions to put resources into different places, so that one gets the effect one wants.  A misalignment of populations has been clear in England recently.  Most of the rest of the UK has population health boundaries but England went away from this and, in the past two years, it has been struggling to realign the governance of the system so that hospitals, primary care and mental health organisations start talking about common populations.  We believe the same challenge will emerge in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  When we worked with the national clinical programmes in Tallaght, one of the issues we saw was the number of different organisations involved in discharges from the hospital, the number of different procedures for discharging and the number of discharge co-ordinators with whom the hospital had to work.  The more fragmented and complex the picture is, the more difficult it is for the system to achieve the level of patient care and the patient experience to which we aspire.  We have modelled capacity needs and there are implications, particularly in the third scenario, for how hospital groups work together and with their catchment areas, community health organisations etc.<\/p> <p>  We are not specifically modelling a scenario to reshape the CHOs so that they are all lined up as there are complex issues in doing that.  However, in getting systems to work together, there is a legal structure.  We need to ask if people are able to work together and can flex budgets.  Hearts and minds will be a factor and we need to ask if people will accept it if things go in different directions.  Certain specialties are delivered in some places and not in others and we have to ask if people will accept such changes in authority in the groups involved.  We agree with the Sl&aacute;intecare report that an alignment is, in principle, a good thing and other systems are, indeed, heading back in that direction.<\/p> <p>  We were asked about challenges we may not have foreseen in the area of future capacity.  We have to model what is sensible to model.  We have looked at challenges in what we call \"non-demographic growth\", which is a technical phrase for things that happen that do not involve people getting bigger and older.  For example, we looked at the trend in day cases and we found that it was a trend that would probably stop, rather than carry on.<\/p><p>There were factors associated with bed blocking, among other issues, which meant that hospitals were performing day cases as an alternative to some of the other surgeries they would probably have preferred to be doing at that time.  We have changed some of those trends.  We can pick up some of the non-demographic growth.  One would anticipate that, over time, medical technology will change, but I do not believe that it will change in a completely transformational way in the next ten to 15 years time.  There will be more personalised medicine on a relatively small scale which might have some implications for capacity at a very detailed level.  There may be a number of gene and cell therapy clean rooms, some wards, and things like that.  However, at this stage I do not believe, in terms of the level of detail we have provided and the parameters we have provided, that it is sensible to add in any other factor to do that.  That is a sensible basis for planning. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I would sound a note of caution on how we make those international comparisons.

We look at the different counting rules and definitions that different health systems will use for hospital beds or a GP, etc.  Behind these headline indicators there is a raft of other factors within the system that are driving this.  It is not the case that every country has exactly the same health system and that therefore it is possible to make like-for-like comparisons.

The witness may well be correct on the lack of integration.  However, when taking a systems view, it probably does not matter that much.  What does a lack of integration mean?  It means that people are going into acute settings that might have been seen in the community, or people who are going in for referrals to specialists who perhaps could have been seen by a physiotherapist.  We actually appear to have more clinical assets in the primary care settings and more clinical assets in the acute setting, so a lack of integration may suggest that we have people who are going into hospital who perhaps should be staying in the community.

Some of what I say is based on my wider experience of working in the Irish health system.  On the international comparators, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the comparator on activity on page 21 of the report, specifically the average length of stay rates for inpatient acute care.  In Ireland the performance in this area has been declining.  One of the points made about integration is that patient flow is blocked and people get stuck in hospitals, which means that the productivity of the workforce, in OECD terms, declines, so patients do not get as much health care as they might otherwise with that same workforce.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned GPs, which was one of the things that came up in the review.  We very deliberately described a primary care workforce in the review.  The advice from New Zealand was that the mix is currently very GP heavy.  We have not looked specifically at that, but in other areas where we have looked at this question GPs operating alone tended to have different productivity outcomes to GPs working in larger teams where there is a degree of specialisation, for example women's services, diabetes and things like that within the GP community.  In particular, the nurse GP ratio could be looked at.  In New Zealand many general practice tasks are carried out by nurses, with issues escalated to doctors when appropriate.  Nurses are able to carry out many of these tasks.  My understanding is that the Department has put in place a programme for building primary care centres, but is having difficulty attracting GPs to relocate and work from those centres.  We believe that productivity within the system is hampered by some of these workforce factors.  It is also hampered by the lack of integration.  On a practical level, how many different forms have to be filled out and how many different people have to be contacted to move someone on?  That is affected by the fragmentation within the system at present.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland still has a long journey to take in terms of resourcing healthcare.  The way that budgets work does not encourage an output, let alone an outcome, review of what is being achieved.  It is very much an input-based strategy, and things will not change until that approach is altered.  I do not mean changes at a managerial level.  There is a very real sense among clinicians that they understand and own patient outcomes.  They know that the decisions they make every day not to discharge someone from an acute ward condemns someone to an extra stay on a trolley in an emergency department.  Those are risk-based decisions, and they are difficult, but that is the kind of real cultural change that is required across the system.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#L01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>On the public health indicators, yes, Irish people have a long life expectancy, but if one looks at the figures we have on smoking and alcohol consumption it is a different picture.

The person has been discharged from hospital and is living alone.  All the person gets from the public health nurse is a telephone call and there is no follow-up checking.  The person is six weeks out of hospital and is in what I would consider to be a serious enough medical condition, but there is no co-ordination.  No one has written to the public health nurse saying the nurse should call to this person once every week.<\/p> <p>  The consultants have looked at other systems.  This is not an area where we need to invest money.  It is simply about setting up new structural co-ordination.  Did the consultants look at that in the context of delivering far more effective services by the co-ordination of services?<\/p> <p>  I have looked at the set-up in Canada, where GPs go into and work in hospitals.  Some might work two days per week or two half-days per week there.  That is the level of contact.

I hope I will not repeat some of the questions asked before.  If I do, let me know.  Productivity of the workforce was mentioned, as was primary care service being GP-heavy.  The consultants referred to single GPs operating on their own.  When it comes to the geographical situation in Ireland, this is an issue because we have remote parts with low population.  There is need for single GPs to service these communities.  Although I am all for the primary care centre, it simply will not work in certain parts of Ireland.  The consultants spoke to their experience rather than the report.  Has that been considered?<\/p> <p>  Attracting GPs to primary care centres seems to be an issue in Ireland.  We appear to have some good centres set up but getting GPs to come and work in what is a semi-corporate set-up is difficult.  It was always the case that it was integral to a GP's work that she was in charge of her practice and was almost a doctor and a business person in the same way as a pharmacist.  I am a pharmacist by profession.  Is that where PA Consulting Group believes the barrier is?  Is it a question of losing that autonomy?  Do the consultants have any views on that?<\/p> <p>  The consultants spoke about how in other countries nurses are upskilled to do certain jobs and GPs become more specialist.  Do the consultants have any view on the barriers to GPs letting go of certain bread-and-butter practices, for want of a better phrase, that are crucial to keeping a certain baseline revenue coming in to a practice?  I have in mind things like repeat prescriptions for contraceptives.  I firmly believe these can be done in the community pharmacy setting through the Oregon algorithm to make it safe to deal with contraceptive needs of women and men.<\/p> <p>  The consultants spoke about the current stock value.  Will they elaborate a little on the beds we have?  They spoke about isolation rooms.  Will they elaborate on that?  Is it the case that the stock we have is not primary stock?  We may have large numbers of eight-bed wards.  I take it from what the consultants have said that such a set-up might be counter-intuitive because if there is an eight-bed ward and disease is spreading, then it will compound the issue and we will have more admissions.<\/p> <p>  Senator Burke referred to the New Zealand model whereby the GPs go into the hospital.  I was at a hospital in Kilkenny looking at the system in operation there.  To my mind, the system operating there is the way forward.  It is not the solution but it is a partial solution.  It seems bizarre that a GP, who is the anchor to a patient's healthcare, would refer a patient to a hospital and then the patient goes into the same room as another who has broken his leg on the football pitch, even though the first patient has essentially already been triaged by the GP.<\/p> <p>  I imagine the consultants know that in Carlow and Kilkenny a community pharmacist is involved in the discharge process.<\/p><p>The service is more seamless and there are fewer errors.  Have the PA Consulting Group considered that?  In reply to a member, I think it was Deputy Donnelly, it was stated that a consultant leaving somebody in an acute bed for a day longer has repercussions for those on a trolley somewhere.

I was listening to them in the office, although I was not physically present.  One of the issues that concerns me about the health service is the cost-benefit analysis that is done on the decisions that are made.  It is not obvious to me that the cost-benefit analysis on some of the decisions is correct.  This includes some of the decisions to close district hospital beds and so on and the impact that has in the short, medium and long term.  Is it possible for the HSE to supply to the committee secretariat or to members exactly what elements are used in the cost-benefit analysis?  That would help us to understand the decisions.  I do not have confidence in the cost-benefit analysis models that are being used, either to make decisions on the closure of beds or for centralisation of services.  I take the point made about the centralisation of services and the improved outcomes and I would certainly agree with that, but we need to see the sacrifices that are made for that in terms of access to health care services in rural areas and the importance of putting in place services at a local level where it is safe to do so.  We have not done that and have failed dismally to do that.<\/p> <p>  I take it from the accents of the witnesses that they would be very familiar with the NHS in the United Kingdom.  I know that Mr. Stevens was looking at the model of moving away from the centralisation and privatisation model and bringing it back to communities.  We have continued to talk about that for 20 years but we have not put actions behind the words.<\/p> <p>  I cite the most recent decision in respect of the withdrawal of the Versatis plasters from those who have a medical card.  I am not at all satisfied that there was a proper cost-benefit analysis done in reaching that decision, that affected 25,000 people, in terms of the extra hospitalisation, medicines and anti-depressants that were required.  Leaving aside the humanity of the decision, if we are looking at the impact of the decision economically, I do not believe the decision was correct.<\/p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to expand on the question of modelling and how we can have more transparency and accountability around the modelling and adoption of new drugs such as Translarna and the impact that would have.  How can Britain provide free GP care for 60 million people and we cannot do it for 5 million people?  As a person who lived in Britain for a long time and accessed that service, I cannot understand why we cannot do the same.  Will the witnesses give us three primary reasons why they think that we are failing to do the same here?<\/p> <p>  The document provided to us is good, but has the scenario of an all-island approach to the delivery of health care been considered?  In the timeframe 2000 to 2031, there is a growing realisation that we are working towards a united Ireland and an all island approach to services such as health care, education and so on.  It is imperative that those models are being worked out properly in the Department and the HSE, in particular that they would look at the impact of Brexit.  There is much more I could say about primary care in the health service, but I know other members wish to put questions, so I would appreciate a response on those key issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#N00500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway-Walsh.

I do not believe that remark was intended in that way, but the remark could be construed by health service workers as being somewhat dismissive because clearly they are doing their best.  To clarify that remark, will the witnesses outline for us who from the health service workforce, outside of the people whom one would call the management, did they meet?  Did they talk to those on the front line of delivering the services about the challenges they are facing day in, day out, week in and week out, which are all resource dependent?

If a bed is used for one reason, and that is an extra day's stay in bed because somebody is not able to do a ward round, that bed is therefore not available to somebody else.  I agree wholeheartedly with members that the people I have met and talked to across the system want to deliver the best care possible.  Under pressure, they feel the bounds of their world are often much more limited than the whole hospital, so they hold on to beds so that their patients can get into those beds.  They are under pressure for other reasons so they are unable to do the ward rounds that would allow them to get people discharged faster.  There are all sorts of reasons at a human and a practical level.  When capacity is used in a way that looks like it is overused, and the trend of rising average length of stay in Ireland would suggest that, as a whole, the system is behaving in that way, that has an implication.  That is what I was saying.  I would say that.  I would also preface my comments that none of us is a clinician.  A number of the questions we have been asked are actually about clinical decisions, but we are able to look at the impact of clinical decisions system wide and comment on what the sum of those decisions means to the system and, in this context, specifically for capacity.

That means that the number of beds used for the same sorts of issues is higher than in other systems.  I was trying to understand why that is.  It is not because people in Ireland are physiologically different from people in other countries.  It is to do with the way the system works.  I will answer Deputy O'Connell's question while addressing Senator Colm Burke's and give some examples.  Some of this is about the integration of the system and the issues of engagement between hospitals and GPs and between GPs and practice nurses and so on.  We have looked at other systems.  I have worked in other systems, and not just the system of the country from which my accent comes.<\/p> <p>  In terms of returning people to the community out of hospital, in the US there was a behaviour at a system level to reduce the average length of stay continually, which resulted in people getting out of hospital too quickly.  Penalty tariffs were introduced.  In effect, the insurers would no longer pay for a readmission that happened after 30 days.  This had a significant impact in the US.  In England a similar tariff was introduced.  It has not had the same dramatic effect as it had in the US for other reasons, but there was a behavioural driver linked to resource which indicated that if work was given to be done in the community, resources were needed to do that work.  It is not a question of whether people are discharged early.  In the example the Senator gave of someone needing a call, that is extra work for someone's workload.  What is that person's caseload?  Can he or she do that?  Is the resource following the patient?  This is what we mean when we talk about population health.  We mean that when rational decisions are made which say that care is better delivered in community settings, it is not just a matter of getting everyone out of hospital.  The community providers have to be resourced.  We have to recognise that.  Another really good example from the UK was discharge summaries.  The community teams there were unable to do their job because they were not being informed by the hospitals in time.  Again, a system was introduced to get people out.  I think similar initiatives are being worked on in Ireland which will enable hospitals to get discharge summaries out to GPs as effectively.<\/p> <p>  This sort of integrated care involves quite difficult clinical governance issues.  I did some work in Scotland where the system has quite a different structure from that of England.  I was working in a surprisingly remote area.  I will not name it, but it had the equivalent of a model 3 hospital and several model 2 equivalent hospitals.  GPs had admitting rights to the model 2 hospitals.  It was found that people from remote rural communities were being sent to the model 3 hospital, often for diagnostic tests, and were being admitted to older wards and being held on to.  Why was this happening?  It was because the consultants in the hospitals did not think that the GPs would have the time or the facilities to look after the patients at risk properly.  They started to work on a different model of clinical governance whereby people could be stepped down into the model 2 equivalent hospitals while still under the consultant and in which there was an information system that allowed the consultant to keep an eye on the patient.  It was particularly used for cases of sepsis.  The sepsis teams were still able to give that service to the model 2 hospitals and the model 2 hospitals were a safe and effective place for patients to be.  Evidence was coming out that people who were returned to that type of model 2 hospital, which had community rooms and so on, actually returned home faster than if they had been recuperating in a ward in the model 3 fully acute hospital.  The hospitals worked on that model.  That is an example of how it is not just about providing the capacity or giving some good policy.  There is a lot of clinical governance and detailed work involved and the way that resources move around the system needs to work for this to work effectively in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. George MacGinnis"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524038400,"counter":132,"content":"<p>On the cost-benefit analysis side, I cannot speak for what the HSE has used, but I can offer a view on the common factors we generally see health systems considering when they are involved in service change.  Such changes can range from very centralised surgery services down to more localised services such as the ones we have been involved in which have included the use of telecare or telehealth locally to help shift out care and different ways in which paramedics and ambulances can contribute to the system.  I would highlight six factors which generally come up.  The first is about quality.  Underneath that there are the clinical outcomes, the patient experience and patient safety.  What impact will a given change, be it a service change or a policy, procedural or regulatory change, have?  The second factor is access.  In the questions the committee has raised, we have spoken about what a change means for remote communities.  Some services need to be very local, others need clinical volumes to get good outcomes.  Another factor is the workforce.  We have discussed that.  Part of that workforce factor is the education and training requirements.  The junior doctors, trainee nurses and allied health professionals need to see the right amount of patients in order to train.  The productivity of a training establishment will be different and a system needs to reflect that.<\/p> <p>  The fifth factor relates to the financial side and the net present value.  However, that is, as the committee can see, one of six factors.  The final factor is deliverability.  We have spoken about the next steps and feasibility.  Whether it is a massive building programme or a big requirement to train up and create a workforce, how it will be delivered must be considered.  That is just at a national level but it is equally applicable at a local level if a GP-led health centre or a more local hospital is being set up.  It must be considered whether it can be practically delivered in terms of infrastructure, IT, estate, timing and such things.  Those are the six factors that repeatedly come up.  Then there will always be, depending on the level at which it is being done, particular local issues.  There may be a particular issue around health inequalities in a particular area which needs to be addressed.  This would mean that provision in that area would be designed slightly differently.  That would be our general view of the cost-benefit analysis but, as I have said, we cannot speak to exactly what the HSE would use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018041800002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1524038400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>What is difficult to understand is how a cost-benefit analysis, CBA, in the North, which is just a few miles up the road, can deliver something like Versatis or Translarna while a CBA here can say that it is not viable.

Based on local populations, different decisions have been arrived at from those in England.  That is really a question on eligibility for the authorities here.

That is a detail.  It would be for people to make a clear, clinical, economic and welfare judgment on the cases presented.  The two systems North and South are clearly very different.

I was there at the time of A Vision for Change.  I am led to believe that people can be waiting up to three weeks for a standard GP appointment.

The cost of Versatis patches for one year here was going to be &euro;36 million.  That was the same cost projected for the whole UK population for the same time.

There is stuff that needs to be done at home by home care packages and by clinicians.  There is also stuff that needs to be done out of hospital.  There is a question as to whether that is done in a GP practice or whether that practice is part of a health centre or whether it is done by practice nurses, pharmacists or a whole range of professionals.  The NHS is looking at how one might disaggregate and define that care which is between what one historically would have thought of as default GP care and the referral to a consultant in a hospital.

It was considered in scenario two as well.  The Department was keen not to benchmark that against international comparators.  Rather, it was keen to look within the Irish system at the length of stay.  It was benchmarked against best performance internally.  We looked at the median across all of the hospitals within age category and speciality.  We asked what would happen if everybody got to the median level?  For those at median, what would happen if we got to a 25th percentile?  The answer was there would be some improvement over five years.  That was felt by the steering group to be a reasonable improvement in length of stay.  It was not a case of saying let us get to the position in Finland or Australia.  It was to get to the best practice currently in Ireland.  It was likewise with levels of allied health professionals, AHPs, and CHOs.

I welcome quite a number of our members who are present in the Gallery, particularly representatives of ISME, Motorsport Ireland,  Playcentres Ireland, Ireland Active, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, RGDATA and the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland.   Their attendance here is a measure of the intensity with which they feel these issues and the way they affect their operations.<\/p> <p>  Members have already received a copy of our submission.  Therefore, I will not go through it all but will summarise its key points.  The Alliance for Insurance Reform brings together representative bodies from the not-for-profit charity, sports and small and medium size business sectors across Ireland, representing more than 35,000 organisations, more than 633,000 employees and more than 41,000 volunteers to demand rapid action to end crippling insurance costs.<\/p><p>The creation of the alliance is a response to countless stories from small organisations where services and jobs are being affected by excessive insurance premiums, both liability and motor.  Members will have heard many such stories, but there is a considerable fear among many organisations which are afraid to go public on their experiences because they are at the mercy of one underwriter or afraid to draw additional claims on themselves.  What members are hearing is only the tip of the iceberg.However, we will not focus on the stories but analysis and solutions. <br\/><br\/>Our approach to insurance in Ireland is at a turning point.  The system is dysfunctional to the extent that what is supposed to be a service industry that facilitates the operation of society has become an extractive industry, taking over &euro;2 billion in motor and liability insurance premiums annually.  It is protected and often made compulsory by the State and so expensive that it threatens the viability of many organisations that form the backbone of the nation. <br\/><br\/>A survey of 950 organisations within the alliance, carried out by Am&aacute;rach Research in January, found that since 2013, nearly half of respondents had seen their premiums rise by over 30%, while over one fifth had seen rises of over 70%.  This was in the broader context of a consumer price index increase of 0.9% in the same period.  Two thirds of respondents also reported having increased excesses or new exclusions added to their policies, an equally damaging trend that severely restricts the ability of organisations to develop and creates additional exposure to cost.  <br\/><br\/>Critically, 45% of respondents cited insurance as a threat to the future of their organisation, yet our members believe the insurance industry and the legal profession have the strongest voices in the corridors of power.  Policyholders believe we have no voice.  This is amplified by last week's Collins Institute report for Fine Gael which concluded that the Central Bank, the State institution charged with protecting insurance policyholders, was too focused on the needs of the financial services industry.  There is much activity in the area, but our concern is that a lot will be discussed and that little will be done as it is not in the interests of the insurance companies or lawyers operating in this market for anything to change.  If we were them, we would huff and puff in a show of empathy with our customers, but we would fight tooth and nail to stop real change.  We would cite issues arising from the Constitution, data protection or competition, suggest self-regulation, agree to protocols, ease off on aggressive profit-taking for a while until the fuss died down and string out the debate to the next general election; anything to stop real reform. <br\/><br\/>In the last six weeks we have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy, and his officials, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Personal Injuries Commission, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and it is clear that many elements of the work of the cost of insurance working group are grinding to a halt, with the dead hand of vested interests evident.  The buck stops firmly with policymakers.  The actions we are suggesting are in the areas of prevention, consistency and transparency.  We believe them to be just, proportionate, feasible, achievable within a limited timeframe and, ultimately, effective.  The following are practical ways to solve the insurance crisis which we hope the committee will consider and support.<br\/><br\/>On prevention, to quote a member of the audience at a public meeting we held in Cork in February, &quot;If I had a need for big money and I had a choice between robbing a bank and faking an injury, I'd pick the fake injury every day.  More money and no consequences if I'm found out.&quot;  We absolutely acknowledge the right of genuine claimants to fair compensation, but people have accidents all over the world; it is the consequences for Irish policyholders that appear unique.  We are suggesting four actions in this area.  <br\/><br\/>First, we call for sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to be linked.  We want an amendment to the Act such that if a case is dismissed under section 26 because the plaintiff knowingly gives or adduces evidence that is false or misleading, it would automatically be<i><\/i>referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for prosecution under section 25, which would penalise such an offence with a substantial fine or imprisonment or both unless a defendant deliberately falsely accused a plaintiff of giving such evidence.  <br\/><br\/>Second, we seek the establishment of a Garda insurance fraud unit. <b><i><\/i><\/b>The cost of insurance working group's motor insurance reports promised a dedicated Garda unit to focus exclusively on the investigation of insurance fraud.  We want the unit to be established as a matter of urgency.  The Minister has told us that there is not enough support in the House for it.  If that is the case, we urge opposing parties to clarify their concerns and remove the blockages. <br\/><br\/>Third, we seek the regulation of claims management companies, also known as claims harvesters.  Our members tell us that claim harvesting websites are acting as the ambulance chasers of old, pursuing potential claimants with promises of money to be made, regardless of how dubious the claim and with no costs or consequences.  They are adding fuel to the fire of fraudulent, exaggerated and misleading claims and must be regulated by the State to protect policyholders and society as a whole.  In particular, referral fees they might charge to refer live cases to solicitors must be banned outright.  Regulation, registration and a ban on referral fees would only bring Ireland into line with the regime in place in the United Kingdom since 2007.  It is not sufficient for the Government to pass this onto the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which is still in the process of establishing itself.  Regulation must be brought forward now. <br\/><br\/>Fourth, we want sections 7 and 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to be amended.  First, in section 7, we call for the period in respect of the Statute of Limitations on personal injury claims to be reduced from two years to one year.  As the average period for a claim to be registered with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board following an accident is nine and a half months, this would not disadvantage claimants.  Second, the language used in section 8 which purports to oblige a plaintiff to inform a defendant of an incident within two months is so conditional as to be useless and ignored in our experience.  We ask that it be tightened in order that judges would have to take into account any delay in notification before allowing a case to proceed.  The Department of Finance has stated it is pursuing this issue with the Department of Justice and Equality, but we want it done urgently.<br\/><br\/>On consistency, the general damages awarded in Ireland for minor injuries bear no relation to those awarded in other countries, which makes Ireland a very attractive place to have a minor accident.  Furthermore, there is no consistency within the jurisdiction in awards for identical injuries, which makes it very attractive in personal injury cases to reject a PIAB offer and head for the courts, safe in the knowledge that with the right judge, the rewards may be substantially better.  We seek two reforms in this area, the first of which is that the approach to calculating the book of quantum be changed.  The Court of Appeal has established that the ceiling on general damages for catastrophic injuries is &euro;450,000.  It has also established that the concepts of common sense and proportionality are central to the principles of proper compensation.  We call for a revised book of quantum calculated on that percentage disability basis as a matter of urgency through the Personal Injuries Commission which is only looking at solutions in the case of motor whiplash claims.  The Government should extend its remit to all injuries immediately.  Next we encourage consistency among the judiciary.<b><i><\/i><\/b>The 2004 Civil Liability and Courts Act should be amended to require judges who award damages in excess of the book of quantum for general damages to set out a detailed reasoning for so doing.<br\/><br\/>On transparency, the insurance industry is of systemic importance to the proper functioning of Irish society and enshrined as such in much legislation and regulations, yet there is virtually no transparency in the market, either at industry or individual policyholder level.  We demand that control of analysis and reporting of the new national claims information database be given to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, rather than the Central Bank, as envisaged by the cost of insurance working group.  The PIAB has the expertise and funding necessary and no additional legislation would be required as sections 54 and 55 of the PIAB Act of 2003 already allow for this function.  We ask that the blue book be reinstated immediately and enhanced in order to restore the only transparency there was in the market before the Central Bank discontinued it in 2016.  <br\/><br\/>We want to scrap and revisit the agreed large increases protocol.  The very first recommendation in the report of the cost of insurance working group on motor insurance was that insurers set out for customers the reasons for large increases in premiums.<\/p><p>The protocol produced from this recommendation was one of the first actions to be ticked as completed in the CIWG updates.  However, the protocol agreed between the Department of Finance and the insurance industry which I have linked with the submission is a good example of how the cost of insurance working group is being strangled.  We would be better off without it as it only creates the impression that something has been achieved when it has not.  We want a meaningful protocol agreed to for both motor and liability insurance policyholders that individualises explanations, with clear calculations showing the basis of premium charges.<\/p><p> We seek the reinstatement of the 2003 insurance industry-IBEC protocol for dealing with claims.  Almost one year was spent by the Department of Finance and Insurance Ireland talking in circles about a protocol for notifying policyholders about the progress of claims against them before the Department discovered a pre-existing protocol agreed to by Insurance Ireland's predecessor, the IIF, and IBEC in 2003.  The insurance industry is resisting it being implemented anew.  We demand that it be implemented immediately, backed by legislation, for both the motor insurance and liability insurance sectors.  A copy of the protocol is attached in Appendix 3.<\/p><p> As an alliance, we have put a great deal of work into addressing this crucial issue for our members and their employees and volunteers.  We hope the committee can help us in ensuring action.  We are happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524054600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Boland who reiterated what he said on radio earlier.

The doubling of my insurance premium three years in a row was part of the decision we decided not to open the new premises.  My current premium could have increased to &euro;200,000 this year.

Because of the increased costs, the organisation has had to cut services and reduce its workforce.  It is paying more for insurance cover than for petrol.  It has had a big impact on services.  From the perspective of charitable organisations that have to raise funds to pay additional insurance costs, it is a big challenge to fundraise for services without being lumped with this additional overhead.

It has a prudential role which always seems to receive priority and a consumer protection role which appears to be ignored.  As one of the Deputy's colleagues said at a meeting of another committee a few weeks ago, the bank is a dog that does not bark, never mind bite when it comes to customer protection.  We would strenuously object to the bank taking on that role.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the information not being supplied, the simplest reform the Government could implement is to tell the Cental Bank to reinstate the blue book.  The blue book was a set of industry data which, while not perfect, gave an overview of what was going on in the industry and a sense of profitability.  Profitability is complex in the insurance industry and can only be interpreted over a number of years, if not a decade, because of claim trends and other issues.  However, the blue book provided clarity, but the Central Bank summarily cut it and 2015 is that last year for which data are available.  The blue book has been replaced by a set of Solvency II data which are unintelligible, even to actuaries, and of no use from a consumer point of view.  From claims up, all of the data are available.  The PIAB collects the data constantly because all claims must initially go to it.  It is a matter of collating the data and reporting on them, as the PIAB is well placed to do so.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the question about the three actions the Government should take.  The actions we have suggested are granular and defined enough to be acted on because there are different people who could act on each.  If the Deputy wanted something to be done before close of play this evening, I suggest the establishment of a Garda insurance fraud unit.  Garda&iacute; had reached the stage where they had met their colleagues in the United Kingdom where they looked at a similar unit, but that initiative seems to have shuddered to a halt<\/p><p>Everybody is in agreement that it makes sense so we are not entirely sure why it has shuddered to a halt.  That would be number one.<\/p><p> Number two would be asking the Judiciary to express why judges are going beyond the book of quantum in the context of general damages.  I want to emphasise here that we are always looking at protecting the plaintiff on this, so we are not talking about special damages, which are for loss of earnings or other expenses.  We are talking about very specific general damages which apply in cases of injury.  They are measured in the book of quantum but they are constantly being overruled in the courts.  We cannot and do not want to interfere with the role of the Judiciary in this country but we want an explanation when the book of quantum is breached.<\/p><p> The Insurance Ireland-IBEC protocol on dealing with claims is absolutely dogging the entire small and medium enterprise sector at the moment.  Ms Reid will probably say the same in a moment.  I refer to claims are being settled without any consultation with policyholders.  It is a matter of natural justice and it is creating a fog in this area, which makes it very difficult to find out what is going on because there is so little transparency on the part of the insurance companies.  The protocol is there.  It has been properly parsed and written.  I assume it has been legally vetted because it was signed off and agreed by Insurance Ireland's predecessor in 2003.  It is just a matter of them getting off their asses, if members will excuse my expression, and implementing it again because nothing has changed between then and now that might bar us from using it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524054600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I will return to the issue of transparency for a moment.

It was good to listen to their presentation.  I congratulate them on setting up the group and on coming before us to engage in respect of this issue.  When one is trying to run a business, one has enough things to do in terms of one's shopfront or backyard without having to lobby or advocate for changes in legislation.  I understand that the frustration they experienced led the witnesses to this point.  The same is true of those in the Gallery.  I read with interest about the number of stakeholders and component groups involved in the alliance; it is quite a significant body that is represented.  It great to have the group before us.<\/p> <p>  The points addressed in the presentation all appear to be very sound and reasonable.  Is it a ten-point plan?  I hope we can progress the points in some shape or form, either at the committee or in the Houses, because they make a lot of sense.<\/p> <p>  I wish to inquire about a couple of matters.  Reference was made - I have read details of this elsewhere - to sums being paid out in respect of minor injuries and other incidents without being challenged and even without the knowledge of policyholders.  Ms Reid spoke about such a case.  People representing businesses and employment agencies have come to see me at my constituency office to discuss workplace accidents whereby an employee is allegedly injured and when a claim comes in the insurer often settles it without contesting matters or ascertaining the details of who did what.  Employers often say that claims are trumped up and that they did not get their day in court or anywhere else - such as at an employment tribunal or other forum - in order that they could trash matters out.  They often say that if they were given the choice, they would have fought it tooth and nail.  However, they do not get a choice because their insurers just pay out and if they query the matter, the insurer says that is the way it is and there is nothing to do about it but pay the premium the following year.  Insurers say that is how they do business.  That is extremely frustrating.  Business owners have come to me with such cases and I will be interested to hear the experience of the witnesses in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps that comes under the point relating to the claims management companies.  I have heard from people locally that there are websites and hotlines - offered through the medium of a variety of languages - people can ring in order to report accidents at work and the companies involved will chase the claims on their behalf.  Such companies encourage or vet the process, which is unhelpful to say the least to the premium payer.<\/p> <p>  My final point correlates to all that I have just said.  I noticed that much of the documentation provided refers to rising legal costs.  I appreciate that this is a factor.  I will put my hand up and say that I am a lawyer, but I do not speak for the legal industry - far from it.  I am not practising at present but I hear from colleagues.  Does the issue go back to insurers?  I am interested to find out if the supposition is correct that the lawyers are creaming it and that legal costs are driving up costs overall.  Colleagues who are practising tell me that since the PIAB was set up and insurers began to do the work in-house, there is very little work for them because there is not much litigation in view of the fact that many cases do not go to trial.  Barristers find that they are not weighed down with injury cases coming their way.  In fact, they say it is all going to PIAB or what is increasingly more common is that insurers say they will settle and that is the end of the story.  That seems to be the big problem, namely, the lack of counter challenge whether it is in the courts or through an employer having his or her say or having some forum that can hear both sides of the case.  The question is how it is even cost effective for the insurers to be doing that.  Perhaps the answer is that they are ripping off the person who pays the premium and that is how it is cost effective, but it just seems that if that challenge was there it might be one solution to the problem.  I would be interested to hear the views of witnesses on what I have said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#E00400","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I will have a stab at responding to that question if I may.  Reference was made to the prevention of claims but in fact the PIAB only handles 10% of the claims and something like 20% of them make it to court.  I might not be correct in my statistics but up to 80% of cases are settled in between.  In my personal case my understanding is that insurance companies are reluctant to defend, first, because of the costs of defending cases.  We raised that under the heading of consistency.  When cases go to court the judgments seem to be quite random.  There seems to be a lack of consistency in judgments.  Again, insurance companies are very reluctant to go to court because it costs so much.  That is one of the reasons they push for settlements.  That is what happened in our case, whereby the insurer pushed to settle rather than defending.  Even though the company felt there was a case to defend it was very reluctant to go to court because of the costs.<\/p> <p>  The other issue in addition to prevention is that when a case gets to court even if the insurer wins the case it is very rare that the costs will follow the plaintiff.  It is generally defendants who seem to have the costs awarded to them.  Again, it is one of the reasons we said we would really like to see a change.  I am sorry if I am getting my sections mixed up but I think it is in section 26 that where a judge dismisses a case, it is just dismissed but nothing happens and the person walks away.  That is why we are looking for an automatic referral under section 25 that the Garda would get involved and there would be a prosecution.  We have to start preventing such claims.  If someone hurts himself or herself on my premises, I, as a businessman, want to look after that person but I am afraid to do anything because he or she could claim for &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000 for hurting a finger.  It is bizarre because the cost of the claim could be relatively small.  When one starts to add in all the costs, however, it gets out of control and that is reflected in my premium.  The system is very dysfunctional and, as a layperson, it is very hard to understand what is going on.  We certainly need to prevent those kind of small, misleading - not necessarily fraudulent - but exaggerated claims.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin McCambridge"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>If I could add to that, I had a discussion with an acquaintance in the legal profession last night about this whole area.  I understand the reluctance of insurance companies to go to court because it is a bit of a lottery.  That is not to be sympathetic to them in any way, shape or form because they have a lot to answer for in this area, but it is certainly the case that the gentleman I had the discussion with could only think of one case in recent case law where anybody was prosecuted under section 25 of the Civil Liability Act, and that was back in 2012.<\/p><p>The legislation is there but the way in which it is structured does not act as a deterrent for people who are intent on making exaggerated or misleading claims.<\/p><p> Going back to Deputy Lawless's comments on the issue of legal costs, we have not focused on legal costs to any great extent because we do not want this to turn into a blame game.  To be honest, we have felt that much of the debate on this in recent years has been very unsophisticated in that the vested interests take a position and point their guns at the opposition.  There has, between the legal profession and the insurance companies in particular, been a lot of \"It's your fault.  No, it's your fault.\"  We say that everyone involved in this, particularly those making money out of it, have a responsibility to address it.  What is different now is that it is unsustainable.  Businesses, charities and voluntary groups were able to handle the increases for a number of years, but it has gone past that point now and we are looking at a much broader issue.  This is why we are not a business-based organisation any more, because this is a societal threat.  The consequences of what is happening at present are that schools will not be able to allow kids to exercise in the schoolyards, it will not be possible to build additional community playgrounds, Montessoris will have to close because of the excesses and conditions on them, voluntary clubs will be restricted in what they can do, charities will not be able to provide the services they have been able to provide and society as a whole will shrink.  That is what we are looking at.  We want to avoid this bashing back and forth and actually get some action because we fear that an awful lot of what is being done at present consists of long-term processes aimed at solving an urgent problem, and that is of no use to our members.  That is why the ten items we have listed, we feel, can be addressed before the summer recess, never mind by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1524054600,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I wish to add a word of support to that.

It should be noted that this is a very complicated terrain, as I am sure we are all aware, and it is difficult to understand the dynamics of what is going on.  It is a challenge.

Do we have figures for the number of cases that were dismissed under section 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004?  Are they available publicly?  Mr. Boland said that only one or two referred prosecutions have taken place under section 25 of the same Act.  In the context of the next appointee, the Alliance for Insurance Reform recommends the establishment of a Garda insurance fraud unit.  Mr. Boland said, \"The Minister has told us that there is not enough support in the House for this.\"  It was a recommendation of the group.  What I am trying to get at is why there is not enough support.  How have we tested that support, just as a matter of interest?  I am new to this committee; I had spent the past seven years on another committee.  Why is there no support?  Was there a motion before the House?  Was there a debate in the D&aacute;il?  How has the support of the D&aacute;il been assessed as to whether the establishment of a Garda insurance fraud unit would pass muster?  I ask Mr. Boland to elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  Moving to the other issue I wish to raise, there is no doubt, in my experience, that people put up fierce resistance to change if money is involved.  There is no doubt but that there are huge sums at stake here in the context of the legal profession, the insurance companies and other vested interests.  That is a fact.  The Central Bank, of course, is a prudential overseer of the insurance market and has a prudential obligation to ensure that we have a functioning insurance market.  Equally, we have cases in which insurance companies went wallop and left people without any form of compensation.  It is a matter of getting that balance right.  Equally, other organisations come before us expressing exasperation at that fact.  When Mr. Boland says that the Central Bank has prudential duties, where does he see this role?

I will get to that.  We are talking about things that will have an impact immediately.  In the longer term, there is definitely a case for a separate body to oversee all of the financial sector in terms of consumer advocacy.  I am not the first to bring that to the table; that has been mentioned regularly.  We are all involved in small businesses and small enterprises and we are not great fans of additional oversight and bureaucracy.  However, we cannot understand how the Central Bank can have that prudential role and a consumer protection role at the same time.  They are mutually exclusive.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the lack of support, I think three of us who are here today were at that meeting with the Minister.  We were told there was a lack of support for the proposal.  It was not clarified on what basis that support was lacking, but we were told there was a lack of support.  We were very disappointed by that because everything we had read from the cost of insurance working group would have suggested that everyone was gung ho on the idea and that it was going forward.  However, it seems to have been parked for now and we would be very anxious to get it back in place.  Regarding costs, it had already been agreed by Insurance Ireland that it would fund that unit, so the cost to the taxpayer would have been negligible.<\/p> <p>  As we understand it, and according to my legal contact last night, we can find only one case of a prosecution under section 25.  Regarding section 26, I know there are numbers in the cost of insurance working group report.  Up to this year, I think, it has been very low, certainly in the low teens, as I understand it, but we have seen an acceleration in the number of cases being dismissed under section 26 in recent months, and there have been headlines about that in the newspapers.  The one thing we cannot get over is that someone who has been found by the court to make a misleading or exaggerated claim - and often that is putting it politely - is then able to walk out of court scot-free, with no consequences, and in a position to do something similar again some time down the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Boland"},{"type":"speech","time":1524054600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Copy that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018041800002#F01300","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speech","time":1524054600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I reiterate that Deputy Neville was very keen to be here today for this but he is also Fine Gael's lead speaker on mental health and is on the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, so there has been a clash.  He was here for the quorum at the start of the meeting to enable it to begin.  I just wanted to put that on the record because, like Deputy Quinlivan said, this is an area in which Deputy Neville is particularly interested.  I am also very interested in it because being a GP means running a small business, and owning a shopping centre has all the problems the witnesses have outlined.  However, I am very interested in it from the point of view of the consumer and the Government.  I really welcome the witnesses, the presentations they have made and the document they have given us because they have very clear, concise, reasonable suggestions, some of which I wish to discuss with them because I want to see what the blockage is.<\/p> <p>  I have heard very clearly what they have said and I agree with them 100%: where vexations complaints are made, there must be consequences for those who go beyond vexatious to fraudulent, and let us call a spade a spade.  We want to ensure that any citizen who is injured and is entitled to compensation gets it, but it should be reasonable and proportionate.<\/p><p>The comments regarding putting in place legislation that would put an onus on members of the Judiciary to explain the reason they have departed from the book of quantum in terms of an award make perfect sense and I hope they would not see issue with that.  Nobody wants to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary or the individual case because all cases are different but, at the same time, an explanation would be welcome.<\/p><p> I refer to some of the comments made.  The witnesses have given us some anecdotes, including Mr. McCambridge of McCambridge's in Galway, with which I am very familiar, my wife being from Galway, but they are anecdotes.  It would be very useful if there was some study done that gave evidence to the fact that X number have not been able to expand and Y number of jobs have been lost.  On many occasions in the voluntary sector, I have seen people who have not been able to set up facilities, perform a service or even run an event because of insurance costs.  There is no question about that.  I welcome, and I will continue to say this, that the witnesses have given us some clear suggestions.  The suggestion on the Garda fraud unit makes absolute sense to me.  There must be consequences for those who commit fraud.  <\/p><p> I do not know what issues we will face in terms of whether there should be an automatic referral between section 26 and section 25 but nonetheless we must explore that to identify the problems.<\/p><p> I want to discuss regulation of the claims management companies.  Mr. Boland stated this had been done in the United Kingdom in 2007.  Have the witnesses been given a rationale for the absence of such regulation?  Have they been told the reason we do not have such regulation or what the blockages are in that respect?<\/p><p> Regarding the legal costs, there is no doubt, as the witnesses have acknowledged, that very often insurers will not go to court because it is cheaper to settle the claim.  That is a problem but it possibly would not be as much of a problem if there was a consequence for those who made false claims.  The insurance company could then set about clarifying what happens to people when they do make false claims.  As a doctor, I see the other side of this in my surgery with people who have been injured but I have also had experiences, and I am not getting into the blame game, of where I have been instructed by \"the lawyer\" representing the client to refer them to a particular consultant, which I will always put in the report because I do not believe that is appropriate.  It is a particular problem for cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities also.  We want children to play in a normal environment outside, get dirty and allow them graze their knees.  That is the reality of life and to put in place anything that would block that seems detrimental to me.<\/p><p> All I ask of the witnesses is for them to identify the problems as to the reason the blue book has not been reinstated, particularly the 2003 IBEC-IIF protocol.  Have they had discussions with the Minister or the Department on that and, if so, what has been their response as to the reason that has not happened?  I will be very supportive of many of the issues the witnesses have raised today and will pursue them with the Ministers and the Departments relevant to them.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses have any thoughts on the need to have a policyholder advocacy office, as raised by Deputy Kelleher, in terms of consumer protection in the future?

The cost of insurance working group, CIWG, report is written in very parliamentary or diplomatic language, for want of a better word, but I get the impression from reading it that there was quite a bit of frustration in the Department of Finance when it turned out that a protocol already existed which had not been brought to its attention during the initial work on the cost of insurance working group.  It appears now from the fourth quarterly update that the insurance industry is saying that that protocol does exist but it has been superseded by the Central Bank's consumer guidelines.  We have had a good look at the Central Bank consumer guidelines and, to be honest, the contrast is like saying that one no longer needs a driver licence because one has a new membership card for Xtra-Vision.  They are completely separate.  It is completely inappropriate and there is no connection between the two.  The suggestion that the Central Bank guidelines could replace a detailed protocol like the one we have put into our submission is almost farcical.  There is some strong resistance in that regard, but it is only from one side of the coin.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Senator Reilly's question on the blue book, we were told at that meeting that the Central Bank is independent.  The Central Bank made that decision, and that is its decision.

They may well have perfectly valid reasons and we believe if we could see those we would understand better the reason premiums are increasing or what we can do to prevent these issues but as a lay person reading the newspaper, I am not getting a clear picture as to the reason vast amounts of money are being awarded in these cases.

We have not put a timeframe on the meeting.  In the context of the previous item, it was my hope I would be in a position to attend the D&aacute;il Chamber for Leaders' Questions.  Oftentimes there are justice issues when I would like to be near the Taoiseach who in such cases likes to have me near at hand.  I am, however, in the hands of the committee.<\/p> <p>  The justice Vote group is made up of six Votes with in 2018 a combined gross expenditure allocation of &euro;2.58 billion - &euro;2.43 billion in current expenditure and &euro;144 million in capital expenditure.  In addition, there is a further capital provision of &euro;17.9 million in unspent capital from 2017 available for spending in 2018 under the capital carryover provisions.<\/p> <p>  By way of information for committee members, there were eight votes in the justice Vote group in 2017.  However, arising from a decision of the Government, responsibility for the Votes for the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland, all of which were previously part of the Justice and Equality Vote group, was transferred to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2018.  These are constituent bodies which will eventually merge to form T&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann.<\/p> <p>  The gross expenditure Estimate for the Garda Vote - Vote 20 - is &euro;1.650 billion which amounts to 64% of the funding for the entire Vote group.  The Estimate for 2018 is increased further by an additional amount of &euro;8.9 million carried forward from 2017 under the capital carryover provisions.  The high proportion of resources again allocated to the Garda Vote in 2018 underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensure a strong and visible police presence throughout the State, maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance for citizens and deter crime.  <\/p> <p>  In July 2016 the Government agreed an overall vision for the Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  Since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Taking account of retirements, Garda numbers increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017.  This represented a net increase of more than 600 since the end of 2016.  In addition, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during 2018, 200 of whom attested over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day weekend.  This will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.  A further 800 new Garda recruits will also enter the Garda College this year.  I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to increase, with the numbers at the end of 2017 showing more civilians working in the organisation than in each of the previous seven years.  Funding for a further 500 additional civilians is provided in the 2018 Estimate.  In that context, I expect the process of civilianisation to accelerate this year.<\/p> <p>  In addition to staffing resources, significant investment continues to be made in other areas of the Garda Vote.  I am particularly pleased that an additional &euro;157 million in capital investment was secured for the justice sector following the mid-term review of the Government&rsquo;s capital plan for the period 2016 to 2021, a significant proportion of which relates to the Garda Vote.  This level of funding is reflected in the national development plan that was published recently.  The plan provides for significant continuing investment in Garda capital funding in the next ten years, including ICT as a central component of the Garda modernisation and renewal programme; the Garda building and refurbishment programme; development of Garda training facilities; and continuing investment in the Garda fleet.  In 2018 the ICT and telecommunications budget is &euro;40 million.  There is a further &euro;5 million available for expenditure on the transport fleet and almost &euro;25.6 million in the Garda capital building and refurbishment programme.  The total Garda capital expenditure budget in the period 2018 to 2021 is in the region of &euro;400 million.<\/p> <p>  With these unprecedented levels of investment come responsibilities and deliverables and the resources are intrinsically linked with the modernisation and renewal programme which is the vehicle for implementation of the agreed recommendations made in the Garda Inspectorate's report Changing Policing in Ireland and the commitments given in A Programme for a Partnership Government aimed at increasing the visibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Members will be aware that the Policing Authority is overseeing implementation of the recommendations and reports on a quarterly basis.  To date, it has submitted four reports which have been published.  As evidenced in the reports, good progress is being made in a number of areas, with more to be done on a number of the other recommendations made.  A prioritisation exercise under way is an effective strategy.  In that context, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acknowledges that there are key recommendations that, if implemented, will have the capacity to leverage significant change in the organisation.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that positive progress has been made in embedding the code of ethics throughout the force.  Also, the divisional model of policing will shortly be rolled out on a pilot basis in four divisions.  Under this model, responsibilities will be allocated on a functional, rather than a geographical, basis, subject to modifications, to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in large rural divisions.  The Commissioner has selected the four divisions - the Dublin metropolitan region south central, Cork city, Galway and Mayo - for the pilot scheme in order to provide a mix of urban and rural policing environments.  Members will also be aware that the Independent Commission on the Future of Policing commenced work in May 2017.  It is due to report in September.  It is consulting widely in the course of its work, including with the public and civic society and other bodies or individuals it considers appropriate, including all of the major stakeholders.  It also held a meeting with Members of the Houses, with a strong cross-party attendance.  I acknowledge the contribution of members of the committee in that regard.  The commission issued a request for submissions on all aspects of its terms of reference.  It has also held public meetings in a number of venues across the State, including Dublin, Cork, Donegal, Waterford, Athlone and Limerick, among others.  Commission members have visited urban and rural Garda stations in a number of counties and also undertaken study visits in Ireland, Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the United States of America.  I look forward to receiving the output of this extensive body of work later this year.<\/p> <p>  Vote 24 - Justice and Equality - has a gross Estimate provision of just under &euro;444 million and is broken down into five separate programmes comprising almost 60 separate subheads reflecting the Department&rsquo;s strategy.  Programme A is leadership in and oversight of justice and equality policy and delivery.  It includes areas such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, both of which are important bodies in the deliberations of the committee.  An additional &euro;4 million is being provided for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, bringing the total budget to almost &euro;11.7 million in 2018.  The increased budget is reflective of the additional staffing and other resource requirements of the office in view of the fundamental transformation of the data protection environment arising from implementation of the general data protection regulation this year.<\/p><p>The increased funding fully reflects the importance of a stable and effective data protection regulatory environment in terms of the personal data of individuals but also in relation to the broader economy and in particular the continuing expansion and growth of the digital technology sector.  It was also possible to provide an additional &euro;300,000 to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to strengthen staffing resources including a new unit established on protected disclosures.  The resource requirements will continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p> Programme B, a safe and secure Ireland, includes funding for front-line support services and agencies such as Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, the Probation Service, and Services to Victims of Crime, Cosc and State Pathology.  I am pleased that the building of a new forensic science lab on a site at Backweston in County Kildare will proceed this year.  Site enabling and other preparatory works commenced this year.  A total of &euro;9 million is being provided this year, with significant funding capital provided in the capital plan to complete the construction over the next couple of years.  Forensic Science Ireland makes a most significant expert contribution to the criminal justice system.  Funding to continue to develop the new facility is most important.  Not only will this provide a state-of-the-art facility to enable FSI to provide a much improved service in analysing samples submitted from crime scenes, providing expert witness in criminal trials, but also it will facilitate the merger of FSI with the Garda Technical Bureau.<\/p><p> Programme C, access to justice, includes the provision for the Legal Aid Board, the coroner service and the costs associated with commissions and special inquires.<\/p><p> Programme D, an equal and inclusive society, provides for funding for the Office of Migrant Integration as well as provision for Traveller initiatives, gender equality, disability awareness and social inclusion measures across a wide spectrum of areas.  The Estimate for 2018 includes a provision of &euro;3 million for the Decision Support Service under the aegis of the Mental Health Commission.  This funding will facilitate the implementation of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The role of the Decision Support Service is to support decision making by and for adults experiencing capacity difficulties.<\/p><p> Programme E, an efficient responsive and fair immigration, asylum and citizenship system.  This mainly includes funding for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and asylum seekers accommodation.  Additional funding this year of &euro;4 million is provided to establish the new passenger information unit, the primary role of which is to protect the safety and security of individuals through the prevention and detection of terrorist offences and serious crime.  Turning to the prison's Vote, Vote 21, the current estimate in 2018 is for &euro;341 million plus an additional &euro;2.23 million in unspent capital from last year.  The funding this year includes the provision for the financing of a step-down facility for women prisoners in the Dublin area.  It will accommodate women for a period of time following custody or on probation supervision who are assessed as suitable to reside in the community and have accommodation or other needs which require support.  The prison's capital budget over the period 2018 to 2021 will be in the region of &euro;120 million.  It will enable construction of the new wing in Limerick Prison as well as the improvement of facilities in Portlaoise and other prisons including the development of a masterplan for the Mountjoy campus aimed at centralising and enhancing shared services on that site.  A total Estimate in gross terms of &euro;132 million is being provided for the Courts Service, Vote 22, plus an additional &euro;6 million in unspent capital from last year.  The unspent capital from last year mainly relates to payments in respect of the regional public private partnership projects, PPPs, including a VAT payment to the Revenue Commissioners which did not fall due until this year.  The estimate for this year includes &euro;55 million in capital funding, including the carryover amount, mainly relating to the repayments in related to projects delivered under the PPP, mechanism but also including continuing investment in information and communications technology, ICT.  An additional &euro;5 million in ICT investment is being made available over the period 2019 to 2021 for enhanced courtroom technology to assist the efficient running of the courts as well as facilitating increased collaboration within the justice sector in criminal matters and the development in data sharing between agencies across the justice system.  A gross Estimate of &euro;3.34 million has been provided for the Policing Authority, Vote 41, which includes an increase of &euro;600,000 compared with 2017 to provide for additional staffing, accommodation and other costs associated with the important work of the Policing Authority.  The gross expenditure budget for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, Vote 25, is &euro;6.7 million to enable it to continue its important work in promoting and protecting human rights and equality.  In conclusion, a Chathaoirligh, that is a synopsis of the very broad justice sector group which I have given and I would be happy to take questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#C00900","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat a Aire.

I have two questions on this Vote.  I refer to Garda pay and numbers in a general sense.  It has been indicated that the 2021 target is 15,000 sworn members of the Garda.  It is not terribly far off that or it will not be at the end of this year by my understanding.  Having said that, from my conversations with garda&iacute; in Cork and I am sure it is the case elsewhere, what seems to be happening is that with the very welcome establishment of specialist units, an awful lot of experienced garda&iacute; are being drawn away from core units and into specialist units, with the effect that a lot of the core units are still where they were in 2009 or 2010, even at this stage, with the additional recruits.  There are still more or less the same numbers in core units.  I ask the Minister in that context if he believes that the 2021 target for sworn members of the Garda should be revised to try to ensure that the core units that are serving communities, that are visible in communities, are at an adequate level.  An awful lot of the spare capacity is indirectly going into the specialist units.  I do not necessarily have a problem with that.  A lot of those are very valuable, particularly the protective unit, but it does mean that sergeants are struggling, even at this stage, to make sure that the garda&iacute; are visible in their communities.  It is not just rural areas, there are areas of big population where there could be just two cars between two stations and they are stretched between areas of big population.<\/p> <p>  The other question I have is on the administration subhead 5, office equipment and external IT services.  There was a reduction of 3%.  I am not sure if that is the exact subhead that is relevant.  I ask the Minister in a general sense whether it relates to that head or not.  The national development plan makes reference to ICT being a central component of Garda modernisation and renewal.  We have heard for years and years about the inadequacy of PULSE.  It has manifested itself across a wide range of areas in terms of poor data or data being inputted incorrectly and the implications that has.  That was broader than PULSE but PULSE is a factor here and it is vitally important that it is completely overhauled and replaced.  I want to know what commitment has been made to the IT upgrade in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2018, or whether that is reflected in that subhead and if that is a 3% reduction in the relevant subhead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#D00300","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":230,"content":"<p>In respect of Garda numbers, I accept what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said in so far as we are moving rapidly towards the year 2021 and the ambitious targets for Garda recruitment.  I am quite satisfied that these numbers will continue to grow until we have the overall Garda force of 15,000 sworn members by 2021, ably assisted by 4,000 civilians and 2,000 reservists, bringing a total complement of 21,000.

I do not intend to review that figure but I am anxious to ensure I am in a position to pledge resources to allow this state of affairs to continue in a way that was not the case during the years of difficult economic challenge.

Is there any indication that the issue is being addressed properly?  If one looks at the most recent year for which we have figures, namely, 2016, the number of breaches of public procurement guidelines by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone was 94, which amounted to &euro;27.8 million.  Does the Minister expect to see a decrease for the 2017 and 2018 accounts?  The figures suggest that breaches are increasing year on year, rather than decreasing.  In 2015, there were 73 breaches of public procurement rules by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In July 2017, the director of finance for the Garda, Mr. Michael Culhane, told Deputy Connolly that he accepted 73 was a high number but the Garda was addressing actively all of those issues and working with the Office of Government Procurement.  If we fast-forward to the 2016 accounts for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which were released in September 2017, there were 94 contracts which breached public procurement guidelines.  As I said, that amounted to &euro;27.8 million.<\/p> <p>  Is the Minister concerned that no one seems to be responsible for this?  I asked Ms Josephine Feehily, chair of the Policing Authority, about this issue last month.  She said that one thing that frustrated one of her colleagues was that if the Garda wants to hire a clerical officer, it must approval from the Policing Authority whereas if it wants to spend &euro;10 million on ICT, it does not.  She said the authority had a very narrow competence in respect of money and she believes it should be broadened.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on that?  To give him an example from today's figures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's expenditure on external ICT services for 2018 is estimated to be &euro;41 million.  In 2016, it was &euro;50 million.  An audit by the Garda internal audit section found that &euro;26.5 million of that was paid to Accenture, dated from a contract of 2009 and was in breach of public procurement guidelines.

I am aware of an internal audit report last August which raised some concerns and made a number of recommendations regarding the procurement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of certain ICT services.  I understand from Garda authorities that the contract in question commenced in 2009.  It ran for an initial two-year period with a further two-year extension until the end of 2013.  It was extended after this time without recourse to tendering.  I understand that there was a delay in the tendering for the contract due to a combination of factors, including the complex nature of the process but also a lack of resource in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prepare a new tender and run an appropriate procurement competition.  It can be recalled that the Garda ICT area suffered from the general reduction in the ICT cohort throughout the public sector.  However, another factor was that ICT management was awaiting the development of the national procurement framework.  I am concerned by this issue and any breach.  No breach in what is a specifically designed arrangement would in the circumstances be accommodated or accepted.  Steps are now being taken to ensure all the recommendations in the internal audit report are implemented.  Progress in this regard is being monitored internally by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and by my Department.  I understand the position regarding the main contract will be addressed.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, framework has been in place since last August.  It is currently being utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tender for its skills requirements.

It means that we will have extra garda&iacute; coming out every year.  I was delighted when I heard that there would be an extra 4,000 civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by 2021.  I was led to believe that when this happened, between 1,500 and 2,000 trained garda&iacute; would be back on the beat or on motorways.

Are there any plans to invest money in Dromad?  It is so congested it impossible for people to park in the area.  The extra resources in the Garda station have helped combat crime.  It is a Border county.  Could the Minister come to Dundalk over the next few weeks?  Is it the case that in most Garda stations there is only one garda and a queue of people?

I am keen to ensure that the civilianisation programme not only continues but gathers momentum and is accelerated.  There are more than 2,250 full-time civilians in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na doing administrative and technical duties.  It is important that the process continues.  Sanction has been obtained for 281 further posts.  We are considering first addressing some skill gaps and capacity issues, for example, civilians with expertise in the area of finance and information and communications technology, ICT.  The Garda is engaging with the Policing Authority in respect of 116 business cases.  I want to see movement on these over the coming weeks.  The immediate consequence of this will be redeployment.  We have set a target of replacing 1,500 garda&iacute;.  I want to see as many garda&iacute; as possible returning to core full-time duties because that is what they are best placed to do and that is what their core training equips them for.  The principal focus so far has been on filling critical skill gaps.  I would be happy to keep the committee fully informed.  It is a priority to ensure that by 2021 there will be a civilian cohort within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of 4,000.  They will work with, or be an integral part of, a Garda force of 21,000, including 15,000 sworn members, 4,000 civilians and 2,000 reservists.  It is important to put more emphasis on the Garda Reserve.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of this committee in passing the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.  The Commissioner has put in place a victim service office in each of the 28 Garda divisions.  These will be the central point for victims of crime in each division.  They will be staffed by people who have specific training in prioritising the needs of victims and there will be specially trained civilian personnel.

This would free up significant resources.  Perhaps this matter will be considered in future.<\/p> <p>  Members do not support the establishment of a step-down for women.  It is incredibly paternalistic to introduce a structure of this type for female offenders who are moving back into the community, particularly given that women are generally incarcerated for crimes of poverty and other offences with low levels of violence.  We would prefer a much more empowering structure to be established to enable women to move back to their communities and live in proper accommodation rather than in some sort of halfway house.  Most European countries are moving away from the halfway house model.

It is important that there be a level of engagement by way of preparing people for coming out of prison and into the community.  That is the type of facility we are speaking of in terms of what is called a step across into the community.  I recently visited a successful engagement in Waterford which prepares prisoners for work.  The project is an example of collaboration between prisoners and industry and commerce and involves a level of sponsorship.  People coming out of prison are sponsored to engage in work, and many of those who have been through the project have found permanent employment.  It is important we consider this approach.<\/p> <p>  The alternatives to prison in terms of community service are an important part of the criminal justice system, with particular reference to the application of restorative justice and working in the community.

Active engagement is required to ensure former prisoners have a house, receive appropriate treatment, have access to employment etc.  However, given that a step-down facility is not provided for men, it is paternalistic to provide one for women.  The idea of open centres for women located in the community as an alternative to incarceration is a more modern approach and best policy.

Also, as many as 89% of Facebook users are served by Facebook Ireland.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland will be the main regulator of how Facebook uses and shares the data of its users.

An extra &euro;300,000 will not scratch the surface in meeting the challenges that face GSOC.  However, &euro;67 million is a lot of money, yet it is pretty much agreed that the current structure is seriously disappointing and not fit for purpose.

On GSOC, resources and funding are kept under continuing review.  I repeat it is absolutely essential that the ombudsman commission operates effectively and has sufficient resources to allow for that effective operation.  A few weeks ago a business proposal was submitted seeking 37 additional staff at a cost of &euro;1.7 million.  This matter is under active consideration at the moment.  Active consideration is also being given to allowing GSOC to retain an additional &euro;1 million in funding from the now closed fixed charge notices, FCN, investigation.  That would put GSOC in a position to address some of the issues raised.  Consideration will be given to providing GSOC with its own Vote and providing that an officer of GSOC would be the Accounting Officer in the context of proposals to change legislation.  In this regard, as I said earlier, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which will report to me in September, is important.  I believe there is an important role for that body in assessing the current independence or otherwise of GSOC.  I look forward to ongoing engagement with the chairman and members of the commission with a view to ensuring that it fulfils its statutory functions in such a way that those who are in receipt of or seeking its services will have confidence.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of direct provision, it is not my wish that people would spend long periods in accommodation provided by the State.

The numbers in direct provision accommodation for a period of five years or more at the end of December last year are significantly lower than those in a similar position at the end of December 2016.  The numbers are down from just under 600 to 430.<\/p><p>However, it is important that we ensure the applications are dealt with.  There are considerable changes under the 2015 Act that will lead towards that.  Within our democracy it is open to any applicant, who may not have succeeded in their initial application, to appeal.  That is their entitlement under our law and one that I very much respect.  However, having regard to the various stages of an appeal, it gives rise to people being in the system for what might be regarded as a very considerable period.  It is partly due to initiatives and appeals that are going through our legal process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018041800002#P00500","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524043200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I have a final question on this.

I am awaiting the Minister's arrival.  He is outside and will be with us shortly.  As members are all aware, transport, tourism and sport face challenging times with numerous issues arising from Brexit and capital and current infrastructure projects in all three sectors, as well as many other issues that we have discussed in our joint committee.  The financing and resourcing for the year ahead of the responses to those challenges will be very important.  Our committee will get to explore this today with some emphasis on several key issues.  The proposed format of today's meeting is that we will deal with Vote 31 on a programme-by-programme basis.  At the outset, the Minister will make an opening statement.  There are five programmes and we will then consider each of the programmes separately, with questions from members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  Before proceeding to the business of the meeting, I remind members that their mobile telephones should be turned off completely for the duration of the meeting, as they cause interference with the recording equipment in committee rooms even in silent mode.

The 2018 provision for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport comprises an overall gross allocation of &euro;2.03 billion.  This is to be used to provide investment in critical infrastructure and to ensure that vital services are available to the public during 2018.  The &euro;2.03 billion represents an increase of more than 11% on gross expenditure levels from 2017.  This is an increase of 3.4%, or &euro;23 million, in current or day-to-day expenditure, while capital or investment expenditure will increase by over &euro;197 million, or 17%.  This additional funding across all sectors will help us to invest and expand services this year beyond what was conceivable only a few years ago.  In following years, there will be a significant intensification in activity.<\/p> <p>  I wish to say a few words about Project Ireland 2040 which, as members are aware, includes the national planning framework and the ten-year national development plan, NDP.  The programme of investment set out in the NDP will result in a comprehensive road, bus and rail network.  This will provide a high level of service to all regions and will link the regions to one another, as well as to Dublin.  It will be delivered progressively to match transport demand and deliver benefits steadily over the next decade.  This investment in transport will improve accessibility to every part of the country.  In the context of Brexit, this is crucial for the transport and tourism sectors.  This is supported by the non-Exchequer investments set out in the tier 1 area of the NDP, namely, ports and their access routes.  Similarly the improved access to airports will facilitate access to tourism and export markets. <\/p> <p>  I will now briefly address the five programmes of investment in my Department and the funding levels and plans we have for 2018.<\/p> <p>  The civil aviation programme has an allocation of &euro;28 million this year.  The largest element of the programme is the regional airports programme at &euro;13.6 million.  Funding is also earmarked to cover costs associated with our membership of Eurocontrol, other subscriptions to international organisations and costs incurred by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, for exempt services.  The State reimburses the IAA for communication and air navigation services in respect of exempted classes of users, that is, military and state aircraft.  The key priority for investment in the aviation programme over the short to medium term is to facilitate continued safe and viable operations at the regional airports and to maintain air access to relatively remote regions, specifically counties Donegal and Kerry.<\/p> <p>  The land transport programme, which is the largest programme by far in my Department&rsquo;s Vote and represents 81% of my overall budget, will increase this year by &euro;203 million or 14% to &euro;1.66 billion.  A large portion of this is capital investment.  The main components of the programme are roads improvement and maintenance funding with an overall budget of &euro;883 million, the public transport investment programme at &euro;401 million and public service provision payments at &euro;300 million.  The programme also includes provision of &euro;5.5 million towards the carbon reduction programme and operating costs of the national vehicle driver licensing system at &euro;19 million.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of public transport, I secured increased multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period.  This includes providing an enhanced capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion for a multi-modal public transport investment programme between 2018 and 2021.  The four-year envelope will allocate investment to protect the quality and value of our existing public transport networks.  Programmes to be funded include BusConnects, MetroLink, DART expansion, ongoing retrofitting of older existing public transport facilities to improve their accessibility features, as well as cycling and walking and traffic management measures, both in our capital and nationwide.  These programmes will be implemented by Irish Rail and the National Transport Authority, NTA, which has statutory responsibility for development of public transport in the greater Dublin area. <\/p> <p>  This year, I secured an 8% increase in the overall Exchequer funding for public service obligation, PSO, services across the bus and rail networks.  These services have grown in recent years, and the increase in funding in 2018 brings the cumulative increase over the three years from 2016 to 2018 to &euro;75 million, or 36%.  That means that a total of more than &euro;285 million will be allocated in 2018 to support the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services.  It is of course also an area which requires ongoing scrutiny to ensure the taxpayer receives value for money in respect of the services delivered, given the considerable expenditure incurred.  As is normal, the precise allocations to the companies, including Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, will be decided by the NTA in accordance with the various contract arrangements that it has in place with PSO service providers.  Additionally, rural transport services that respond to local needs have also increased and we will continue to support these through enhanced funding.<\/p> <p>  In respect of roads, my main priority remains the maintenance and safety of the network.  The 2018 allocation will allow approximately 2,300 km of the regional and local road network to be maintained and approximately 2,100 km to be strengthened.  Major capital roads projects to be progressed include the Naas bypass widening, Sallins bypass and Osberstown interchange project, the upgrading of the Nangor and Adamstown roads near Grange Castle Business Park; and two public private partnership, PPP, projects which are under construction, namely, the New Ross bypass and the Gorey to Enniscorthy project, the Gort to Tuam PPP having been completed and the route opened.  Planning, design, land acquisition and advance works will continue on other major capital plan schemes including the Dunkettle scheme, the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme, the N4 from Collooney to Castlebaldwin scheme and the N5 from Westport to Turlough scheme.<\/p> <p>  I will now comment on road safety.  The operations of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety are within the remit of my Department.  While the funding for these two bodies is small, at just over &euro;5 million, the work achieved by both is huge and vitally important.  I note the RSA has significant revenue-raising powers.  Last year, 2017, was the safest year on Ireland&rsquo;s roads since road deaths were first recorded in 1959, with 159 deaths.  While even one death is too many, I hope this trend in decreased road deaths continues.  We will continue to support those bodies in achieving their goals.<\/p><p>The key funding priorities for the maritime transport and safety programme in 2018 are the maintenance of the Irish Coast Guard's search and rescue helicopter service, the continuation of the Coast Guard building programme for volunteers and an annual contribution of more than &euro;7 million towards the costs of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  Of the &euro;96 million provided for the maritime, transport and safety programme,<b><\/b>&euro;66 million is provided for the Irish Coast Guard's helicopter search and rescue contract.  Current expenditure of &euro;3.5 million is provided for to meet the operational costs and training of volunteer Irish Coast Guard units.  The capital allocation of &euro;5 million will be used to meet the building and renovation costs of Irish Coast Guard stations, replace and upgrade search and rescue-related equipment, develop new IT systems and procure other equipment relating to the Irish Coast Guard's remit.  My Department continues to support the excellent work carried out by the Irish Coast Guard and its volunteer cadre.  Its work was seen during the recent Storm Emma weather alert, where it supported local communities, principal response agencies and the emergency services.<br\/><br\/>The sports programme shows an increase from 2017 of more than &euro;3 million to &euro;111 million.  The sports capital programme is the primary means of providing Government funding to sport and community organisations at local, regional and national level.  In November and December 2017, the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, and I announced &euro;60 million in allocations under the 2017 round of the sports capital programme to more than 1,800 different sporting projects.  The investment envelope covers these awards and commitments made under earlier rounds of the programme.  The capital envelope for sport also provides &euro;4 million to meet all existing commitments under the local authority swimming pool programme.  Further funding of &euro;5 million was made available for sports measures through dormant accounts funding, mainly towards supporting the implementation of the national physical activity plan in disadvantaged communities.<br\/><br\/>As for future investment, the recently published national development plan contains a commitment to establish a new large scale sport infrastructure fund for which at least &euro;100 million will be available during the roll-out of the NDP.  My officials will draft the terms and conditions of this new fund over the coming months.  This fund will be for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution would exceed the amount currently available for projects under the sports capital programme.  The allocation for Sport Ireland will allow it to continue to address its key priorities of increasing participation in sport and developing and supporting high performance sport in Ireland.  Work commenced in July 2017 on the development of phase 2 of the national indoor arena<b>, <\/b>which is due for completion in mid-2019.  This phase will see the construction of full-sized and half-sized covered synthetic pitches, capable of accommodating all field sports, together with changing facilities, offices, meeting rooms etc.<br\/><br\/>I turn to the tourism services programme.  The overall envelope for tourism this year will be &euro;134 million, which represents an increase of &euro;12 million on 2017.  This includes an allocation of &euro;3.6 million for greenways.  Greenways have been a stand-out success story and a new development strategy is being worked on at present.  The draft strategy should be published and available within the next few weeks.  The &euro;134 million allocation for the tourism programme will allow F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to continue to develop Ireland's tourism industry, driven by the further development and promotion of the signature experience brands Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland's Ancient East.  Last Thursday, I launched Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, a new tourism brand that will significantly enhance the midlands and bring jobs and economic growth to the whole region.<br\/><br\/>As we are all aware, Brexit is a significant challenge and Tourism Ireland has a programme of marketing activity in place for 2018.  This programme will ensure Ireland is marketed appropriately in Great Britain while seeking to build on the successful strategy of market diversification implemented since 2014.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also launched a &quot;Get Brexit ready&quot; programme of business supports to provide all the relevant information and insights businesses will need.  Last year, I said that 2016 had been an exceptional year for overseas visitors.  Today, I am happy to be able to say that 2017 was a record-breaking year.  The pattern is continuing in the early months of 2018.  The CSO recently confirmed that, in the two months to the end of February 2018, the total number of trips to Ireland increased by 7.9% when compared with the same period in 2017.<br\/><br\/>To conclude, in 2017 we made good progress across all the programmes under my Department's remit.  I have secured in budget 2018 increased multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period and look forward to progressing the major infrastructural projects included in the NDP.  I expect to see continued momentum across all sectors.  I am happy to answer any questions in respect of the 2018 Estimate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#B00700","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":424,"content":"<p>The meeting is now open to the floor.

The introduction of the third Luas line has exposed a capacity constraint in the city centre in terms of the amount of surface space to be shared.  A project that is not included in the national development plan is the DART underground.  The Minister referred to how every part of the country was accessible, but the place that is probably the least accessible is the one where there is the greatest amount of public transport.  As part of this meeting, we will be considering matters such as moving people into more sustainable types of public transport owing to potential fines, since transport is one of the main areas in respect of which those fines will be incurred.  Is the Minister involved in any discussion on revising the plan or is there any scope for such a reconsideration in this year's budget?<\/p> <p>  I asked questions about the rolling stock.  The point of order to the point of delivery takes five years and I understand that there is nothing on order at the moment, although some rolling stock is being refurbished.  To use the Maynooth line as an example, services that originate in Maynooth are standing room only even from the first train at 6.40 a.m. until it reaches Leixlip, which is the next stop.  We can only move people onto sustainable forms of public transport if that transport is available.  They would undoubtedly use it.<\/p><p>Is there any scope with regard to orders regarding new rolling stock in the budget at which we are looking or will any be initiated?  <\/p><p> In respect of the roads programme, I know some of the money goes to Transport Infrastructure Ireland and that is for national roads.  Other funding comes from the local property tax.  About ten local authorities are required to self fund from the local property tax.  For example, Dublin funds entirely through the local property tax.  It does not get a transfer from Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  What account, if any, is taken in this budget of the local property tax in the figures that have been presented?  Is that an additional amount?  Given that this is being revisited, is the Minister accounting for the changes that might happen as a consequence of those changes and that might reduce the amount that is required to be self funded by some of the local authorities?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#D04800","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":482,"content":"<p>In respect of the roads budget, and I acknowledge there is an increase, does the Department factor in the exceptional weather such as that we experienced in the past number of months?

However, I have a number of concerns.  Deputy O'Keeffe has already highlighted one that concerns the condition of our regional and county roads.  We brought forward a Private Members' motion in January 2018 to which the Minister undertook to reply and outline clearly how he and the Department intend to address the deficiencies highlighted in the review of our county and regional roads.  The roads have got progressively worse with the bad weather over the past number of months.  I acknowledge that the Minister cannot be blamed for the bad weather.  I would not try to land blame on him where it is not merited but he is in a position to ensure that each local authority is adequately resourced to respond to that bad weather.  Could he indicate when he will fulfill his commitment under the Private Members' motion and publish his reply and timeframe for the works to be completed?<\/p> <p>  Under documents to be published, I understand the Department is reviewing optimal land use in terms of settlement strategy.  At what stage is that optimal land use review?  The Minister identified a number of bottlenecks that would help address and give priority to buses and public transport.  Have the various transport companies - Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail from a signalling point of view - identified a list of works that could be completed that would alleviate bottlenecks, reduce journey time and increase the efficiency of the service?  If so, where are those lists, who is adjudicating them, who is costing them and is there a timeframe for when work might commence?  <\/p> <p>  In his contribution, the Minister mentioned cycling infrastructure.  Unfortunately, during his term, the cycling infrastructure budget has almost halved.  Perhaps I am missing it in the documents here.  Is it the Minister's intention to reverse previous years' reductions in the cycling infrastructure budget?  If so, how much does he intend to reverse it by?  What is the 2018 figure?  <\/p> <p>  Anyone looking in here today will acknowledge that there are plans for Metro North, BusConnects and new road investments but the simple fact is that I got a phone call yesterday morning from a friend of mine who lives in Dublin 8 who told me that at 8.30 a.m. two trams and three buses passed him by because they were chock-a-block.  There is no capacity in our public transport services.  With the best will in the world, as Deputy Catherine Murphy already alluded to, there is a five-year lead-in time for any new train to be ordered.  The Minister has yet to say what he can do now to address overcrowding.  Is there any commitment on his part to increase the number of buses?  He constantly says that the number of new buses ordered by Dublin Bus is in the region of 100 or 112 - correct me if I am wrong - but in fact, he never allows for or acknowledges the fact that every year under the 12-year rule, a number of buses go out of service so the net increase in terms of the number of buses for Dublin Bus is in the low teens per annum at a time when the number of people using public transport is increasing steadily, which is to be welcomed.  However, people will not continue to use it if it is not reliable and is overcrowded.  Unfortunately, this is what is happening now.  The longer trams have been delayed.  Freedom of information requests I have submitted to the Department indicate that it was aware that there were potential technical difficulties with the longer trams but the Minister proceeded to roll them out.  Now we have a situation where they have gone back to the manufacturers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#E02900","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1524040800,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Has the Minister a timeframe as to when we can expect those longer trams to be back in operation?<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>Deputy Troy has alluded to the question of increasing congestion and I accept what he said about trams, trains and buses.  The Department needs a strategic plan for dealing with congestion to ensure work days do not get any longer than they have become.  Delays for people commuting by car in Drogheda and east Meath, where I live, are increasing all the time and traffic speeds are being reduced.  If one has to use the car, one has no alternative but to sit in longer queues.  I know the metro has good proposals for strategic park-and-ride facilities around the Malahide estuary which would be hugely welcomed when they are in place.  Is there any way we could fast-track some of those proposals?<\/p> <p>  What plans has the Minister for dealing with congestion, longer commute days and people getting home late at night?  When I use the M1 motorway, the average speed, even at 10 o'clock at night, is 100 km\/h.  People are in long traffic queues.  I fear for the issue now unless we deal with it strategically.

With speeds and so forth, it does not equate with a DART underground.  We already have a problem with capacity on surface rail.  Without using below-ground capacity, there will always be that constraint.<\/p> <p>  I was a member of the Dublin transportation initiative in the early 1990s when a suite of measures was deemed necessary to make the city capable of functioning.  The reason European funding was provided at the time under a particular programme was because Dublin was underperforming due to congestion.  For example, Luas, metro and the DART underground proposals were all critical components in making the city function.  The investment in the railways was from the 19th century where they are all disconnected from each other.  The 20th century required pulling them together.  We failed to do that in the 20th century and we are now going to fail to do it in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>  I was in Berlin recently, a city with a population of 4.5 million, a much larger population than Dublin, and did not see one traffic jam.  It is because it has a network and not bits and pieces of a network.  The DART underground is that critical missing piece for Dublin.  I have to take issue with the Phoenix Park tunnel being equated with a substitute for DART underground.  It simply is not.  There is no understanding of the requirement of making this capital city work.  The city and the region cannot work without that piece of the network.  The ever longer traffic jams on the M1, the M4 and the M7, as pointed out by the Chairman, are a consequence of not having a proper public transport system in Dublin city.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has made a political decision on it and it is not part of the ten-year strategy.

For the most part they are reliant on cars and motor vehicles to take them around the county and to bring them in and out of it.  In the last number of months, the ponding of water has become a serious problem on county, regional and national secondary roads and even on the national primary road at Glenflesk.  Does the Minister have contingency or emergency plans to deal with the ponding of water?  It is a serious issue affecting the health and safety of people who travel on our roads.  It is a severe risk.  Many of the inlets where the water should be going are closed up.  I ask the Minister to liaise with the local authorities - we have been asking them and it appears they do not have the funding - with a view to giving them more funding to specifically deal with the problem of the ponding of water on the sides of our roads.  Cars have to swerve out but if there is a car coming against them they cannot do that.  It means they drive into a pool of water, it goes over the roof of the car and they cannot see where they are.  They are hitting ditches and it is a problem at present.  It is a fine day in Dublin today and it was a fine day here yesterday but it poured out of the heavens in Kerry yesterday and it is pouring out of the heavens in Kerry again today.  It is like we are in two different worlds.  There is a serious problem down there.<\/p> <p>  I apologise to Deputies Troy and O'Keeffe.

That allocation was a largely increased allocation.  It was a substantially increased allocation for local roads.  It was accompanied by a clear message to local authorities that they should provide their own contingency fund in the event of exceptional damage of this sort.  That was made absolutely clear to them at the time and that remains the situation.  There obviously will be forms to fill in.  They can apply clean-up charges, which I gather they are doing at the moment, and they are receiving them.  There are no plans for any extra funds to be provided as a result of the storm damage in Storm Emma because of the stipulation that was made at the time that they should make their own contingencies and because there were large increases.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy asked about the clean-up costs.  Local authorities could certainly apply for clean-up costs and I gather a large number of them have done so.  They will get a response from my Department in due course.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Troy also asked about cycling infrastructure and said the budget has been halved.  The intention is to increase the budget on cycling infrastructure over four years and to treble it.  That was made absolutely clear.  More than &euro;100 million - I think it was &euro;110 million - was provided for new urban cycling and walking routes in the greater Dublin area and in the Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford city areas, which will provide additional and sustainable travel options to complement increased capacity and faster, higher quality public transport in our main cities.  In previous years, the greenways provided the bulk of the cycling infrastructure.  We separated greenways and increased their funding in the current budget and in the years ahead.<\/p><p>We have provided a large amount of money - I think it is &euro;56 million - for greenways in the coming three years.  That is a commitment which is part of the cycling infrastructure and one which I think the Deputy will welcome.  I think the Deputy is wrong on that issue.  There is a massive commitment to cycling infrastructure which will continue.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#H04800","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt but a lot of the Minister's answers this morning are like a copy and paste from the Ireland 2040 document.

It is taking a huge step forward, not just in this but in greenways and in other areas as well.  The Deputy has seen the Stayin' Alive at 1.5 campaign and has been a great supporter of it.  It is important that it is recognised that the Government is behind cycling infrastructure, safety for cyclists and other cycling measures which we are taking and are going to pursue.  The greenways will not only attract tourists, they will also be useful in terms of reducing pollution and traffic congestion in towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has asked what we are doing now.  The thrust of Government policy on congestion is long term; it has to be long term.  The long-term aim is to get people out of their cars but we are not going to get people out of their cars overnight, just like that.  We will do it using a multifaceted approach which includes increased investment in public transport, cycling and walking and in other areas.  We need to do this, not just because of congestion but for many reasons, including health.  Some of these projects are moving faster than others, of course.  The Luas cross-city and green line extension means that the Luas will accommodate an extra 10 million journeys per annum.  That is immediate and is happening now.  It has been a massive success to such an extent that there has been overcrowding on the trams.  That is something that should be acknowledged.  Passenger numbers on the green line have increased by 28% and that is obviously taking a lot of people off the roads.  The numbers are much larger than expected and we welcome that.  The teething problems to which one of the speakers alluded are being resolved and the Luas will continue to keep those people off the roads.  The BusConnects programme will be starting next year, which is a very exciting and modern form of public transport.  It will be comfortable, efficient and fast and will be effective in taking people off the roads, as will the DART expansion and MetroLink.  I am not going to be able to get people off the roads in the morning and I have never said that.  However, we are attacking this problem in both the short and long term in a way which will resolve it over the medium term.  That is the way it is going to be done but Deputies cannot ask me to say \"tomorrow, this will happen\".  It will not happen.  There are increasing numbers but it is going to happen in the long term.  The plans are laid out very clearly as to how that is going to be done.  It is going to be very effective and that is what the national development plan is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#J00500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>With all due respect, I have read the plan for 2040.

Is the Minister aware of them, have they been costed and when can they be implemented?  That would help with congestion here and now.  I also asked a question about the longer trams.  The reply to the freedom of information request that I submitted indicated that the Department was aware of the technical issues but proceeded to roll them out anyway.  The longer trams are now off the tracks.  When will they be back in use?<\/p> <p>  When will the Department's policy paper on optimal land be published?  Finally, in February a private members' motion was unanimously supported in the D&aacute;il and at that stage the Minister said that he would come back to the House with a clear timeframe for addressing the inadequacies in our regional and county roads.

The rail line to the port generates in the region of &euro;2 million per annum, which is absorbed by CI&Eacute; into its central funding.  I submitted a parliamentary question on this matter.  A motion was passed unanimously by Wexford County Council calling for the structure to be examined with a view to Rosslare Europort retaining that funding and using it to extract even greater funding.

When I was in Rosslare, I was struck by how we had a port that could take more advantage of events like Brexit.  It was my first visit to the port.  I received some particularly enterprising suggestions, which should be examined in a more forensic way than I could do in half an hour at a meeting.  There are possibilities that might not have been examined.  Perhaps some of the structure, template and model could be altered and improved.  I do not want to say much more than that, but the Deputy understands what I mean.  I am not in any way suggesting that the port should be reduced in size.  Rather, if there are opportunities, it might be good for the region and the people who live in the locality.  What the Deputy has said is constructive.  He is kicking an open door as far as I am concerned, but my knowledge of the matter is only a week old.  This prospect should be considered seriously.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Coast Guard equipment, I want to be careful in what I say.  As the Deputy probably knows, the Department has been asked in the interim report to carry out a full review of search and rescue, SAR, operations.  We have already set the terms of reference for that and we are going full speed ahead.

I use every opportunity to raise the matter.  The Minister said in his statement, \"The capital envelope for sport also provides &euro;4 million to meet all existing commitments under the local authority swimming pool programme.\"  The original local authority swimming pool programme opened in about the year 2000.  I know in many cases swimming pools have been completed, but many others were on the list but did not commence or the work on them was not completed.  The programme opened again in a very limited way and there were applications from three areas that fell within the criteria, and two of the applications were included.  The one that did not meet the criteria, unfortunately, was the one in north Kildare, and that was because of a fault on the Kildare side.  The object is to get one swimming pool per every 50,000 people.  My understanding is that that is roughly the standard.  In Kildare there is one swimming pool for 110,000 people and there is no public swimming pool north of Naas.  The population of, say, Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock would be well in excess of that of Waterford city and would approach that of Limerick city, so it is a big gap.  Regarding the sum of &euro;4 million, for a reasonably modest and good-quality, but not gold-plated, swimming pool, it costs somewhere in the region of &euro;8 million.  There is &euro;4 million in the budget, there are the two applications that came through on the most recent programme and there is the residual from the 2000 programme.  What does the &euro;4 million fund?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#N01000","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I have a question.  It is a general question but is based on the issues Deputy Murphy raises.  Regarding the 2040 plan and population growth, taking places such as Drogheda, which has been designated a national growth centre, there will be significant population changes.  The population of Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington in east Meath, for example, has grown from 5,000 to more than 10,000 in an eight-year period.  Is there a case for planning sports infrastructure based on population needs?  Our populations are expanding.  Deputy Murphy rightly picked a conurbation that is bigger than the city of Waterford, and the population of my area is basically the same as that.  There is a deficit, and the problem I see that is really serious is that the planning pressure comes from developers either to purchase existing sports facility grounds and therefore move them away from where the population is or, alternatively, to put pressure on planning authorities for developments without adequate and proper sports facilities.  In other words, should there be, nationally and locally, a sports plan for the expected growth of each growth area in that an area may need X number of playing pitches, Y amount of green space and Z amount of whatever else?  Planners and developers put fierce pressure on local authorities, and we need proper planning and development, we need proper green recreational space and we need proper swimming pools and other facilities.  I do not expect the Minister to answer my question today but I hope this committee might, with the support and agreement of his Department, look at this issue in a national way in order that there are proper recreational facilities and amenities that are contiguous with the expected growth as we decide as a nation to increase the populations in these areas.  One cannot have huge areas with no facilities, with developers running riot and the people left with no infrastructure, with nothing.  I am not just talking about sports infrastructure, there are shopping and other facilities.  However, does the Minister and his Department consider we should meet about just the sports section as a committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2018041800002#N01100","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1524040800,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I will start with Deputy Troy.

It is a very comprehensive document.  There was a public consultation, as the Deputy knows, to which many bodies made representations.  I think there were more than 50 submissions.  It will be a very ambitious programme that will seek a more prominent position for sport in the life of this country than it has at present.

Two of the applications for new pools were valid and they were both in Dublin.  Of the two in Dublin, Lucan was chosen for inclusion in the programme.  That means the projects that remain in the current programme are Castlebar, Buncrana, Edenderry and Lucan, each of which is at various stages of the programme.

It is a new draft.  Regarding Brexit, these tourist figures are a very curious thing.  In a sense they are defying gravity at the moment.  They are fantastic.  The figures for the first two months of this year were up 7.9% on last year, despite what is happening as a result of Brexit, and despite the fact that numbers from the UK are falling.  That might surprise people.  They were up last year, by a smaller amount.  I think it was 3.5%.  They have increased by 7.9% this year, which indicates that we have momentum, despite the fact that there is a fall in British visitors.<\/p> <p>  I do not think that will continue.  I do not know.  However, what the tourism agencies are doing, and very successfully, is finding new markets.  They are also spending money on the UK, so the numbers are not coming down as far as one might expect if viewed alongside the currency, which has fallen 12%.  The number of visitors from the UK has fallen by a very small percentage compared with that, decreasing by 3% or 4%.  We are doing very well despite the fall in the value of sterling.  That does not mean there is any room for complacency.  We did give them extra money last year for digital marketing and research, and they have used that very well.  At the moment we are constantly looking at the possibility of giving more money to our agencies, but we should bear in mind that they are massively successful in what they are doing.  We have been surprised by the success shown in the figures and that they have not fallen further.
