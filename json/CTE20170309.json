He is accompanied by Ms Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Marc MacSharry.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 2 March 2017.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  There are no special items that we will not deal with during the course of dealing with the agenda.<\/p> <p>  No. 3 is correspondence received since the last meeting.  We will put it on the screen.  In category A No. 328A is a briefing document from the HSE for today's meeting.  We shall note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 329A is the opening statement from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.  We shall note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers or Ministers, or both, as follow-ups on previous meetings.  Nos. 300B (i-iii) and 331B are correspondence, dated 17 February 2017 and 8 March 2017, from Mr. Maurice Quinn, Secretary General, Department of Defence.  The correspondence comprises a follow-up to his appearance before the committee on 26 January and a subsequent information request.  It was held over from last week.  Does any member wish to comment?  The second letter came last night.  It deals specifically with the maintenance cost of the Gulfstream IV aircraft.  I suggest we hold it over because we have not had time to consider it.  There is some conflicting information in the public arena on the issue.  We will come back to these two items of correspondence.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 313B and 330B are correspondence, dated 22 February 2017 and 7 March 2017, from Mr. Noel Waters, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, following up on his appearance before the committee on 2 February.  This correspondence was also held over from the last meeting.  It deals with various aspects of the restorative justice schemes.  There is a note on how many staff have been saved by the new building development programme which I think comes under the prison programme.  There is a note on PACE, as it is called.  Can we note it?  There is also information on the number of assaults on prison officers in 2016.  We asked for that information and it has come in separately.  It is the most recent letter to which I referred.  Can we note these items of correspondence and move on?  If members wish to read and use them according to their own perspectives, they may do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I asked a particular question about restorative justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#B00300","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Deputy has received her reply and is free to take and work with it once we have it published.<\/p> <p>  Category C is correspondence from private individuals or other correspondence.  No. 320C is correspondence, dated 15 February 2017, received from an individual regarding fraud allegations made by Teagasc officials.  The last committee received correspondence from this individual and subsequent replies from Teagasc.  The secretariat is working on putting the information together and will circulate it among committee members for the next meeting.  Can we agree to return to this topic at the next meeting?  It was dealt with previously.  We need to get the information given to the last Committee of Public Accounts.  I received a registered letter from the individual concerned which I passed on to the secretariat this morning.  We will come back to the general topic at next week's meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 321C is correspondence, dated 25 February 2017, from Connolly for Kids Hospital on the building of the national children's hospital.  As no date has yet been set for that meeting, we can ask the spokesperson to send a written submission, as indicated in the correspondence.  We have written to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the Department of Health about the estimates for the project and costs incurred to date, asking in addition how it arrived at the original estimates.  Obviously, the Connolly for Kids Hospital group has contacted us.  The first thing we will do is take a written submission.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will be coming back to the issue directly.

The figures in the public domain indicate that it will be the most expensive children's hospital ever anywhere on the globe, which is absolutely shocking.  In terms of our role, we know that there is that information or speculation; therefore, we have an obligation to investigate it and make sure we get some answers.

From the health committee's perspective, it is a question of decision-making and the timelines involved.  We ought to be careful to ensure both committees will not do more or less the same thing.

The first is that the figures that have been quoted publicly in HSE forums versus the figures that are quoted here.  This is the first time these figures have ever been quoted - I have never come across them.  They do not correlate with what has been told to HSE forums, figures which have been publicly spoken about and received in the media.  I will ask questions on that.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is more interesting.  When the HSE in this response outlines the type of services that were being made available as a result of the capital expenditure, by and large, they do not exist.  If the volume of capital spending is accurate - I cannot doubt the bona fides of what has been written here - why are the services, as a result of both capital expenditures of significant money, not in place?  I visited this hospital with the current Minister and there was not a single patient there.

I will ask the secretariat to formally arrange that briefing with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser and to come back to us with a suitable time.<\/p> <p>  No. 332C, dated 8 March 2017, is from the HSE, regarding correspondence we received last week about staff of the former charity Console.  This was received late yesterday evening.  The issue here is, essentially, that there were persons working for Console who have not been paid their wages - I have not read the full details of the letter; Console has gone into liquidation, none of its debts and liabilities have been paid; and the HSE is saying that it is a section 39 agency agreement and the HSE is not legally liable for any liabilities of such organisations.  That is technically legally correct.  However, that is not good enough.  I suggest we take this matter up directly with the Minister for Health.  We cannot preside over a situation where the staff members who were working for Console do not get paid.  It may not be the HSE's legal responsibility but somebody has to pay them.

As indicated in the graph shown on the screen, the expenditure, which has remained relatively stable, involves payments to private nursing homes of approximately &euro;600 million, accounting for just under two thirds of the total, and expenditure on public nursing home costs accounting for around one third.<\/p> <p>  The nursing homes support scheme, also referred to as the fair deal scheme, was introduced in 2009.  It provides financial support to individuals deemed to be in need of nursing home care.  The scheme is cash-limited, rather than demand-led.  That means the HSE can only approve support for new applicants to the extent that its budget allocation allows.  As a result, waiting times for admission to the scheme vary over time.<\/p> <p>  Operationally, the HSE carries out a financial assessment to establish how much an individual deemed to be in need of nursing home care can contribute to the cost of his or her care.  The assessment takes into consideration both the applicant's income and assets.  An individual's contribution, which cannot exceed his or her cost of care, comprises inpatient charges up to a maximum of 80% of his or her income and up to 7.5% of the value of property assets over three years.  The HSE's inpatient charges income has remained stable at around &euro;80 million a year, and is included in the HSE's income as reflected in the annual financial statements.<\/p> <p>  Individuals who own land or residential property, including a family home, have the option to defer the associated assessed care contribution to a future date.  This option is referred to as ancillary State support or the nursing home loan.  Such loans fall due for repayment usually on the death of the individual, or the prior sale of the asset.  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for collection of the repayments, the amount of which is notified to them by the HSE.  The receipts collected are paid directly to the Exchequer.  The cumulative position in regard to nursing home loans over the period 2012 to 2015 is indicated in the following graph which is now onscreen.  The committee may wish to note that the cumulative amount the HSE notified the Revenue to recoup up to the end of 2015 was &euro;50 million.  At 31 December 2015, Revenue had collected 64% of the total amount advised to it for collection, leaving a balance outstanding at that date of &euro;17.8 million.<\/p> <p>  The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provided a legal framework for the repayment of charges that were incorrectly imposed by the former health boards on persons in long-stay care who, since 1976, had a medical card, or who were entitled to a medical card.  That included the establishment of a special fund account, separate from the HSE's financial statements, to manage the payments.  Since the establishment of the scheme, around &euro;453 million has been repaid through the account, to just over 20,000 claimants.  As the graph which is now onscreen indicates, the bulk of that was paid between 2007 and 2009.  Payments amounting to &euro;1.7 million were made in 2015.<\/p> <p>  The 2006 Act also provided for the establishment of a parallel fund account into which claimants could make a voluntary donation towards once-off improvements in public health services for dependent older persons and persons with disabilities.  Since 2007, around &euro;356,000 has been donated to the fund.  Those donations, along with any interest earned, have been paid over to long-stay units.  There was no activity on the donation fund account in 2015.<\/p> <p>  The 2006 Act also provided a framework assigning the HSE statutory responsibility for the operation of patients' private property accounts.  The funds in the accounts are held by the HSE, in trust, on behalf of individuals living in long-stay care institutions run by the HSE.  At 31 December 2015, the total value of funds held was around &euro;129 million in over 9,600 patients' private property accounts in operation in 156 care centres throughout the country.  The sum of &euro;119 million, or 92%, was being held and managed centrally by the HSE.  The remaining 8% or &euro;10 million was held and managed by local care centres, in commercial bank accounts.  Accounting records held locally record each individual patient's current balance and transactions.<\/p> <p>  The statement on internal financial control associated with the patients' private property accounts draws attention to a number of important controls in the management and operation of accounts of this nature.  The statement also sets out the actions being taken by the HSE to address control weaknesses noted by our audits, for example, the absence of required routine reconciliations, insufficient segregation of duties in some care centres due to low staff levels, and inadequate documentation by some care centres over withdrawals from patient accounts.<\/p> <p>  Note 9 of the accounts discloses that at 31 December 2015, the HSE was holding interest earned totalling around &euro;14 million which had yet to be allocated to patients.  Although a central unit was established in 2006, care centres continued to hold significant funds in local bank accounts for some time thereafter.  Interest earned during that time was not credited to individual patient accounts.  The HSE is currently in the process of examining how those funds should be allocated.<\/p> <p>  Note 8 of the accounts also discloses that prior to the establishment of the HSE, the health boards had, based on legal advice then available to them, retained interest earned on patient account balances as a contribution towards their costs incurred in managing the accounts.  Subsequent legal advice noted that they did not have the legal authority to use the funds in that way.<\/p><p>Additional funding will be required to repay these amounts, which relate to periods prior to 2005.  The total amount involved in this regard is estimated at approximately &euro;30 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>We have three specific items on the agenda today.  They are the only items to be discussed.  There are myriad other HSE items which we will deal with another day.  However, before Mr. O'Brien makes his opening statement, I wish to make one comment to him regarding one of his previous appearances at the Committee of Public Accounts in February 2016, when we were discussing the Grace case.  On that day, I understand, he told the committee that the people who in 1996 overturned the decision to remove Grace were no longer State employees.  He went on to say, in respect of the Conal Devine report:<\/p><blockquote>From the outset of its commencement, there was close liaison with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it was always understood and intended that the report would be published and available, whatever action may be necessary.  However, since its conclusion in 2012 [that is, the report], it has not been possible to use it for that purpose, and that is why no disciplinary action has been proceeded with on foot of the Conal Devine report.<\/blockquote> <p>Media reports at the weekend indicate that the communication between the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced three years later, in 2015.  In view of the conflicting information in the public arena and what Mr. O'Brien stated at a previous Committee of Public Accounts meeting, I ask him to come back as urgently as possible, within seven days, to clarify the accuracy or otherwise of his statement to the previous Committee of Public Accounts and the reasons for, and the information he used to arrive at, his conclusions.  We will not have a debate on the matter now.  I am asking for a straight statement to correct the record.  I will not let a debate take place now.  I am not even asking Mr. O'Brien to give a reply now.

He will recall this turn of events.  I am very concerned that he has given inaccurate or misleading information to the committee in respect of the Devine report and what he claimed was a Garda insistence that reports could not be published and disciplinary actions could not be taken against HSE staff on the instruction or advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We now know because of a freedom of information, FOI, request by RTE that in fact there was no communication with the Garda for a full three years.  I am very concerned that Mr. O'Brien was not complete in the information he gave to the committee.  I am concerned also that misleading information has been given to the committee in respect of those staff who were responsible for keeping Grace in that foster home and I want him to clarify that for the committee.  Is it the case that one or all of those responsible still work within the public sector?  We need to know whether that is true.  I am concerned that the allegation - and it has not been refuted - is that what we have witnessed here is what has been described as a clique of HSE managers protecting themselves and the system at the expense of vulnerable children and young adults.  I am concerned by the allegation that records may have been tampered with or destroyed.  I am concerned above all that the public airing of this turn of events, although the turn of events itself goes back further, goes back to 2012 or 2013.  At every stage, Mr. O'Brien was at the helm of the HSE, and it strikes me that he came before the committee and gave, at the very least, incomplete information.  This does nothing to build confidence in him and in the discharge of his duties, if he does not mind my saying so.  It is not acceptable for him to come before an Oireachtas committee and behave in that way.  Therefore, unlike the Chairman, who is giving him seven days to respond to these matters, I think, given the fact that the terms of reference are being debated today in the Houses of the Oireachtas and presumably will be decided at some stage today, it is important that he answer these questions today.  The questions are why he did not give us the full story on the interaction with the Garda, why he gave a bogus explanation of disciplinary actions in respect of HSE staff and why we have been given a contradictory and muddled account as to the whereabouts of those staff members who were responsible for neglecting Grace and leaving her in that very dangerous situation.  I think he must answer these questions today.  I suspect he has all his key people with him and has the information.  I expect him to answer our questions today, answer them fully and answer them truthfully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#G00900","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Is Mr. O'Brien in a position to respond to what has been put to him?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#G01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489050000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>As the Chairman will be aware, the clerk to the committee, presumably at the instigation of the committee, contacted our head of parliamentary affairs to indicate to us that the position would be as the Chairman outlined it.

In the interest of fair procedure, I wish to get the truth, not a quick answer.  This has been ongoing for a very long time, and it is correct that Mr. O'Brien would study closely every one of his previous statements to us on these matters.

Mr. O'Brien has said he will come back within seven days in person, if required.  The D&aacute;il will decide what happens in the D&aacute;il Chamber.

If the Chairman's ruling is as he has outlined, that is his ruling.  However, let us be absolutely honest about this: nobody should hide behind fair procedure or technicalities in the answering of these questions.  Mr. O'Brien and his team are well aware of the debate that has raged around these issues, well aware that the terms of reference are to be considered and, most likely, decided today and well aware, no doubt, from media coverage, that serious question marks have arisen regarding the evidence he has given to the committee.  Therefore, having had the pleasure of Mr. O'Brien's attendance at the committee on many occasions before, I have no doubt but that he would have anticipated this issue raising its head and that he has answers to these matters.

The Act allows the HSE to receive and hold client PPP funds, to use funds for the benefit of clients and to invest funds on clients' behalf.  The 2006 Act requires the HSE to maintain PPP accounts and to produce an annual set of financial statements for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Act also places restrictions on the HSE as to how it can invest PPP funds.  Such funds must be invested with a financial institution regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland or with the National Treasury Management Agency.  As part of the suite of national financial regulations, NFRs, maintained by the HSE to document the system of internal financial control, the HSE has implemented NFR 22 &ndash; patients' private property, which along with a set of patients' private property guidelines, provide detailed instructions to HSE staff on the management of client funds.<\/p> <p>  The HSE established a national co-ordinating unit for PPP, the PPP account central unit, or the central unit, in late 2006.<\/p><p>The central unit received all payments from the health repayment scheme in respect of payments made to clients' PPP accounts.  Department of Social Protection allowances and pensions, approximately 2,500 of them, are also received by the PPPA central unit weekly and lodged to each client's central PPP account.  The weekly statutory contribution pertaining to each client is deducted and moneys are provided for each client to their local care centre as requested depending on client usage.  Excess PPP funds from individual care centres are also transferred to the central unit where those funds can attract interest.  In effect the local care centre PPP account is a current account and the central unit account is a deposit account.<\/p><p> The operation of the PPP process at local level in the 156 units and at central level is subject to external audit by a firm of accountants and there is also an overall audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The HSE has in place a clear programme of work to address the issues arising from these audits.<\/p><p> The PPP system currently supports more than 6,000 adults across older persons, disability and mental health services, with various levels of vulnerability and dependency, to safeguard their moneys and assist with the spending of those moneys for their direct benefit only.  It is an important service for the client but also for family members.<\/p><p> Turning to the health repayment scheme, the 2006 Act was enacted in June 2006 to provide a legal basis for the repayment of long-stay charges for inpatient services which were wrongfully imposed on eligible persons since 1976 under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.  The repayment scheme applies to eligible residents of public long-stay facilities and public contracted beds who were wrongfully charged at the time.<\/p><p> In accordance with the Health (Repayments Scheme) Act 2006, a repayments scheme (donations) fund was set up by the HSE for the purposes of providing improvements in public health services for dependent older persons and persons with disabilities.  Projects undertaken must be once-off improvements and must not incur expenses which would, in the ordinary course of the provision of such public health services, have otherwise been expenses met by an allocation from the Minister for Finance or another Minister of the Government.  Donations received are allocated to the institution or service specified by the donor, subject to the above conditions.<\/p><p> Governance arrangements are in place to ensure that the funds from this donations account are allocated and spent in accordance with the terms of the Act.  The Health Service Executive submits detailed annual accounts of the fund and these accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Interim and regular reports on income and expenditure on the account are available as required.<\/p><p> Since the scheme commenced, a total of 212 donations have been made to date, and the value of donations received from the scheme is &euro;348,000.  All of these funds have now been allocated and expended for their intended purposes and there are no funds in the account at the end of 2016.  As there is a possibility of further payments to be made under the scheme, it is the HSE's view that the donations account must remain in operation until there is a final close of the scheme.<\/p><p> With regard to the health repayment scheme itself, up to the end of December 2016 a total of 35,463 applications have been received.  While the scheme closed to new claimants on the 31 December 2007, there are instances that allow for a follow-on claim to be made.  All 35,463 applications received have been concluded by the end of December 2016 with 21,877 applicants receiving an offer and a further 13,586 applications not accepted.  Based on the 2016 preliminary outturn, a total of 20,283 payments amounting to &euro;453.046 million have been made under the scheme.  <\/p><p> The final cost of the scheme will be in the region of &euro;486 million.  A timeframe for close down of the scheme has yet to be agreed.  The Department of Health in conjunction with the HSE's national co-ordinating unit for the health repayment scheme is currently reviewing the level of potential claims remaining and considering measures necessary to bring the scheme to a closure, including any legislative revisions that may be required.<\/p><p> The nursing homes support scheme is administered by the HSE in accordance with the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  The scheme is administered centrally, with a 2017 net budget of &euro;940 million, and payments in respect of the costs associated with the scheme are made on a named resident basis across public, voluntary and private providers.  The contributions determined under the scheme for individuals are paid directly to the public, private and voluntary providers and the income contributions for those in public centres is included in the revenue income and expenditure accounts of the HSE. <\/p><p> The scheme supported 23,073 people at year-end 2015, rising to 23,142 at year-end 2016.  Of the 23,142 in 2016, 79% are supported in private or voluntary centres and the remaining 21% are supported through public provision. <\/p><p> The briefing paper submitted to the committee outlines in some detail the reasons there are different costs associated with public and private residential care provision under the scheme.  The HSE published its cost of care for public residential care centres in October 2016, with a range of costs generally from &euro;884 to &euro;2,089 per bed per week, when compared with private residential care costs which range from &euro;695 to &euro;1,325 per bed per week.  While this is a significant cost differential for long-stay residential care beds, there are also quite specific different drivers of these costs in evidence. <\/p><p> These include pay rates and conditions of employment of public versus private; the environmental implications of staffing levels in older public centres; the reduction in public beds since 2009 to comply with residential care standards; fixed costs that cannot be easily reduced in line with reductions in bed numbers; higher dependency of residents in public centres; and the necessity to provide public residential care in areas not attractive to private providers.<\/p><p> It is also important to note that public residential care centres are well respected and a vital component of their local community in terms of the delivery of a wide range of services, not just long-stay care.  Many centres are campuses for the delivery of local services, including primary care, day services and rehabilitation.  Public residential care services have a long history of service provision going back generations and the capital plan as announced in 2016 outlined a series of developments across the country in terms of both replacement and refurbishment of existing accommodation to bring the remaining centres in line with the residential care standards.  This will see a significant reduction in multi-occupancy bedrooms, and allow for the provision of services in line with privacy and dignity requirements for residents.<\/p><p> In April 2015, additional funding was provided within an overall package of &euro;74 million to reduce the waiting list for funding approval under the NHSS to no more than a four-week period.  This has been maintained consistently since then and it has provided an essential stability in the overall context of the provision of service to people who require long-term care.<\/p><p> While the NHSS is a significant scheme in supporting older people who need long-term residential care services, it also needs to be viewed in the context of the services that are required to maintain people in their own homes and communities for as long as appropriate.  These services include home care, day care, respite, rehabilitation, voluntary and community supports.  The input of paid and unpaid carers, family and neighbours are important elements of the necessary supports.<\/p><p> The HSE is implementing the recommendations for which it is responsible, following the review of the nursing homes support scheme undertaken in 2015 and will work with the Department of Health in relation to the value-for-money review to be undertaken this year in relation to the costs of public long-stay care services.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The first speaker is Deputy McDonald to be followed by Deputy Madigan.

There are some patients who have capacity and neither need nor want us to mind their patient private property - their own funds.  That is entirely okay with the HSE; it is not a service that we seek to provide.  It is, however, one that we have to provide for some patients and families.  It is quite an extensive service.  We seek to safeguard patients' moneys when they are in our care, particularly those who would not have capacity.  We provide a service which effectively allows them to have their bills paid, have their social welfare money collected, where applicable, and which discharges the contribution that the State requires them to give to the provider, as well as providing their own \"for patient comfort\" moneys or moneys for their own use.  Our guidelines are very explicit.  We make it very clear that this is the patient's money.  If patients want to manage their money themselves and have capacity, that is entirely at their discretion.  Our assumption is that people do have capacity unless there is a reason to doubt it.  That is the why.  We only do it where it is necessary or asked for.  It is not something we insist on.<\/p> <p>  In terms of why we have to pay interest now, in the health board days, the advice the health boards had was that, when they were doing this patient private property service as a service of last resort, their legal relationship to the patient was such that the patient would give the health board some money, and the health board minded the money and gave it back to the patient.  The advice was that the health boards did not have to give interest.  The interest was retained by the health boards to partly offset the costs of providing what is quite an extensive service.  At the time, it was offered in over 170 centres.<\/p> <p>  In around 2004 or 2005, these issues were becoming very topical.  The HSE was on the way in.  As part of the overall preparation for that change, we got further legal advice which said actually, on balance, the relationship is more likely to be that of a trustee.  Trustees are obliged, not just to give back the &euro;100 that was given to them for safekeeping, but also to give interest if it is earned.  We set about putting that in place.  We established a central patient private property unit for data gathering and a repayment scheme.  We have a backlog, in this first instance, of approximately four years' worth of interest, from 2005 to 2008.  We now need to repay this money to patients or, in most cases, to their entitled next of kin.  That is a big logistical exercise and, unfortunately, in many cases we will struggle to find an entitled next of kin.  There is a large piece of work under way to achieve the first two parts of that, namely, the data gathering and calculating the interest. That is to be undertaken this year, I believe.  It will take at least to the end of next year or possibly longer to figure out whom can we pay the money back to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#OO00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":631,"content":"<p>The &euro;14.4 million in interest sounds like an awful lot of money.

As I said, our intent is to get this paid.  The HSE does not want to hold this money.  Our preference would have been to have got to it earlier.

Over the 29 years from 1976 until then, the average interest across all these accounts - remember there are about 18,000 to 20,000 accounts - was less than &euro;1 million per year.  As soon as the charge was suspended in December 2004, patients no longer were making contributions to the cost of their care and the value of money in their accounts went up significantly.  Part of our response was to try to reduce any risk, by bringing money from the local centres into a central point where we could better manage it and give better support to the 170 local centres.  To do something well across 170 centres with all the complexities, particularly when we are talking about deceased patients and probate - it is much better to do the complex stuff centrally.  We established a system in that central unit that gives interest to the accounts automatically when it is earned.  It is a very robust system and is separate from the HSE's accounts.

We will not leave a difference that has an impact on the patient private property accounts because we treat that money as separate and belonging to the patients.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald also asked about the likely 2016 balance.

A system has been in place for years.  An external firm is contracted every year separate from the HSE to audit all 150 or so centres.  It physically attends a large sample and produces a financial statement.  It gives us a list of control breaches.  It also prepares the overall patient private property account which is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Having gone through approximately 70% of the work on the control breaches, my sense is that there are strong controls in place.  No system of control is perfect and cannot be improved, but this one is strong, given how dispersed it is.  More than 90% of the money in question is not in local centres where it is more difficult to exercise control, rather it is in the central unit, the audits of which have never raised a significant issue.

The cost of their employment is lower in these facilities.  That is one part of the equation.  The other part that adds to the difference is the relative complexity of the needs of patients in public nursing homes, where there tends to be a more dependent blend of high to low acuity.  That is not to say some private nursing homes do not also provide for high needs, but typically there is more of that blend in a public nursing home.  That influences the blend of staffing provided.  Typically, there is a richer blend of nursing staff and so on in high-dependency public nursing homes which drives cost.

The breakdown of people being provided for under the scheme has 80% in private institutions and 20% in HSE institutions.  In the past couple of years, a couple of hundred beds have come out of the system and there is no great plan to increase numbers dramatically; there may even be a few more restrictions, depending on the refurbishments that must take place.  With the increasing population, it seems as if the 80:20 split will head to 90% private and 10% public.  The HSE must have done some projections on that.  The executive is not increasing its capacity but the population is increasing.  If the HSE is not providing the extra capacity, it will go to the private sector.  Where does the delegation see the split going if it is now at 80:20?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#RR01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489050000,"counter":713,"content":"<p>There are two components to the issue.  The first is a slightly bigger discussion that we have touched on, which is that we need, over time, to provide for a wider and more sustainable scheme aimed at providing the supports to which many people would prefer to have access to remain living in their own homes and communities rather than in residential nursing care.  This is a discussion we have had with the committee discussing the future of health care.  We also spoke to that committee about the overall capital envelope for the health sector.  As was referenced, a little tangentially, in 2008, before the music stopped, so to speak, we were on track for a level of capital infrastructure development that was double the rate that has occurred in the mean time due to the inability to fund it.  We have put forward very strongly the notion that we must get back to that earlier trajectory, and if we did so we would certainly be looking at the blend of public-private nursing home facilities.<\/p> <p>  There are two reasons for this.  The first is the figure of 21% for public facilities, which is probably as low as we would wish it to go.  There is a requirement for the particular type of care that those facilities can provide that is not as well provided elsewhere.  Additionally, we are the provider of last resort, called upon in circumstances where the regulator is effectively revoking the licence of private providers.  In order to be able to do that, we need to retain a certain core ability from which to call upon to manage those facilities.  Those combined factors, combined with demographic change, mean we are of the view that the total bed stock would need to change.  Under the Department of Health, led by the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, there is an overall capacity review being undertaken this year.  It is often referred to as a hospital capacity review but it is not; it is a system capacity review that will examine bed capability in all sectors.  Our view is we need more beds outside the acute sector.  We may need some in the acute sector but the preponderance should be outside the acute sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#RR01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I get the point.

While other committees are probably examining the issue, it is important that we have an understanding of the full picture.  That is all I am suggesting in this regard.<\/p> <p>  On the nursing home support scheme, the document provided refers at paragraph 4.3 to the determination of the costs of care.  Services not funded under the nursing home support scheme include incontinence wear, chiropody, ophthalmic and dental services.  Surely old people are entitled to have incontinence wear and chiropody covered under the scheme?  Their nails grow and if they are being looked after in an institution, they are entitled to chiropody services.  If an old person needs a new set of false teeth, the cost is not covered.  I will link that issue with people in the institutions who are on medical cards because some of these services are covered by medical cards when the person is living at home.  The medical cards of persons who move into a residential institution become almost redundant.  They are given bed, board and care and nothing else is readily available from the private providers.  Some things that should be covered under a medical card do not seem to be covered.

The paper is based on theoretical frameworks and robust empirical evidence.<br\/><br\/>When I was first approached to speak on the topic, the question of the nature of Irish foreign policy was the first to come to mind.  If Brexit is the independent variable in this political equation - the causal mechanisms that has effects on Irish foreign policy - the question of the nature of the dependent variable remains.  What is Irish foreign policy?  How do we know what is the foreign policy of Ireland?  These questions are central to addressing key questions surrounding the effects of Brexit on Irish foreign policy.<br\/><br\/>The topic of foreign policy assumes the exercise of state sovereignty in the execution of policy aimed at influencing external events and actors in the interests of the state.  This is normally a function undertaken by a government in a democracy on behalf of and reflective of the values identities and interests of a majority of people in the state.  Two parts of the dependent variable issue need to be identified.  The first is what foreign policy is and the second is to which state it relates.  The answer for most people would be self-evident, but I assure the committee that in the case of Irish foreign policy the answers are not what we might expect.  I will explain why.  Before I get into the substance of the presentation, I wish to point out that perhaps the majority of the members of the committee will not like what I have to say.  Nonetheless, I will pull no punches in the presentation in accordance with the needs to put these points on the record for the people.<br\/><br\/>In summary, I have three main points to make.  First, Irish foreign policy today bears no relation whatsoever to the foreign policy of the State as established and practiced in the first 60 years of the existence of the State.  Ten fundamental changes have materialised, five of which involve complete U-turns in policy during the past 40 years, in particular, during the past ten years.  As a result of these U-turns, my analysis can only meaningfully focus on what is left of Irish foreign policy and the future of these remnants in the wake of the UK exit from the European Union.<br\/><br\/>The second point is that the European Union today bears no relation to the form of regional co-operation and organisation established almost 60 years ago in the area of security and defence.  I will outline the radical changes the EU has undergone, especially in respect of the common foreign and security policy and the common security and defence policy.  I will explain how in some ways these have hastened the cause of Brexit and constitute the context that will have significant potential negative effects on what is left of Irish foreign policy.<br\/><br\/>The third point relates to charting the approach of the Government to Brexit based on the evidence of key Brexit discourses.  This also helps to explain why Irish foreign policy has undergone such radical transformation in recent years.  Crucially, it helps to explain why its potential demise in the future is inevitable unless the Government's approach returns to the role expected of it in a normal functioning democracy.  Although this third point is rather foreboding, there is some hope for a turnaround in Irish foreign policy fortunes.  However, the realisation of this hope and goal depends on the response of the members of this committee, the Oireachtas, the media, NGOs and, in particular, the activism of Irish public opinion.<br\/><br\/>I will set out what I referred to as the dependent variable of Irish foreign policy.  Presumably, the point of asking for an analysis of the effects of Brexit on Irish foreign policy implies that there is some merit in seeking to understand what Irish foreign policy will look like in the wake of the UK exit from the EU.<br\/><br\/>To begin, I will focus on an outline of the &quot;before&quot; picture of Irish foreign policy.  Although Ireland was an identifiable nation for many centuries, there was no official Irish foreign policy due to lack of statehood, autonomy and independence.  Despite the absence of sovereign representation and agency, we can know the values and identity of Irish foreign policy through the discourses and practices of pivotal Irish leaders throughout our nation's long history, namely, Theobald Wolfe Tone in the 1700s; Daniel O'Connell in the 1800s; and P&aacute;draic Pearse, James Connolly and Se&aacute;n Lester in the early 1900s.<br\/><br\/>Having established independent statehood in the wake of numerous rebellions, including the Easter Rising of 1916, the War of Independence and the subsequent Civil War, we can identify the official ethos and elements of Irish foreign policy through the discourses and practices of official State figures, such as the former Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken, and the former Taoiseach, &Eacute;amon de Valera, up until the mid-1900s.  There is a remarkable consistency of the ethos and elements of Irish foreign policy in the discourses and practices of these leaders over several centuries.<br\/><br\/>In two key periods, the early 1960s and the early 2000s, this consistency was broken and most elements of Irish foreign policy were abandoned and replaced, respectively, with European-mandated strictures in the context of Ireland's pursuit of membership of the European Economic Community and the European Union legally created by the Lisbon treaty.  As a result, Irish foreign policy is now characterised by a struggle between the Government supporting interests-based EU common security and defence policy ambitions in contrast to State actors, such as mass public opinion, NGOs and non-governmental political parties, all of whom continue to adhere to the centuries-long norms of Irish foreign policy, such as independence and the values associated with neutrality.<br\/><br\/>What is Irish foreign policy today?  When I explored the elements of Irish foreign policy norms through several centuries, I found that in the 1700s and 1800s peace within and outside Ireland was seen to be dependent on Irish independence.  I will outline the foreign policy norms of Wolfe Tone and O'Connell.  First, they were accorded through the values and policies of self-determination; anti-imperialism; Third World solidarity, in the form of being against African slavery and black racism in the USA; the rejection of famine, whether war-induced or political; slavery; and anti-war attitudes.  Second, they were accorded through a reliance on international engagement and diaspora.  Third, the norms served the need for justice, rights, resistance, non-retaliation, religious tolerance and the emancipation of the subjugated.  Fourth, the norms were based on a patriotism that was almost exclusively Irish, themed with non-belligerency and non- aggression.  Fifth, the norms were linked to the notion of a just war and neutrality in seeking to avoid being dragged into the wars of Britain and other great powers.<br\/><br\/>After the 1916 Rising and the establishment of an independent state, &Eacute;amon de Valera repeated these central norms of Irish foreign policy as articulated by Wolfe Tone, O'Connell and de Valera's 1916 comrade, P&aacute;draic Pearse.  He said that Ireland's contribution to world peace was based on the nation's self-determination and independence and that the corollary of Ireland's self-determination and independent was peace with neighbours and the world.<br\/><br\/>Gaining independence gave Ireland several options.  It permitted the inclusion of these norms at the level of the individual, such as a personal rejection of conscription.  It provoked an intensification of the norms of self-determination, independence, anti-imperialism and multi-level international engagement, including with diaspora.  Furthermore, it added the opportunity to pursue several goals.  I will outline these goals.  The first was normative-based global institutional co-operative engagement.  This was specifically conditional on the purpose and effectiveness of the engagement.  The second was a constitutional commitment to peaceful resolution of disputes.  The third was armed neutrality.  The fourth related to the policies of UN peacekeeping.  The fifth related to decolonisation.  The sixth related to disarmament.  The seventh related to anti-big power politics.  The eighth related to non-membership of military alliances.  The ninth related to an untied development aid policy underpinned by solidarity with the developing world as well as non-governmental organisation and missionary links.  The tenth related to the facilitation of a normative, globally-focused Irish patriotism specifying that a good Irish patriot is a good member of the global community and an apostle for the rule of law in international affairs.  I will return to this patriotism in the final part of my presentation.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's history of oppression is infused with her peace policy ethos and norms as well as her contribution to the world in the context of the conception of her national role.  The 1980s was the last time the Government held that neutrality permitted what it termed the positive merits of Irish foreign policy.  These merits included UN peacekeeping, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, decolonisation narratives or initiatives, opposing South African apartheid, accepting refugees, opposing US funding of South American paramilitaries, increasing aid to the Third World, and supporting Palestinian self-determination.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned, there have been several Irish foreign policy reversals and shifts in policy.  Given the time constraints, I only have time to advert to five of these.  The first policy reversal was the extension of EU political co-operation into military affairs.  Until the end of the 1980s, successive Governments were against any EC role in military affairs or security and defence policy.  This was affirmed in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Collins:<\/p><blockquote>Our positive neutrality is aimed at the promotion of peace as has been clearly established already by Ireland's traditional attitude to decolonisation, disarmament and peace-keeping issues in the United Nations.<br \/><br \/>It is being suggested that European political co-operation should be extended to military affairs. We are totally opposed to this idea.<\/blockquote><p>The second reversal was the merger of the Western European Union, WEU, military alliance with the EU, and the third was signing up to the WEU's mutual defence clause or any version of a collective defence commitment.  Again, that was stated in the D&aacute;il.  By the early 2000s, however, the Government had reversed all three positions.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the second policy reversal, namely, the WEU-EU merger, in June 1995 the governing Christian Democrats and the then German Foreign Minister, Mr. Klaus Kinkel, separately called for the EU to play a more significant defence role, proposing the gradual merger of the EU with the WEU, the European arm of NATO, and demanded the neutral states join it.  In opposition, the then Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Mr. Bertie Ahern, rejected the WEU-EU merger planned for inclusion in the Amsterdam Treaty.  He stated, &quot;We do not want to see the EU-WEU amalgamation or the incorporation in the treaty of alliance obligations or nuclear doctrines.&quot;  In Government offices some months later, on 15 June 1999, the then Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fianna F&aacute;il's David Andrews, stated in the Dail that the question of integration of the WEU as an institution into the EU was problematic and should be dropped, and that the related issue of the WEU's Article V mutual defence commitment should be left to one side.  At EU level, however, the Ahern-led Government had actually agreed to the WEU-EU merger in 1999, including the final element, which was the transfer of the Article V mutual defence clause to the EU.  This happened through the draft 2004 constitution for Europe, which was reconstituted as the Lisbon Treaty and ratified by the Irish Government in 2009.<br\/><br\/>The third policy reversal concerns Ireland's WEU membership and the assumption of its mutual defence clause.  Ireland's WEU membership through the &quot;back door&quot; of a merger of the WEU with the EU overturned official Government policy stated in the White Paper on foreign policy in 1996.  It stated, &quot;the Government will not be proposing that Ireland should seek membership of NATO or the Western European Union, or the assumption of their mutual defence guarantees.&quot;  This was subsequently reiterated by the Ahern-led Government in Parliament when it was stated &quot;Ireland was not a member of the WEU and had no intention of joining it.&quot;  Past Irish leaders would have resisted the undemocratic, dishonest and potentially patronage-ridden tactics employed by the four big EU powers to secure the merger.  The paper goes into that detail.<br\/><br\/>The fourth foreign policy reversal concerns the meaning of the concept of &quot;military neutrality&quot;.  By early 2004, neutrality had been narrowed down to a definition comprising the non-membership of &quot;pre-existing military alliances with mutual automatic obligations&quot;.  To fit the neutrals' proposed constitutional amendment for states' military responses to be optional rather than automatic, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Brian Cowen, had proposed to the EU that the wording should be, &quot;it may request that the other Member States give it aid and assistance by all the means in their power&quot;.  The Irish Government and those of other neutral-states failed to have their amendment adopted during the negotiations over the constitution.  The WEU's automatic mutual defence clause was inserted into the full text of the constitution that became the Lisbon Treaty, which, once ratified, resulted in the eradication of Irish &quot;military&quot; neutrality and effectively changed the Government's military neutrality concept to mean membership of this merged WEU military alliance.<br\/><br\/>The fifth and final policy reversal I will talk about concerns adopting what was called the &quot;sharp end of peacekeeping&quot; in the Petersberg Tasks and NATO-led missions.  Mr. Bertie Ahern had agreed with the statement in the 1996 White Paper on foreign policy that &quot;neutrality has come to be regarded as a touchstone in terms of our approach to international relations&quot; and he added that &quot;we are under no obligation to associate with pre-existing Cold War and nuclear based military alliances, even for peace-keeping purposes.&quot;  Mr. Ahern reversed this policy seemingly without any level of serious debate regarding the legitimacy or effectiveness of PfP-linked NATO peace support or WEU Petersberg Tasks crisis management operations, stating a need to accept what he called organisational realities in Europe and the settled preference of all our partners to work mainly with and through existing structures in developing the European common foreign and security policy, CFSP.  These are effectively the WEU and NATO.  The Government was more concerned with constructing the EU as a global actor, seen through its claim that Ireland should participate to &quot;signal the strength of the EU's capability to undertake a robust and large-scale mission.&quot;<br\/><br\/>Academics argue that the Irish Government has been neither honest nor realistic in executing &quot;a clear move away from traditional UN operations in favour of the post Cold War model of 'tendered out' or delegated peace support operations.&quot;  Neutral states have traditionally resisted power politics and high-intensity military operations, to the extent of questioning the motivations behind interventions in the Middle East, Africa and Asia by larger powers during the Cold War era.  It is supposed that, in the post-Cold War era, &quot;the end of purely alliance-driven policies left more space for an altruistic or value-driven foreign policy&quot;.  Ireland's attributes as a neutral, post-colonial state with no history of interference or exploitation in other states makes her a good peacekeeper and potentially a provider of good offices in conflict resolution.  However, uncritical involvement in interests-oriented CSDP robust military interventions in Europe's near abroad will reduce Ireland's standing and defeat ethical foreign policy goals.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to the second part of my paper to consider the EU's ethos of a CFSP and a common security and defence policy, CSDP.  Professor Giandomenico Majone is an academic who has written extensively on the EU.  In this book, he states he has identified EU operating principles.  The first is that integration has priority over all other competing values, including democracy, and the second is that EU decision-makers follow, wherever possible, the strategy of a <i>fait accompli<\/i>- the accomplished fact that makes opposition and public debate useless.  The third is that ultimate ends are largely irrelevant.  What counts, according to Professor Majone, are procedures and the expansion of European competences.  He is largely correct.  These strategies have been in evidence throughout the decision-making on EU policies, such as the introduction of monetary union, to the merger of the final elements of the WEU military alliance with the EU through the adoption of its mutual defence clause through Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Lisbon Treaty.  They are exemplified in the traumas inflicted on this State from multiple repeat referendums on Nice and Lisbon treaties, which were rejected due to the fact their foreign policy elements were seen to violate fundamental principles of Irish foreign policy and neutrality, to the imposition of an &euro;85 billion debt on this State, which has been used to pay for what is arguably the reckless behaviour of financial institutions based on Wall Street that are still unregulated today.<br\/><br\/>Turning to foreign policy, the European Commission and Council have sought the eradication of neutrality.  My paper goes into detail on this.  Mr. Charles Haughey argued the following in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann from the Opposition benches:<\/p><blockquote>Those who consciously or unconsciously are seeking to force us to abandon our neutrality are foolish in failing to appreciate the potential value of Irish neutrality to the Community in the international arena.  Our neutrality emphasises the peaceful nature of the Community ...<\/blockquote><p>Arguably, successive Irish leaders have failed to resist the demands from the EU to eradicate Irish neutrality.<br\/><br\/>The European Commission was equally hostile to the continuation of Austrian, Finnish and Swedish neutrality during their accession negotiations and suggested neutrality be effectively defined out of existence because of its incompatibility with future EU defence policy.  The concept was narrowed to just one characteristic, non-membership of a military alliance, which meant the broader &quot;active&quot; neutrality policy attributes were stripped out.  It was renamed &quot;military neutrality&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In October 2002, the European Commission identified a new priority as an information topic for dissemination, &quot;the role of the European Union in the World&quot;.  The EU's CSDP main objective is enhancing the EU's image as a global actor.  As Alyson Bailes said, regarding the genesis of the European security and defence policy, ESDP, in 1999, no one talked much at the time about doing something for the &quot;good of the world&quot; and many people were thinking about the good of Europe.<br\/><br\/>Arguably, the ESDP and CSDP are driven by France's desire to create a &quot;<i>Europe puissance<\/i>&quot; or European superpower against the <i>&quot;hyperpuissance<\/i>&quot; or hyper-power United States of America in the context of a perceived unipolar world created by the end of the Cold War.<br\/><br\/>One of the reasons for the lack of a common foreign policy at the EU level and the slower development of an EU military capabilities, which should be capable of rivalling US capabilities, is the United Kingdom's traditional respect for what it calls the &quot;special relationship&quot; with USA and a desire to maintain NATO as a priority over and above the EU military alliances created by the WEU-EU merger.<\/p><p>With the UK exiting the EU&rsquo;s common security and defence policy, CSDP, as part of Brexit, Ireland will be missing the one big state partner that was aligned with its own interests in trying to slow down the militarisation plans put in place for the EU to create what Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso has called a &ldquo;post-imperialist&quot; empire.  <br\/><br\/>The EU-funded Ireland for Europe lobbying organisation, which campaigns to persuade Irish people to vote &quot;Yes&quot; to EU treaties in referendum campaigns, has pointed out that Ireland has never chosen to use its veto in EU negotiations.  This is in contrast to countries like Denmark, a similarly sized state with a similar population, which has regularly exercised its veto and has actually opted out of the CSDP to protect its perceived interests.  Ireland&rsquo;s inability and unwillingness to use its veto, combined with the lack of the restraining effect of the UK on French and German military ambitions through the EU after Brexit, means that Ireland will, without doubt, acquiesce in becoming part and parcel of the EU's CSDP.  She will, at best, abstain from military missions under permanent structured co-operation if they are not aligned with Irish foreign policy values and at worst, participate in such missions to be considered truly European or &quot;one of the lads&quot;.<br\/><br\/>On 14 November 2016, the Council of the European Union adopted conclusions setting out the level of ambition and the way forward on the future development of EU security and defence policy and on implementing the EU's global strategy in this area.  The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the head of the European Defence Agency, EDA, proposed an implementation plan on security and defence in October 2016.  A European Commission report is forthcoming, entitled the European defence action plan, and the leaders of the institutions of the EU and NATO concluded a joint declaration which was signed in Warsaw recently.  <br\/><br\/>We must remember that the CSDP is an intergovernmental policy at EU level and the European Parliament has no role whatsoever in terms of decision-making.  European Parliament co-decision had been a key demand of pro-EU campaigners in Irish referendum discourses, linked to their demand that the Irish people should fully support the EU's CSDP, but such democratic oversight through the European Parliament has never been achieved.  <br\/><br\/>The EU seeks to develop the arms industry in Europe through establishing a European defence technological and industrial base, EDTIB.  It seeks to &ldquo;be able to respond with rapid and decisive action through the whole spectrum of crisis management tasks covered by Article 43&quot; of the Treaty on European Union, TEU.  The European Council highlights the importance of the mutual defence clause in Article 42.7 of the TEU in the achievement of this goal, along with the practice of CSDP missions or operations outside the EU&rsquo;s borders.  These missions require member states to allocate a sufficient level of expenditure for defence, as called for by the European Council in June 2015.  The Council is seeking enhanced EU financial instruments, as well as &ldquo;financial solidarity and other forms of burden sharing&rdquo; for this purpose, which sounds like an ambition to introduce an instrument for defence spending similar to the eurozone's European Stability Mechanism, ESM, to which Ireland has committed &euro;11 billion worth of assets.  The European Commission President, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, has made no secret of the fact that he seeks &ldquo;a new approach to building a European security union with the end goal of establishing a European army&rdquo; and a number of German Government figures backed this call in November 2016.  In this respect, the EU is attempting to put in place the European defence community that was called for before the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community and EURATOM in the 1950s.<br\/><br\/> Finally, I wish to deal with the Irish Government's approach to Brexit and the consequences for Irish foreign policy.  I see some contrasting values and interests of the Irish and British Governments in their respect leaders&rsquo; Brexit speeches, that is, the speeches of the British Prime Minister, Theresa May and the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny.  In his Brexit speech, entitled, Ireland at the Heart of a Changing European Union, which was delivered on 15 February 2017, the Taoiseach said the following:<\/p><blockquote>We are being buffeted by strong external forces &mdash; of politics, of economics and of technology.  The greatest of these, of course, is Brexit. ... We must make sure that we shape that future for ourselves.  I firmly believe that we can.  My purpose today is to explain how. <\/blockquote><p>He went on to say that in 2016:<\/p><blockquote>as we commemorated the Centenary of the Easter Rising, we recalled the achievements of the revolutionary generation. ... It was a year of renewal &mdash; renewal of our sense of ourselves and of the values we hold dear.  It is those enduring Irish values that will guide us safely through the stormy seas in the years ahead.  The values of freedom and democracy, of openness, of tolerance, of community, of solidarity and of respect for others.<\/blockquote><p>As members may notice, the Taoiseach's list of Irish values omits the 1916 values of anti-imperialism, independence, global patriotism and solidarity, specifically with colonised and decolonising nations.  The Taoiseach went on to say:<\/p><blockquote>our values are European values, too.  They are the common values that animate our European Union.  They are the values that bind us together as a Union of democratic states, working together for the greater good of our common European home.  <\/blockquote><p>My central point is that this narrative fails to recognise that in some respects, European Union foreign policy is driven by French foreign policy ambitions, cloaked in European multilateralism, to achieve &quot;great power&quot; or &quot;global actor&quot; status to rival US &quot;hyper-puissance&quot;.  These are not Irish foreign policy values in a traditional sense.  The Taoiseach continued thus:<\/p><blockquote>Three years after the Rising, in 1919, the First D&aacute;il met to formally declare our independence. ... But that message contained an essential and abiding truth about Ireland &mdash; we are a European island nation.<\/blockquote><p>The Taoiseach is wrong because what the &quot;Message to the Free Nations of the World&rdquo; actually said was that Ireland: <\/p><blockquote>believes in freedom and justice as the fundamental principles of international law, because she believes in a frank co-operation between the peoples for equal rights against the vested privileges of ancient tyrannies, because the permanent peace of Europe can never be secured by perpetuating military dominion for the profit of empire but only by establishing the control of government in every land upon the basis of the free will of a free people.<\/blockquote><p>These are the values, namely, resisting vested interests and ensuring peace in Europe through national sovereignty based on what the people of Ireland want in terms of their foreign policy.  <br\/><br\/>The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on 6 December 1921.  On 19 December 1921, Arthur Griffith said in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<\/p><blockquote>It is the first Treaty that admits the equality of Ireland. ... We have brought back to Ireland her full rights and powers of fiscal control.<\/blockquote><p>Successive Governments have actually given up control of this State&rsquo;s fiscal policy through the EU bailout programme, which is something I go into forensic detail in my longer paper.  These decisions on fiscal sovereignty indicate the fate of what is left of Irish foreign policy, which may also be sacrificed for the EU&rsquo;s ambitions.  <br\/><br\/> In his Brexit speech, the Taoiseach argued that as members of &quot;a Union with other like-minded democracies who share our values and interests, we have a much more powerful voice on the global stage&quot;.  However, I would argue that we have diluted our voice on the global stage to align with EU interests.  I provide in my paper the example of a reversal of Irish policy on Palestine.  In July 2014 Ireland abstained in a UN General Assembly vote calling for a Gaza inquiry.  A media report by Shona Murray explaining this change in Irish foreign policy claims it was:<\/p><blockquote>a strategic vote to abstain, in line with all EU members, who are members of the Human Rights Council.  The reason why they say they did that is because this draft resolution didn&rsquo;t pertain to investigating breaches of international humanitarian law on both aides, and it didn&rsquo;t explicitly condemn the firing of rockets from Hamas into Israel.<\/blockquote><p>In fact, the resolution did explicitly condemn the firing of rockets into Israel.  This is just one among several examples that stand in contrast to the Taoiseach's claim that &ldquo;our interests are absolutely best served from within the Union&rdquo;.  <br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach also said the following:<\/p><blockquote>If we believe in a vision of a bright future for our continent and for our European values, then we must place that vision at the heart of our discussions.  Otherwise, we will be playing into the hands of those who do not share those values, or that vision.  But let me also make one thing absolutely clear &ndash; Ireland will be on the EU side of the table when the negotiations begin.  We will be one of the 27.<\/blockquote><p>I argue that in this adopted identity as a &quot;European island&quot; rather than a &quot;global island&quot;, the latter being in the title of the last official position statement on Irish foreign policy by this State, the Taoiseach has failed to recognise that the job of the leader of this State is to defend Irish values and interests and to be on the side of Ireland when negotiating Brexit.<br\/><br\/>I will also touch on the future of Irish foreign policy post-Brexit, as that is where the meat of the discussion will be after this presentation.  Ireland is now called one of the PIIGS, or Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, after the bailout debacle.  I argue, although it is controversial, that the real pigs are the successive Irish leaders, who could be named &quot;Napoleon&quot; or &quot;Squealer&quot;, while the people of the nation are reflected in other <i>Animal Farm<\/i>characters like the horses, &quot;Boxer&quot; and &quot;Clover&quot;.  The EU common foreign and security policy and common security and defence policy, as they are currently developed and as they will develop according to stated EU plans, are arguably incompatible with Irish foreign policy values of anti-militarism, anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, independence based on a resistance to big power foreign policy agendas, peace promotion impartiality and solidarity with other smaller decolonised and decolonising nations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Devine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":832,"content":"<p>There is much material there for consideration and I am quite sure some of it would be contested as well.

There are many issues and a great many implications of Brexit for Irish foreign policy.  As she said, she is really just touching on some of them in her paper.  It is interesting that she emphasises the flaws in EU governance and the implications of EU membership for Irish neutrality.  I would disagree with her or take issue with some of her statements, as she might have expected.  I could not accept that military neutrality for Ireland has been eradicated and most Irish people would be slightly horrified to take that view.  Ireland is and remains a neutral country, and we are not the only neutral country in the EU.<\/p> <p>  Forgive me if I have misinterpreted Dr. Devine's comments but I understood her to say that while the UK has been a member of the EU, it has effectively amounted to being a defender of Ireland's neutrality.  I cannot accept that but perhaps I misunderstood the witness.  It is not right to see the EU as a sort of monolithic entity.  The EU is clearly an amalgam of member states with very different approaches to issues around neutrality and foreign policy.  We are one of the EU member states in that way.  On the left, many of us have struggled with a view of Europe and we have been very critical of aspects of European governance, particularly the \"Fortress Europe\" mentality and the way in which the EU failed abjectly to come up with a way of welcoming refugees from war-torn countries like Syria and so on.  I am absolutely in agreement with Dr. Devine on the critique I imagine she might make in that regard.  However, given the changed political climate in the past year internationally, with President Trump in the US, the growing power and dominance of Mr. Putin in Russia and the major fear that many citizens in EU member states in central and eastern Europe are feeling about EU encroachment, as we have seen with Georgia, I am very concerned.  We need to start acknowledging the EU can be a very progressive force and counterbalance to the growing might of the US and Russia, with very authoritarian regimes now in place in both those countries.  The EU is seen by many across the world, notably in Syria and other war-torn countries, as a bastion of democracy.<\/p> <p>  There is another articulation of EU values that is true.  I agree with much of Dr. Devine's critique but we must also acknowledge there are many other impetuses at work within the EU.  Many of us are highly critical of Chancellor Merkel's policies in many ways but nonetheless all of us respect the way in which Germany took in 1 million Syrian refugees and tried to encourage EU member states to take a similarly welcoming approach to policy to refugees.  I am sorry to go on but I feel passionately about this.  My own family background is from the Czech Republic and I also have family in Croatia.  As many on the left did, I grappled with the concept of military intervention in the war in Bosnia.  I now believe it unfortunate the EU did not intervene more strongly in that appalling war and genocide, particularly when we saw the treatment of the Bosnian people in particular.  We must be careful about assuming certain monolithic ideas about Europe.  We must acknowledge it is more complex or nuanced than that.  The EU can and should in many ways form a counter-power to authoritarian regimes that we can see in place in the US and Russia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#E00500","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":836,"content":"<p>I know Dr. Devine has time constraints because of college commitments.

She stated at the start she would pull no punches and she certainly did not.  She indicated she hoped for a turnaround in Irish foreign policy fortunes but that the realisation of that goal depends on the response of members of this committee.  She was somewhat flattering in that respect.  We have not seen such independent thought coming through in this committee but perhaps it will happen this term because of changes within the Oireachtas.  More voices could give a different opinion on the way things are going.  The witness indicates change depends on the wider Oireachtas and the media.  There is no real evidence of such change apart from in some non-governmental organisations and in the activism of Irish public opinion.  I remember attending the demonstrations against the war in Iraq, which had 100,000 Irish people walking on the streets.  That was a huge number.  The Taoiseach of the day was allegedly knocking on doors in Drumcondra at the time and there was not much leadership at the time in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The witness probably has too many ideas in her paper for such a small timeframe.  It is refreshing and I wish we had more time to discuss some of her ideas.<\/p><p>Dr. Devine spoke about Ireland's inability and unwillingness to use its EU veto, a point also raised by Senator Bacik.  Why have we become acquiescent and part and parcel of the French-led new imperialist common security and defence policy, CSDP?  Why is there a reluctance to use the veto?  Is it because we want to be seen as the good boys and girls of Europe?  Are there wider implications in that we will trade off this in the hope of getting support in some other area?<\/p><p> The British Government had been a block in attempts to federalise the EU further.  It was coming from its own position on this.  While I might not necessarily agree with it, there was a view from many that this was a negative development.  The EU institutions have continually ignored all polls and data which show people opposed to federalisation while trust and support for the EU is falling.  There is widespread anger at the democratic deficit in the EU.  Have the EU institutions learned anything from the Brexit vote and the growing resentment towards the EU?  After the British decision, will it instead move quickly towards further federalisation?  That is a concern many of us have.<\/p><p> Earlier, listening to the radio, I heard people talking about how there will be a change of gravity with Britain leaving the EU.  To a large extent, the British have this idea of themselves as the centre of gravity and everything flows from them.  From discussions with some of their representatives, it is obvious they do not have a clue what is coming down the track.  That is the difficulty.  However, there will be changes in Europe.  Is it a concern that this voice will not be there?  While the British voice may have come from a different angle from ours, it put a block on many issues, particularly federalisation.<\/p><p> Traditionally, Britain blocked efforts to create an EU army or military force.  It was of the view that there was nothing better than its own army and it would see itself as a great peacekeeper.  However, that depends on where one lives.  If one lived in this part of the word, one might have different view.  We have also seen the creation of EU battle groups and joint EU missions abroad.  The leaders of the EU institutions have long stated their desire for an EU army.  Ministers always say that is not the direction we are going, but it seems we are moving incrementally towards that.  This week, the EU agreed to create a new military headquarters in Brussels and there has been agreement that a percentage of the budget would be spent on greater militarisation in all EU states.  This is happening at a time when people are living through austerity.  Does Dr. Devine believe we will see an acceleration of efforts to create that EU army?  Again, that is a concern that many of us have.  I know she is on record about her concerns about Irish neutrality and military planes landing at Shannon Airport as part of a forwarding base for military operations around the world.  She did not allude to it in her paper but does see it as an issue.  I know Dr. Devine has a significant background in Irish neutrality.  Does she think this will impact on the Irish Government's supposed policy of neutrality?  Does she think this will mean we will no longer continue the pretence?  Will legislation for Irish neutrality, such as through a referendum, be introduced?  Will we give up these public statements on neutrality?  Is it too soon for Irish politicians to acquiesce in that?<\/p><p> There have been big changes in the US with significant developments on the other side of the election of Donald Trump.  Does Dr. Devine believe the British Government's focus will shift to creating stronger ties with the new American regime?  Will it be a temporary arrangement or a long-term shift in alliances?  Will the British prioritise such a relationship over their relationship with the European Union?  How will this impact on Irish foreign policy?<\/p><p> The Government, as well as other political parties and groupings, have conducted a significant amount of outreach to other EU Governments on the unique situation of Ireland with regard to Brexit.  Last week, we had the historic elections in the North with a significant focus on the DUP.  Brexit was also part of the reason for the high voter turnout.  Does Dr. Karen Devine believe that a core priority of the Government's foreign affairs policy must be to ensure the North receives a special status in the European Union?  This is one of these developing positions.  The Irish Parliament has adopted a position on this special category.  How would such a special category status be viewed in other European capitals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#E00700","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489050000,"counter":839,"content":"<p>I thank members for their questions and feedback.

Does one become more embedded in the thinking or does one become more critical?  In the case of Ireland, the evidence shows that the elites have become more embedded.  For me, that is why I question why the Taoiseach has to divide it into the binary of the UK versus the rest.  Ireland, traditionally, has had some alignment with UK policy, such as a refusal to join in the harmonisation of corporate tax rates.  On fisheries in the 1980s, the UK was our biggest partner in preventing continued encroachment with the extension of the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, of Irish fisheries grounds.  Ireland and the UK have had several alliances in areas such as tax, economics, fisheries and with the CSDP.  To pre-empt a point raised by Senator Bacik, the UK has not protected Irish neutrality.  I did not mean to give that impression earlier.  For diametrically opposed reasons, the UK and Ireland have always had a position of trying to prevent or delay the continued defence integration of the EU.  Ireland wanted to protect its neutrality while the UK wanted to protect the special relationship with the US and have NATO as the primary security collective defence agency for it and the EU.<\/p> <p>  As Brexit has such serious consequences for this country, I would rather see our leader saying what the Irish strategy will be and not to be co-opted continually into this notion.  The Taoiseach even said we have to be careful because our European values are under threat.  In his speech, he mentioned there was some kind of feeling at a Council meeting that somehow these values were under threat and had to be defended.  The idea that the UK, by exiting the EU, is somehow reversing its own values and undermining European ones is not true.<\/p><p>I did not refer to Prime Minister May's speech, but it is mentioned in the larger paper.  She discussed Britain being a &quot;global Britain&quot;.  It was written on her podium when she spoke, it was the title of her paper and it was on the background.  She stated that she wanted the UK to be more globally focused.  I included so much detail on people like Wolfe Tone and Daniel O'Connell from the 1700s and 1800s because Ireland has traditionally been a globally focused island.  I see no harm in that, but what I read from the Taoiseach's speeches is that it is all about &quot;us&quot; against the UK with Ireland's position omitted.  We are the nation that is most vulnerable to Brexit.  We are the nation that should be trying to drive and lead these negotiations instead of following along with the defensiveness that has been evident among the elite in the EU since the referendum result on 26 June 2016.<br\/><br\/>Opt-outs were referenced.  There are opt-out areas beyond security and defence.  Schengen and Justice and Home Affairs have been mentioned.  Contrary to one of the myths propagated in Irish referendum discourses, though, Ireland has no opt-outs from the common security and defence policy, CSDP, and it never sought them.  The Seville declaration is a strategy employed by the Government.  It was a political declaration and has no legal standing whatsoever.  It was simply a statement by the then members of the European Council that there would be a referendum held in Ireland on the question of military neutrality.  It did not actually reference neutrality, but neutrality has always underpinned the State's foreign policy, not the Government's narrow concept of military neutrality, which just means not being a member of a pre-existing military alliance.  In my presentation, I argued that this had been reversed, given that we were a part of the Western European Union, WEU, military alliance, which was subsumed into the EU.  That merger was always a part of the plan of the Germans and French.  The Seville declaration does not respect neutrality.<br\/><br\/>I remember a point arising from surveys.  I cited Professor Giandomenico Majone, a retired researcher at the European University Institute in Florence, which is the EU's effective university.  He is extremely pro-EU and wrote his book from that perspective.  However, his view on how the EU takes its decisions means that Ireland has not been able to secure the notion of unity in diversity.  Although Brian Cowen attempted to water down the mutual defence clause during the 2003 negotiations on the draft constitution for Europe, which turned into the Lisbon treaty, he did not get his way.  In coalition with Austria, Sweden and Finland, he tried to make the mutual defence clause non-automatic in terms of obliging Ireland to commit by all means in its power to the defence of a state that might come under attack, but they failed because that was the agenda of the Germans and the French, who want to create a hyper <i>pr&eacute;sence<\/i>for the EU and to make it a global actor.  It has always been pointed in that direction, which the debate in Ireland has ignored.  We are constantly told the opposite, namely, that we are not headed towards an EU army.  However, having read the writings of Jean Monnet, the original European federalist, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission today, that is the goal.<br\/><br\/>Senator Bacik is correct about the EU being an area of security and peace for individuals fleeing wartorn zones, but that is not central to the ethos of the CSDP's development.  A point is omitted in the debates.  A gentleman by the name of Michael Hudson, an economics professor at the University of Missouri at Kansas City in the US, has pointed out that the big power member states of the EU that are making pronouncements on Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas of the Middle East where problems have created the refugee crisis have actually been helping to create those war conditions.  The Senator referred to how Russia was a growing power.  This forms part of the geopolitical discourse.  As Professor Hudson points out, Russia offered to reconcile with Europe in the post-Cold War era.  It sought a trade agreement.  The idea of joining NATO was even floated once.<br\/><br\/>Military resources are not the answer to a flood of refugees.  An entirely different approach is required.  Trying to act as a global power that defuses situations rather than builds them into &quot;us versus them&quot; scenarios would have a greater effect and be more in line with the traditional values of Irish foreign policy.  Our Constitution refers to a peaceful resolution of disputes.  Too much has been invested in creating the industrial arms base of the EU.  The arms industry is worth billions of euro to the EU and across the Atlantic in the US.  From the EU's perspective, I can understand the notion that it does not want to have to keep buying US arms and the suggestion that it should have its own industrial base.  For example, Sweden has a large arms industry whereas Ireland does not.<br\/><br\/>My problem is that if the EU wanted to create a global actor with the capability to intervene militarily in its near abroad, in whose interest would that be done?  The failure in the development of the CSDP has been in the input of the European Parliament.  It was always supposed to have an input, but instead we have the classic <i>realpolitik<\/i>and Cold War legacy of not letting people know about security and defence policy.  This is what we call &quot;high politics&quot;, and it is hived off.

He was a Labour Party MEP.  He stated that the future incarnation of CSDP would be a great thing and should be supported, but that he would only agree to its development if the European Parliament had co-decision powers.  He was explicit.  The Parliament has no say.  Twice a year, it calls on Ms Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to give a statement, but it has no decision-making power.  It does not even have the power of consultation.  That is a major flaw.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the notion that the EU as a larger entity would, for example, counterbalance Trump in the USA and the fear of eastern European states, in which context Senator Bacik mentioned Georgia, consider the intervention in Libya, which was supposed to solve problems but created a situation similar to the one in Syria.  The problem is that power politics have not left NATO and the EU.  In whose interest is that?  Several academics have analysed why the EU intervened in the missions in Africa.  Professor Gorm Rye Olsen is one of them.  After examining seven missions in total, he found that there had essentially been a gentlemen's agreement between the UK and France that the EU's foreign policy would only get involved in those areas of Africa that had been carved out as British or French colonies.  They agreed that if either wanted to use the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, to do something in Africa, it would be okay as long as the other was allowed to do the same in respect of its former colonial states.  Professor Olsen pointed to the good in these human interventions, but that strategic geopolitical interests rather than humanitarianism were the primary goal.  Consider France in Chad, for example.<\/p><p>The French already had military there supporting the government in Chad and there was an issue.  Even French NGOs pointed to the lack of neutrality in the intervention in Chad, particularly with French forces already being there.  For me, we need to have a space where we can question the <i>realpolitik<\/i>and the real interests that could be at stake if the EU decided to develop this capability.<br\/><br\/>In relation to Deputy Crowe's questions, of which I counted nine - I enjoyed all of them - the Deputy is correct that there is too much in the paper.  It is one of my failings as an academic that I always go on too long.  The wider paper, hopefully, will provide more forensic evidence and detail on what I am trying to say.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Deputy Crowe on most of the points he made in that there is no evidence that the media is an activist for Irish foreign policy.  I also noticed this, particularly in relation to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>which has always regarded itself as &quot;the paper of record&quot;.  There was a journalist, whose name escapes me, who was always clear in his reporting.  As a student in the early 1990s in UCD and in Limerick, I always followed his reports on what was happening at EU level in terms of European political co-operation and then, after the Maastricht treaty was passed and ratified in 1993, the notion of the common security and defence policy, and later the common foreign policy.  He was always quite accurate and fair in his reporting of what was said and the possible implications for Irish foreign policy and neutrality.  That ended around the late 1990s and since then I have noticed - I have done a lot of empirical analysis of this - that the journalists who are reporting at EU level are more like embedded journalists.  They are no longer independently reporting.  They are in a way rewriting what was said, not critiquing it or looking at it from the perspective of traditional Irish foreign policy norms.  I cannot tell my students that if they want to know about Irish foreign policy or the European Union, they should consult <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, etc.  I have to provide the documentary evidence.  Even with textbooks on the EU, which I am always asked to review, I find I am always critiquing them because they give this depoliticised flowery picture of how EU politics works.  I prefer to use the textbooks to teach how the institutions work but I provide my own analysis of both sides of the argument as to when the EU does good and when it has room for improvement, and I leave my students to make up their own minds on it.  I give material from both sides, and that has been absent from academia.<br\/><br\/>Even Professor Giandomenico Majone, the European University Institute, EUI, pro-European Union academic I mentioned, when outlining the three operating strategies and principles of how the EU works, stated that academics have never critiqued these and they do not want to do so because they are all inherently pro-European Union.  If one is studying the EU, one is pro-European Union.  Such academics do not want to touch it because they are afraid that if they do, they are somehow undermining the European Union project.  That is a problem, even if one is, as I have always been, pro-EU.  It was why I started studying it myself.  I did a masters in European integration in Limerick and I continued to study it; I teach it in DCU.  I have been teaching it for over ten years at DCU, and prior to that in Trinity and in Aberdeen.  The point is that one cannot suspend one's critical faculties.  Deputy Crowe is correct in that regard.<br\/><br\/>One cannot really criticise the EU in relation to Iraq.  It did not come up with a position because it was split along the traditional axis of CSDP, the UK versus France.  France was very much against the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan by the US, seeing them as basically imperialist interventions.  The UK decided the special relationship was more important and became part of the coalition of the willing.  Deputy Crowe is correct when he cites the 100,000 who marched in Dublin in the anti-war demonstrations.  In fact, I included that in the bigger paper that I will submit to the committee.  There was not much leadership there.  Just like the media, that is completely absent from Irish politics in the past 20 or 30 years.  I point to some of those changes in the wider paper.<br\/><br\/>The third comment Deputy Crowe made was that Ireland has not used the veto and he asked why that is the case.  I go back to the point I made to the Chairman on this notion of elite socialisation - the idea that Ireland was so eager to join the EEC.  The first application was submitted in 1961, de Gaulle vetoed the UK's entry and Ireland did not pursue it.  We submitted another two applications - three applications in all - and the third and final one was accepted.  However, we were willing to sell ourselves, effectively sell out, just to get in.  Partly, this was because of the organisation of domestic politics in Ireland in that one can see that the fishermen were not a strong lobby group and fishing was literally handed over to the EU, yet we did not give our land and our farming, which are really important to this island, over to the EU in that respect.  We do not control agricultural policy; it is controlled at the EU level, with Ireland having a seat at that table.  There were so many aspects, including our foreign policy aspects, that we were willing to set aside in order to join.<br\/><br\/>I can understand why, given that Ireland wanted to develop and was overly dependent on the UK.  My problem is that we do not use the veto because our thinking has gone too far, and this is why I included elements of the Taoiseach's speech.  In terms of our political elite, we are now so embedded in being good Europeans and on the side of the 27 that we have fundamentally lost what we are supposed to do and what other EU states, such as Denmark, do in terms of simply fighting for one's interests.  When I teach students how the EU works, I explain that they should forget about the tabloid headlines one might get, in particular, in the UK, such as &quot;Brussels is trying to control us&quot;, and learn that every piece of legislation passed by the EU has been passed with the support of member state governments because that is how decisions are taken.  Every piece of legislation, whether it is a decision, a directive or a regulation, has to be passed by the Council of Ministers.  The problem, for me, is that the EU, as it has developed, has given more power to the European Parliament but in tandem has also increased the involvement of qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers, which means that smaller member states can be outvoted or a coalition of member states can be outvoted on an important proposal.  In a way, this is a problem of the democratic deficit in the EU that Deputy Crowe talked about.  The notion of EU federalisation that the Deputy mentioned  is, in fact, what is driving that - the European Parliament is a direct representative of the citizens of the EU and it should have co-decision standing with the Council of Ministers.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy stated that polls have shown that people oppose the democratic deficit and that trust in the EU has shrunk.  One of the points I make in the wider paper is that when one looks at states such as Greece and Ireland that have, in a way, been hammered by the policies of the EU in relation to bailouts and resisting the vested interests that the then US Treasury Secretary, Mr. Timothy Geithner, was representing when he was trying to influence the EU decisions on what to do about, for example, the Irish banks or Greek sovereign debt, one can see the problem.  In terms of the analysis of opinion polls - I have written a paper on this - trust and identification with Europe has completely plummeted among those member states' populations, the so-called PIIGS.  This is in direct contrast to the member states which have emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis although the banks of France, Germany and the UK were just as reckless as Irish banks or Greek banks because the whole system is interconnected.  I did not present it today, but I am using the analogy of how Ireland acquiesced to the vested interests in the output of the negotiations in 2010 over the imposition of the bailout whereas the leaders previously, from 1916 or even prior to that, would never have allowed that to happen because they had enough notion of Irish national interest to resist it.<\/p><p>A state such as Denmark which is used to using its veto and sees no problem in using it, that does not have this post-colonial mentality of having to please all the time, would not have let a similar situation happen.  I have a lot of sympathy for what the member said about that.<\/p><p> On whether the EU institutions learned anything from Brexit, I wrote a draft paper on this which analyses the debate in the European Parliament immediately after the result of the referendum on 26 June 2016, when 52% of voters in the UK voted to leave the EU.  Those European Parliament discourses were completely divided and in a worrying way.  On the left, most MEPs said they could understand the result if one looked at the imposition of austerity that had been part of the EU's response to the global financial crisis.  That is why I looked at the Eurobarometer polls in the so-called PIIGS states to see the effect on trust in the EU and identification with the European Union project.  It has had such a detrimental effect.  The MEPs said that Brexit was just another symptom of that, and they said that, as parliamentarians and part of the overall EU body, they had failed people in that respect and they should have done better.  They said that this should be a wake up call for them, that they did not want another country to exit because of the EU's difficulties in handling these issues.<\/p><p> The other side of the debate worried me.  This was the ideological problem I had, namely, the EU-vangelist, as one might call it, where there was absolutely no acceptance of the notion that 17 million people had said that they wanted to get out, that they felt it was not in their interests.  There was no notion that maybe the EU had not done so well in the global financial crisis and the imposition of austerity, that maybe it could have done something different.  There was no critical engagement whatsoever with the reasons people voted for Brexit.  Instead, what they said was that it was an opportunity to go forward with further integration, to have a banking union and a fiscal union.  Germany's Finance Minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, called for a European system of welfare, and he called for this before.  They want to be able to concentrate power and put in more integration in policy areas where the EU is not currently involved.  They want to keep pushing that.  It speaks to Professor Majone's observation that the end result of European integration is not the point, so much as its need to keep getting more competences.  That side of the MEPs debate was very worrying.  If the EU continues to be blind to its flaws and refuses to engage out of fear - nobody likes to be criticised or attacked - it is that lack of critical engagement with self that I find particularly worrying.<\/p><p> On whether the EU institutions have learned anything from Brexit, half the Parliament has and half has not and its solution is to go further down the federalisation project route, which many member state populations would not agree with.  I do not think it is the correct response.<\/p><p> There was a worry that when the British voice is gone, there will be an urge to go down the federal route and the question was asked as to whether there would be an acceleration of EU militarisation and would we, in Ireland, give up public statements on neutrality or would we no longer continue the pretence of neutrality.  I wrote a paper looking at how Sweden and Ireland have behaved in engaging with EU military operations and it is worth noting the contrast.  Sweden has gone for EU security and defence and full involvement in military operations.  This is partly why it got involved in Libya, where Swedish jets engaged in airstrikes.  Swedish fighter jets were involved in the conflict.  The Swedish discourses were very much what the Irish Government would like to say but is not saying and has not said.  Sweden said that it was part of its foreign policy identity and is what the country is about and it was doing good by intervening in this manner.<\/p><p> Sweden is a signal of where Ireland may go.  The Irish Government still feels somewhat constrained by Irish public opinion, mainly because there have been so many referendums and because of the constitutional requirement arising from the Crotty case that there has to be a referendum on any new treaty that proposes further transfer of sovereignty from Ireland to the EU.  I do not know if the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, will be the one to say it but the road we are going down is where we will simply give up public statements on neutrality.  Sweden, Finland and Austria have.  They no longer use the word neutrality to define their foreign policy, they use \"non-allied\".  Ireland is similar in that it says that it is not about neutrality, it is always about military neutrality and that is defined as whatever the Government wants it to be on a given day.  It is not embedded in international customary law such as The Hague Conventions of 1907 where one will find what a state has to be to be neutral in any future conflict.  We will see an acceleration of EU militarisation with the UK gone.  That is one of the dynamics that we need to understand.  For those who want to defend the traditional norms of Irish foreign policy, Ireland does not want to get dragged into a big state-driven EU operation.<\/p><p> On whether the UK will prioritise relations with the US rather than the EU and how that might affect Irish foreign policy, it depends on who is in government.  Tony Blair was one of the key individuals who, in a way, signals the demise of the diametrically opposed partnership between the UK and Ireland in trying to restrict further federalisation in the area of security and defence.  He changed his mind after a meeting with Jacques Chirac in St. Malo in 1998, when they came out with this idea of a European security and defence identity.  This was a huge change in UK foreign policy which had previously been against it.  In her Brexit speech of 17 January this year, Theresa May said that the UK would still co-operate with the EU in foreign policy but the UK, outside the EU, is going to have a huge effect on Irish foreign policy.<\/p><p> We are suddenly going to become completely alone at the European Council table.  The other neutrals have divested themselves of neutrality and are taking a more active part in military and training operations.  They are more NATO-aligned than Ireland is officially.  With the UK gone, Ireland will have to stand on its own feet without a bigger state reflecting its position, albeit for completely diametrically opposed reasons.  That is probably the biggest thing that I have to say here.  We have never used our veto.  The Government does not particularly care about trying to hang on to those normative aspects of Irish foreign policy and the values associated with neutrality.  The question is whether public opinion will put enough pressure on Government to try to retain those aspects of neutrality.  I wrote my PhD thesis on public opinion on Irish neutrality while I was at Trinity College.  Depending on the how the question is put, between two in three or four in five people in Ireland support neutrality and they do not want it changed.  When they are asked if they would be willing to cede aspects of it in favour of an EU common security and defence policy they say they do not favour that.  When one looks at opinion poll data for the reasons behind the rejection of the Nice treaty and the Lisbon treaty, the biggest substantive policy reason, other than that people did not know the contents of the treaty, was because they wanted to strengthen Irish neutrality.  That is the dilemma that we will face.<\/p><p> The North and Brexit was raised and whether a special status for the North should be a priority for Ireland in the negotiations, and how that will pan out.  There is a type of hybrid concept that could apply to the North.  This is part of Tony Blair's discourses who wants to roll back the referendum result and does not want the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  The notion that a majority of people in Scotland and a majority of people in Northern Ireland did not vote for Brexit and that it was people in Wales and England who voted for Scotland has to be set aside because it is divisive.  The UK is a union and I do not believe it will break up any time soon.  There is talk of Scotland having another referendum on independence but Theresa May has ruled that out.  The idea of a special status for the North should be one of the core priorities for Ireland.  It is ironic that Theresa May made more references to Ireland in her Brexit speech of 17 January this year than the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, did in his speech on 15 February this year.  She explicitly stated that the UK has a long history with Ireland.  She used the phrase \"a special relationship\" and said that the UK has to be careful to prioritise that in negotiations.<\/p><p> At the same time, we must look at Northern Ireland, the fact that there is an open Border and that Ireland, as an island, contains two separate states.  In terms of European integration, with the UK being a member of the EU the hope was that relations between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland would improve and that economic integration would help lessen some of the tensions underlying the conflict.  Money was put forward in terms of INTERREG programmes.  The EU put forward small amounts of money to help with the peace process.  It should be a priority for the Irish Government, as it is for the UK Government, to ensure that Northern Ireland is treated as a special case and that its needs will be fulfilled in the Brexit negotiations.  However, my fear, and I refer to the comment by the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, that we are on the EU side of the table and are one of the 27, is that it will be forgotten.  We have to come at this from the national interest.  It is the job of Ministers in the EU Council of Ministers and leaders of states in the European Council to defend their interests.  I hope that will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Devine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":848,"content":"<p>We are out of time.

I apologise for any offence caused but I was making a political point by way of analogy to<i>Animal Farm<\/i>.  Senator Daly asked about derogations and supplying the Chair of the committee with a legal analysis.  I wrote an article for Cooperation and Conflict in 2011 in which I analysed the published legal views of academics at that time who had written about the legality of European security and defence.  On derogations, they referred to the &quot;Irish clause&quot; which stated that nothing in the mutual defence clause would affect the character of the security and defence policy of certain member states.  The clause went on to make an analogy with members of the EU who were also part of NATO.  It was the UK who pushed for this because it safeguarded the UK's prioritisation of NATO's article 5 guarantee in the Washington treaty over the new article 5 mutual defence clause in the treaty of the European Union.  Ireland has no derogations nor opt-outs and the legal opinion of the academics whom I quoted in the paper, which I will also supply to the committee, was that if the clause was supposed to be a derogation for neutrality it should have stated it.  It did not do so, however, so in their opinion it has no legal effect.<br\/><br\/>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked about the idea of neutrality being the emperor's new clothes, with trade being the focus in the form of CETA and the now-shelved TTIP.  He also asked about the trading of munitions and arms.  I do think neutrality is the emperor's clothes but this is an analogy and it signifies the double reading that is being done at EU level, which also involves the Irish elites and decision makers.  Closed-door decision making at the EU means the issue is somewhat opaque.  The EU has responded to efforts to publish some of the details of the negotiations over TTIP but it is right to say that, ultimately, we need to focus attention on massive trading agreements between blocs and large nations.  I was e-mailed by activists before the news on TTIP broke and I wanted to have time to look at it but unfortunately have not had that time.  The focus needs to be on critical engagement with these issues.<br\/><br\/>The final question was on independent thinking in academia and the issue of reflecting what is going on in the media, leading to the failure of critical engagement.  The fact that European academic funding is channelled through the EU is a factor and some academics have referred to other academics who are driven by the need to obtain EU funding, calling them &quot;jobbing academics&quot;.  Academics are supposed to be critical, independent and engaged individuals who are not strictly politicised, in the sense of being pro-EU or anti-EU.  Some academics in UK universities, on hearing the result of the referendum, asked, &quot;What about our EU funding?&quot;  A lot of universities campaigned against Brexit because of EU research funding.  Tenure, promotion and careers are dependent on securing funding and the EU is the only source for funding so there is a critical lack of engagement in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Karen Devine"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":867,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Devine.

This committee, Parliament and the Government have to be very strong within the 27 member states negotiating with Britain to advocate our interests and it is in our interests that Britain gets the best possible deal with the EU because of our historical trading relationships and interdependence.  There is a huge amount of bilateral contact.  This committee met the First Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr. Frans Timmermans.  We outlined our concerns about Brexit and how it would affect all of our island and we told Mr. Timmermans what we needed the EU to address in the negotiations.  We met with the House of Commons select committee on exiting the European Union, chaired by Hilary Benn, MP, and our colleagues from the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs have held various meetings in Brussels.  There is a huge amount of bilateral contact at Oireachtas and Government level to outline Ireland's concerns and where we want the negotiations to end up.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Devine quite rightly referred to the lack of confidence in the EU following the failure to support small countries when the global economic crash happened.  When there was a threat to some of the major economies the European Central Bank put in quantitative easing, which would have made a huge difference if it was activated a few years earlier.  There has been a lack of governance and Germany and France have exercised dominance for several years, such as by calling summit meetings.  Comments made by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel and French President, Nicholas Sarkozy, were very unhelpful to Ireland when we faced particular economic challenges.  Despite these things, the most recent eurobarometer poll showed that 67% of the Irish people believe we are better within the European Union than outside.  Ireland is still positive about Europe, though that does not mean we should not be critical because we have good reason to be critical over what did not happen for a few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#L00600","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1489050000,"counter":870,"content":"<p>The joint committee went into private session at 10.50 a.m. and resumed in public session at 11.15 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Implications of Brexit for Irish Exports: Irish Exporters Association","time":1489050000,"counter":871,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#O00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":872,"content":"<p>In session B we are meeting representatives of the Irish Exporters Association as part of the remit of the committee is trade promotion.

We wish to make a number of key points about the likely impact of Brexit on our members and how the country should prepare.  While we can influence the final outcome of the negotiations with the European Union, nonetheless they are ultimately outside our control.  However, there are matters within our control which require action now.<\/p> <p>  We must put in place new shipping and air links with continental Europe and the rest of the world.  We must become more cost competitive.  We wish to lobby strongly for food and agricultural products and livestock to be high on the European Union's customs free trade agenda.  This is in the United Kingdom's interests, as well as ours.  We want to ensure companies will consider their entire supply chain and the impact of a UK exit on all of their input costs and start thinking about alternatives.  We wish to recognise and attract more foreign direct investment from the United Kingdom and elsewhere for those who wish to retain access to the European Union.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Exporters Association, IEA, has been running a series of surveys with members to quantify what they believe are the biggest threats to the economy.  Some 81% are concerned about Brexit, 63% are concerned about Donald Trump, 59% are concerned about Ireland's cost competitiveness, 47% are concerned about affordable housing, 46% are concerned about elections in Holland, France and Germany, 32% are concerned about the availability of skilled talent, while 7% are concerned about other matters.  A total of 94% of IEA members do business with or export to the United Kingdom and 39% of members say more than 25% of their total exports are destined for there.  Some 58% are planning to diversify their export markets, up from 54% last year, while 71% said the weakening of sterling had had an impact on their business, up considerably from 65% last year.<\/p> <p>  On transport links, our members are telling us that we must start looking for alternative physical routes to avoid the use of the UK land bridge and the additional costs that will likely arise if a border is put in place.  A significant share of Irish exports are shipped through the UK land bridge, as this is the quickest route to continental Europe.  Depending on the terms of the future trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union, Brexit has the capacity to seriously threaten the reliability of this transit route.  The agrifood and fisheries sector depends on fast access to markets and intercontinental air hubs.  Alternative routes to continental Europe will have to be researched and funded, including upgrading Irish ports.  In 2006 Maersk Line introduced a new feeder loop for Irish cargo that linked with Algeciras rather than English Channel or Benelux ports.  This saves up to ten days on some routes.  Opening new routes could open opportunities for Irish exporters.  There are also air freight alternatives.  For example, in 2017 the arrival of the IAG Group's major shareholder, Qatar Airways, in Dublin further increases the air freight options for exports to Asian and African markets.  More services to and from Irish airports increase the cargo possibilities for Irish trade.  We must start work on this now to ensure we will have a route to market and our ports, airports and access to transport will allow us to avoid the United Kingdom without undue delay.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of cost competitiveness, there is a direct correlation between movement in the euro-sterling exchange rate and the value of goods exported to the United Kingdom.  Irish exports to the United Kingdom peak during times of euro weakness.  There is also a direct correlation between cost competitiveness and the size of our export market.  As we lose competitiveness we run the risk that our exports will become too expensive.  If there are tariffs on Irish goods sold in the United Kingdom and we also have to face into the head wind of a VAT-type border tax being introduced in the United States, our two biggest trading markets for our indigenous and FDI companies, the United Kingdom and the United States, will both face huge challenges.  <\/p> <p>  The other costs of doing business in Ireland are continuing to rise.  Costs such as labour, insurance, energy, raw materials and rent are all increasing.  The increasing costs will impact on our ability to do business and, in some instances, may result in companies going out of business, particularly where margins are low.  This is reflected in the feedback we have received from our members in our recent survey.  They are concerned about their ability to absorb these higher costs.  We recommend a greater focus on reducing our rising cost base driven by wages, personal taxes, currency movements, tariffs and other costs across industry sectors.<\/p> <p>  Irish exports of food and agricultural products reached record levels in 2016, according to the Central Statistics Office, despite a drop in shipments to Britain.  Export values rose by 4% to nearly &euro;117 billion last year, with most sectors enjoying growth in this period.  It was the highest annual export value on record.<\/p><p>Exports to the UK increased by 4% while imports from the UK decreased by 8%.  At the same time in 2016, the UK incurred its second highest trade surplus of $5.3 billion with Ireland.  Consequently, although we may only be fifth in terms of our importance to the UK, we are strongly contributing to its overall trade balance, which increases our importance to the UK market.  CSO data show some sectors are heavily dependent on the British market with a number of sectors particularly vulnerable.  Britain is not self-sufficient in food and we traditionally make up the balance in beef, dairy and consumer foods.  This relationship is somewhat symbiotic, in that Ireland is also the UK's largest destination for food exports worth &euro;3.8 billion in 2015.<\/p><p> The food and agriculture policy that the UK will adopt outside of the EU will determine a lot for Irish agrifood exports.  If the UK goes down the road of a \"cheap food\" policy as it did before it joined the EU 40 years ago, it will have serious implications for the food and agricultural industry in Ireland.  There is no doubt the UK is already being approached by non-EU countries eager to do business with it.  However, depending on faraway markets to provide food to the UK poses significant risks to the UK as other countries may outbid it in their own desire for food security.  The UK could potentially source lesser quality food outside the EU at cheaper rates.  In saying that, there are still standards in supermarkets that would need to be maintained.  Ireland needs to be thinking five to seven years down the line to remain competitive.<\/p><p> To combat a hard Brexit, many of our members have said that they would be considering sourcing more of their supply needs from the UK, locating more staff in the UK and shifting some production to the UK.  This will have serious implications for employment in Ireland, especially low-skilled labour and rural areas dependent on manufacturing.  Initially, our members were mainly concerned with the impact of currency fluctuations, which were immediate following the referendum.  There has been a definite shift in concern from implications of currency to a serious concern about the reintroduction of customs.  Indigenous Irish businesses are woefully unprepared in this regard.  Even from an administrative perspective, if a company has only ever exported to the UK, it has never had to deal with customs procedures previously.  Realistically speaking, training and upskilling staff should start now, as opposed to waiting until the chaos of implementation.  There seems to be a generally held view that it will take the UK years to negotiate the 53 separate trade agreements that it currently accesses as part of the EU.  Our understanding is that it will not be as difficult or as drawn out as is expected and that it will be accomplished quite quickly, especially with countries in the Commonwealth.  Countries outside the EU, especially the US, China and the UAE, will not benefit from extended trade negotiations and will not want to interrupt a bilateral trade relationship in which they have invested heavily.  This will benefit the UK and will likely come at the expense of Ireland.  We do not know the outcome of EU negotiations with the UK but we can make an educated guess that it is likely to be closer to the Turkish model of a partial customs-free union than the Swiss model, which requires contributions to the EU budget.  There is also a possibility that in addition, the UK may look for import and export quotas, perhaps frozen at current levels, without tariffs.  <\/p><p> We should also consider the possibility of having minimum immigration levels set between the UK and Ireland-Europe, particularly when it comes to attracting skilled labour and talent which are not available in Ireland.  This could form part of an overall agreement between the UK and the EU along the lines of the Scottish Government's suggestions for the movement of people.  We consider that more focus needs to be put on trade between Ireland and the UK.  We should not simply focus on the impact of a border with Northern Ireland.  <\/p><p> We will also face pressure from the US in the form of tax reforms to attract US multinationals back to the US in terms of future investment decisions, as well as pressure from Europe to share our corporate tax with the rest of Europe.  Many of the financial institutions or insurance companies in the UK that are considering setting up operations outside the UK are concerned about having a high Irish cost base combined with a regulatory regime that is considered overly strict in comparison with some of our European counterparts.  I note that AIG moved its jobs to Luxembourg yesterday.  We are unlikely to gain a significant number of new jobs from the UK in any event from any new offices set up in Ireland in the financial services industry.  An expansion of the SARP tax relief, a reduction in high personal tax rates and the introduction of some form of immigration quotas with the UK would all be of assistance, as well as considering how to reduce the level of red tape involved in establishing such businesses in Ireland without a lessening of standards.  We consider a new focus needs to be placed by the IDA on attracting FDI from the Middle East, China and India, which are looking for opportunities within Europe, particularly for locations outside of Dublin with good transport links to the airports and ports.  <\/p><p> Our recommendations here today are that the Government should identify the UK landbridge as a serious risk to trade and research and invest in alternative, but equally reliable, transit routes.  It should focus negotiations more on the east-west trade relationship, research the implications for Ireland if the UK implements a \"cheap food\" policy and prepare for the impact on SMEs of the reintroduction of customs procedures, including through the upskilling of staff to deal with potential changes.  In addition, it should refocus on our cost competitiveness and the costs of doing business in Ireland and look to attract FDI from the UK and elsewhere for those who want to retain access to Europe but to do this we need to look at our cost base.  Moreover, it should ensure companies consider their entire supply chain and the impact of a UK exit on all their input costs and start thinking about alternatives and should lobby strongly for food and agricultural products to be high on the EU agenda for free trade, which is in the UK's interest as well as our interest.  While Ireland has become less dependent on the UK through increased diversification of its export markets in the past 40 years, the UK is still a very significant trading partner.  We have traded with the UK for more than 1,000 years.  We will continue to do so but now that trade is going to be different.  We thank the committee for the opportunity to present here today and will take any questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Byrne for her presentation.  There is a lot of very good material in it regarding the many issues that must be dealt with in advance of and following Brexit.  I am very glad that she highlighted the need for us to develop more transport links with northern Europe and elsewhere because ferry services and cargo services from this country are quite limited.  We do not seem to have a value on the amount of exports that leave our country and transit through Great Britain to other destinations, including those within the EU.  They leave our island, enter Great Britain, enter another EU destination and then exit the EU to go to another destination.  How many checks and control systems will such products have to go through?  This must be a worry.  I have failed to get figures regarding what level of exports leave our country and transit through Great Britain.  It is a huge issue for us and I am very glad Ms Byrne highlighted it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to food exports and the adoption of a \"cheap food\" policy of Great Britain, we were the victims of that policy for many years when we had no other market for agricultural products.  The EU will quite rightly not agree to dumbing down food standards.  The first people who would literally be up in arms against that would be the primary producers - the farmers.  The farmers and the State have invested hugely in us having a very sophisticated primary agriculture production system and processing system in which we achieve very high standards.  We export food and drink to something like 180 countries because of the very high standards within our food industry.  Great Britain is not a large food exporter because it is a large food importer.  However, I believe it exported something like &pound;9.9 billion worth of food to the EU in 2016, which represented about 71% of its food and drink exports.  It will still want the EU as a market for those products so I presume there is a very good case to be made for not accepting the dumbing down of food standards, which would suit us.  <\/p> <p>  Of the groups that have engaged with us, the association is the first group that has highlighted problems relating to relocation.  I can see this affecting the food industry and some other traditional manufacturing enterprises.  This must be a very serious worry.

The purpose of these hearings by various Oireachtas committees is to find solutions.  The Irish Exporters Association has called on the Government to engage in various ways.  We hope the delegates will supply us with detailed proposals that the committee can put to the Government on measures that could be taken.  For example, as the Chairman asked, what should our proposal be to the European Union on transit routes across Britain?  Should we propose the use of steel containers?  Would there be a precedent for this?  We have to make an argument for all of these.  How would it work?  What can we do?<\/p> <p>  Is there an argument to be made on trade quotas?  What we need are detailed ideas of what our trade quotas with Britain should be.  In the 1960s we had a trade agreement with Britain on agriculture which was not entirely favourable to us, but, as the Chairman pointed out, it was our only market and we had no choice.  What should be our trade quotas at present day values?  We need to state we are a special case in the European Union because this will decimate our agricultural community if we do not have trade quotas between Ireland and Britain.  It would also be in Britain's interests because it has a trade surplus.  Ms Byrne could not give us in her statement because we simply did not have the time the nuts and bolts of how much we should seek in every sector.  In agriculture, manufacturing, clothing and other sectors we should state the trade quota Ireland is seeking.  We need to go to the European Union with these details which the Irish Exporters Association have.  I am sure the Department also has them.  When we go to the European Union, people tell us they are looking for our proposals.<\/p> <p>  There is an interesting precedent for trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic in what happened between East Germany and West Germany prior to the Berlin Wall coming down.  During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s East Germany was allowed to trade with West Germany without having to comply with European Community law.  I do not know whether a blind eye was turned to this trade, but we need details because it would allow us to tell the Germans that they had an arrangement between East Germany and West Germany and that we should be allowed to have one between the North and the South because we are a special case.  The phrase \"special case\" was used when the German trade law was described.  Will the Irish Exporters Association provide the committee with more details on what it wants?  Unless we go to the European Union with what we want, it will be assumed that we do not want anything.  Preferably we need to have it backed up by precedent and existing European regulations and laws, whereby, for example, we can state Ireland is seeking something under a particular directive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#Q00100","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":877,"content":"<p>We all agree that Irish jobs should not be lost because of a decision made primarily by English and Welsh voters.

Do the delegates have any idea for what percentage it accounts?  Ms Byrne stated more preparations needed to be made.  Will she expand on this point?

What more do we need to do as a state?<\/p> <p>  The idea of connectivity with the rest of Europe includes energy.  Our access to energy markets is through Britain.

Does the Irish Exporters Association have a view on a special relaxation of the fiscal rules for Ireland because of our unique position?  Has it discussed this issue?  Ms Byrne spoke about competitiveness.  Unfortunately, everyone runs off and states labour costs represent the biggest competitiveness issue.  It is not necessarily the case for Irish business that labour represents the biggest cost.  Some of it has to do with upward-only rent reviews and child care and other costs, including the cost of rent and accommodation for workers.  Do the delegates agree that if the 12.5% corporation tax rate was implemented in full for every company, it would grow the tax base and allow us to reduce personal tax rates?  I have huge sympathy and concern for SMEs which provide jobs throughout the State as they are not afforded sweetheart tax deals.<\/p> <p>  I understand and sympathise with Ms Byrne's statement that we need more of a focus on trade between Ireland and Britain, not simply a focus on the North and the imposition of a border because east-west trade is extremely important.  Ms Byrne mentioned the importance of food and agricultural exports, a matter about which the Chairman also spoke.  Does the Irish Exporters Association believe there is a demand for quality food in Britain?  Ms Byrne spoke about customer surveys.  People state they want quality food and that it is not just about how it is presented but what goes into it.  They are concerned about genetically modified foods and additives.  Most people who eat meat would not necessarily want to find antibiotics in their food stock.  How important is this issue?  Are we raising a particular fear that might not necessarily reflect people's eating habits?  There is a huge demand for fast food, as we can see in our communities.  People do not have a clue how to cook and there is an over-reliance on convenience foods, something about which I am concerned.  Many Irish food products do not go down the fast food route, which might be a benefit.  Is the Irish Exporters Association concerned about the idea of products coming in through Britain and the North and being dumped here?<\/p> <p>  Ms Byrne mentioned the importance of food and agricultural products.  A border would be devastating for the milk industry.

I can answer the rest then.  Ms Armstrong will begin because we have surveyed the number of our members who have crossed the land bridge.  We have approximately 600 members from FDI down.  We focused on agriculture as part of our exports, but I qualify that by noting that agriculture represents only 2% of total exports.  I record that 66% of our exports are from large, foreign-owned FDI companies, 21% from medium foreign-owned FDI companies, and 1% from small FDI companies.  The balance of Irish-owned businesses comprises 4% large Irish owned, 6% medium Irish owned and only 2% Irish owned small business.  As such, talking about FDI in total matters because every success to date has been to attract that FDI which caused our exports to be where they are.  We have been a rip-roaring success in attracting the right business into this country.  No matter which Government has been in place, they have all worked toward bringing that to bear on the market.  I wanted to qualify that because while agriculture is hugely important in terms of jobs, regional balance and the North-South issue, one must focus on the fact that 66% of our exports come from large FDI companies.  It is not about the beef, it is about moving all of that.<\/p> <p>  Most of those companies are now moving into high-end services.  Medical can walk out with &euro;2 billion worth of equipment in a suitcase and deliver it to the UK for high-end medical products.  This is not all about shipping.  We are shipping food and stock, but we have to focus on bringing in the jobs that keep those exports going.  We have been very successful in doing that.  What we are trying to do now in the Irish Exporters' Association is protect Irish jobs and our members so that everybody continues to export to the UK.  This is a crisis.  We are spending a great deal of time on the political agenda North-South.  While it is ultimately important, what is funding that is trade.  If we do not keep this trade rocking, there will be nothing to fund up North or South.  Trade is everything.  We need that trade to flow freely.  The reason the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is very important to us is that we need it to do more of what it does best, namely, build those relationships so that we can keep the trade we have now and develop the future trade we hope to win.  At that, I will let Ms Armstrong provide the figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489050000,"counter":882,"content":"<p>The first question was about trying to get some statistics behind the use of the land bridge.  A survey of our members, which will be published during the week, shows that 67% use the UK land bridge to access the continental market.  It is a hugely significant number.  Those members are very concerned about continuing to use the UK in terms of customs and being stopped at borders.  They are very concerned that the slow direct route will impact the quality of the product.  It is 40% of our members who are worried about that.  Over half think it will impact on their overall costs of inventory and other costs.  They are very concerned and are actively looking at opening up other routes, namely, new shipping routes.  They are looking at which ports have the easiest access to Europe.  That is obviously to look at Rosslare and the deep-sea water port in Foynes.  Should we be investing in the latter?  That is what our members are looking at and they are in discussions with Maersk and other companies to see what they can do.

If that happens, the three ports with tier 1 status will have to be looked again by the EU.  If the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wants to do something, it should talk to the Department with responsibility for the marine to discuss what point is on the shortest route if we cannot cross the UK.  That is most likely Rosslare or somewhere in that neck of the woods.  We cannot come from Foynes, around the bottom of the country and then across the channel to get to the Continent; we will have to go direct.  That may mean looking at the status of our three ports.

I was present when the memorandum of understanding was signed between London and Dublin.  The British and Irish Governments got together on shipping energy across the water.  Energy is not as great a risk for us but while connectivity heading to France is always an option, it is something we should be concerned about.  The cost problem for our members in Ireland is due to the focus on green energy.  We have looked to head green and the cost of that has been carried by all business but I do not believe they have that correct when it comes to energy.<\/p> <p>  Internal energy issues for our members who want to trade out of the country are a real concern.  Because green energy has taken such a priority, we are funding something that has not been well thought out.  The ESB and the Government need to get together to address that issue because we will not be competitive.  Every survey the IDA and Enterprise Ireland run compares us with western Europe in terms of Switzerland, France and Germany.  They take the highest value markets to compare us with.  Unfortunately, when we lose our connectivity to the UK, we will be competing with Poland and Romania where the cost of living and the cost of doing business are substantially lower.<\/p> <p>  It looks great to say we are doing well because we have compared ourselves with high value countries, but when we compare ourselves with where the competition is going to come from, it is not going to work out.  We have not been looking at the full picture.  We have deliberately focused our gaze to make ourselves look good.  Having said that, we have the best productivity in the world.  Our GNP and Irish productivity show that if one spends $1 in Ireland, one will get 50% more productivity than anywhere else in the world.

We are going out asking for special dispensations about Northern Ireland, yet nobody seems to understand the precariousness of Northern Ireland.  They have all got their own competitive markets to fight for.  The Romanian ambassador is keen to point out to me on a regular basis that Ireland does incredibly well and nobody understands why.  It is because we were between the two giant markets of the US and the UK, and we have done particularly well because we all spoke a common language.<\/p> <p>  While we cannot dictate the fiscal rules, we have to get much louder in what we are fighting for.

It was also very clearly expressed that Scotland may emerge as an issue in the next couple of weeks.  Some of the members who were at the meeting were very clear that there is likely to be a push for a vote in Scotland.  I do not know how that is going to change the whole mix of negotiations on Brexit but I imagine it will change it.

Ignoring the food and the pharmaceutical sectors, we are left with services and that is our strength, so we should aim to build relationships through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to attract people into the country who develop an affinity with the country and promote trade. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017030900002#T00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489050000,"counter":901,"content":"<p>One of the points made in the paper published yesterday was about trying to attract more foreign students into Ireland, which is a good idea.

That is a good idea but it means we need to invest in our universities.

It is probably one of the most relevant points.  We are completely dependent on foreign-owned exporting businesses in Ireland.  We need to focus on our tech services and on all the exports where goods are not traditionally shipped over land.  We need to focus on the non-physical stuff that is just as important for export.  Education also comes under that bracket.  In order to create more indigenous industries we have to stop thinking about tangible products moving across land or sea, we need to start talking about broadband infrastructure and we have to start skilling up in those areas.  It will become more specific as we take in more talent.<\/p> <p>  On my way in today I was thinking the one attribute Ireland has - most people think it is a failing - is that we are nimble and open to change.  We have always been open to change.  It is really important for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to see that we can be really nimble and adapt our exports.  To date we have followed a traditional route, but we are a different Ireland.  It is a different Europe now and we have the ability to say to the rest of the world, \"We are nimble.  We are open.

Ms Byrne mentioned AIG; although financial services and the IFSC are very important none of the clients we deal with said they would take 1,000 jobs from London and bring them here.  That will not happen; they will bring a smaller number of jobs.  When it comes to bringing a larger number of jobs, we are always asked outside the corporate tax rate, which is absolutely a pillar, what the personal tax rate is.  Many companies have what they call tax equalisation policies.  They start by looking at their home country to establish how much an employee would earn after tax in that country and calculate how much they need to pay that person in Ireland in order to ensure it is the same.<\/p> <p>  We have done some things, for example, SARP, the special assignee relief programme, which affords tax relief to companies bringing foreign nationals to work in the country.  We have also done some things to reciprocate regarding expanding the number of countries for which there is a foreign earnings deduction if they go abroad.  However, we are just not competitive enough, particularly in the entrepreneurial space.  I constantly meet people in start-up Irish companies that get bought out by US or other foreign companies.  Unfortunately that happens in the very early stage.  One of the reasons is that people are trying to decide whether to stay on or sell on and make the money now.  Unfortunately that is often driven by their after-tax return on the investment.  The UK has improved its entrepreneurship tax regime and has become more competitive.  I have met a number of entrepreneurs who have considered setting up a company in the UK because they will do better after tax.  We have not done enough.<\/p> <p>  We have done some things on farm consolidation which is very important.  In order for the agrifood industry to survive we need to upskill and change the type and quality of products.  We were talking about Kobe beef and other such high-end premium products that our farmers can produce.  Farm consolidation, more efficient farms, the use of technology in agriculture and the tax reliefs around that are definitely helping the agricultural industry.  We can always do more and at the very least we need to compete on an international stage.  That is under serious threat with the common consolidated tax base, with the EU being unhappy with how the taxes are shared among us.

That is a significant number of destinations throughout the world.  It is a big imprint.<\/p> <p>  There was reference to infant formula.  As a very small country we contributed approximately 15% of the world's baby formula in 2010.  That is phenomenal for a small state.  I do not know if the percentage has remained the same.

We spoke earlier about the deficiencies in the European Union, as it is now, but it has been hugely successful in that core policy objective which arose out of rationing of food in Europe following the Second World War.

These proposals tackle the remaining weaknesses and implement some outstanding elements that are essential to ensure the institutions' resilience.  These risk reduction measures will not only further strengthen the resilience of the European banking system and increase market confidence, but will also allow further progress in completing the banking union.<br\/><br\/>The Commission is proposing amendments to two key pieces of legislation: the , which provide for the single rule book that applies across the Union regarding prudential requirements for institutions and rules on governance and supervision of institutions; and the band the , which set the rules on the recovery and resolution of failing institutions and established the single resolution mechanism, respectively.  The proposals aim to implement a number of international standards into EU law, while taking into account European specificities and avoiding undue impact on the financing of the real economy.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I will deal with the capital requirements regulation, CRR, and the capital requirements directive, CRD.  The capital requirements directive IV sought to address a number of the lessons learned from the financial crisis in the years following 2008.  These lessons included the fact that banks which appeared to be resilient were found to be poorly capitalised in terms of quality and quantity of capital.  It was also evident that banks reliance on short-term liquidity had grown significantly in the period up to 2008, which resulted in financial institutions becoming heavily reliant on emergency liquidity provided by central banks as sources of short-term funding disappeared.  Other issues such as inadequate group wide risk management and insufficient governance were also revealed during the crisis.<br\/><br\/>The capital requirements directive, CRD IV, and capital requirements regulation, CRR, included, among other things, requirements for banks to hold high quality capital as well as enhancing the supervisory powers available to the component authorities in order to assess and address banks' capital, business models, governance and risk profiles.  While these reforms made the financial system more stable and resilient against many types of possible future shocks and crises, they did not comprehensively address all identified risks.  In order, therefore, to complete the reform agenda, the EU Commission introduced the proposals we are discussing today.<\/p><p>The amendments to CRD IV and CRR which are introduced in these proposals for the most part follow internationally-agreed standards.  These standards include a binding leverage ratio which seeks to prevent banks from excessively increasing debt, as well as the net stable funding ratio, which ensures that banks have stable long-term funding sources in order to prevent their vulnerability to liquidity issues.<\/p><p> Another area the proposals seek to refine is regarding the process that enables bank supervisors to impose additional capital requirements on financial institutions, often referred to as Pillar 2 requirements.  The EU Commission is looking to bring consistency and clarity to the process as the current framework allows for different interpretations meaning that the level of additional bank capital being added varies across the Union.  These proposals also introduce changes to the small and medium enterprise, SME, supporting factor which is intended to increase the provision of credit by banks to finance the real economy.  This is achieved by making it more attractive for banks to lend money to SMEs.  There are also proposed changes to help promote bank lending for infrastructure projects. <\/p><p> The other proposal from the Commission relates to recovery and resolution of financial institutions, BRRD.  The EU bank recovery and resolution directive and the accompanying Single Resolution Mechanism regulation provides authorities with more comprehensive and effective arrangements to deal with failing banks at national level, as well as co-operation arrangements to tackle cross-border banking failures.  Resolution occurs at the point when the authorities determine that a bank is failing or likely to fail, that there is no other private sector intervention that can restore the institution back to viability within a short timeframe and that normal insolvency proceedings would cause financial instability.<\/p><p> This particular proposal provides for a number of amendments to the BRRD.  First, the EU framework requires banks to comply with the minimum requirement for eligible liabilities, MREL.  This is achieved by the bank holding instruments that can be written down or bailed in if the bank is in difficultly and is placed into resolution.  The bailing in of liabilities is intended to ensure that losses are absorbed by the creditors to the bank and in doing so recapitalises the bank, allowing it to operate normally post-resolution.  The proposed amendment ensures that MREL complies with international standards in this area to prevent any unwarranted legal complexity and compliance costs due to a potentially parallel application of these rules.  A further amendment to the BRRD seeks to harmonise the powers of resolution authorities to suspend the executions of bank commitments towards third parties, known as the moratorium tool, and also looks to expand this tool to supervisory authorities.<\/p><p> There is also a proposal for an EU harmonised approach on bank creditors' insolvency ranking.  The harmonised approach would enable banks to issue debt in a new statutory category of unsecured debt available in all EU member states which would rank just below the most senior debt and other senior liabilities for the purposes of resolution.  The introduction of clear, harmonised rules on the position of bondholders in the bank creditors' hierarchy in insolvency and resolution will facilitate the way bail-in of liabilities is applied by providing greater legal certainty and therefore reducing the risk of legal challenges.<\/p><p> Overall, the Department of Finance broadly supports the proposals and believes they will further strengthen the resilience of the banking system in Europe and increase confidence both in Ireland and the European Union in the system.  We particularly welcome measures that aim to promote the financing of the real economy, both from an SME and an infrastructure perspective.<\/p><p> Before I conclude I would like to give the committee a brief update on the current position regarding banking union, to which these proposals are linked.  In 2012, the European Council agreed on a roadmap for completing economic and monetary union, EMU, based on deeper integration and mutual support.  Completing the banking union is an indispensable step to a full and deep economic and monetary union.  The first pillar of the banking union consists of the single rulebook for the supervision of banks implemented by the Single Supervisory Mechanism within banking union.  The second pillar consists of a common framework for bank resolution implemented by the single resolution board.  These two pillars have been put in place.  <\/p><p> The third pillar, a deposit insurance scheme, is currently under negotiation.  The European deposit insurance scheme, EDIS, seeks to deepen economic and monetary union and to weaken the link between banks and their national sovereigns by means of risk-sharing among all the member states in the banking union.  In the first stages of EDIS, re-insurance and co-insurance funding would be shared between the deposit insurance fund and the national participating deposit guarantee schemes.  The share of funding provided by EDIS in case of a pay-out would progressively increase.  In the final stages, EDIS would fully pay out in the event of a bank failure.  As the third pillar of the banking union project, EDIS is an essential part of the guiding principle of weakening the link between banks and sovereign, particularly since it would ensure that savings are equally protected in all banking union member states.<\/p><p> I hope the brief outline I have provided on the Commission's proposal on banking union has been useful.  We are happy to take any questions on these issues after the presentation from our colleagues from the Central Bank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Gilvarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489052700,"counter":955,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting us here today.<\/p> <p>  As the reform package being discussed maintains the principle of operational separateness between supervisory and resolution authorities the Central Bank, which houses both, is represented today by senior staff from both authorities.  I am joined by my colleague, the head of resolution, Mr. Patrick Casey. <\/p> <p>  The Central Bank, like the Department, in general welcomes these proposals.  The package will finalise important elements of the post-crisis financial reform package.  It seeks to reduce risks in the financial sector and enhance market confidence to enable further progress towards banking union.  The proposals also recognise the importance of bank funding to households and business in the EU and they include a focus on proportionality in respect of smaller, less complex firms.<\/p> <p>  A number of changes are also proposed to the bank resolution framework, as outlined by Mr. Gilvarry.  As the IMF- among many others - noted last year, the framework has, together with the Single Resolution Mechanism, significantly strengthened the resolution regime in Ireland and the EU.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance has provided an overview of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals and I do not propose to duplicate that.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of the capital requirements regulation, CRR, and directive, CRD IV, we welcome the proposal to introduce the net stable funding ratio as a harmonised binding requirement at EU level to ensure that banks and systemic investment firms have sufficient stable funding to reflect the profile of their business.  The leverage ratio is an important prudential back-stop measure, allowing risk-sensitive approaches to function while providing an appropriate baseline requirement.  Work carried out by the European Banking Authority indicates that the impact of these measures will not be disproportionate.  <\/p> <p>  As members will know, since the initial CRD IV and CRR package was finalised there has been the major change represented by the introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, for the prudential supervision of credit institutions in the euro area.  The SSM supervisory board, of which the Central Bank is a member, has been consulted on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the purposes of an ECB opinion on the package, which is currently being drafted.  The Central Bank, in its engagement on the proposals, seeks to ensure that they reflect appropriate levels of soundness and resilience, while reflecting the importance of adequate and sustainable sources of finance for households and business.  In particular, the Central Bank is focused on several issues.  Firstly, the proposal to extend the scope of the waiver from capital requirements so that it covers subsidiaries in different member states within the banking union.  To the extent that Ireland hosts subsidiaries of banks which have their headquarters in other SSM jurisdictions, our concern relates to the fact that these entities may not be appropriately capitalised on a stand-alone basis if this waiver is adopted.  Second, it is proposed to narrow the scope of Pillar 2 capital add-ons.  We are very much opposed to this.  We believe that supervisors need to retain the appropriate flexibility to adequately address emerging and evolving risks, as well as existing risks identified in the course of supervisory reviews.  Third, it is also proposed that Pillar 2 could no longer be used to address macro-prudential or systemic concerns.   While Pillar 2 should ideally be about additional capital or requirements for bank-specific risks, we think the proposed change may be premature given that the Commission has yet to publish proposals following its review of the macro-prudential framework.  Fourth, while we support enhanced proportionality, including to reporting, the proposal to allow smaller institutions to report on an annual as opposed to a quarterly basis would in fact not be helpful.  Regular reporting is the basis upon which a proportionate approach to supervision can be implemented.  A more effective approach would be to reduce the amount of information requested, rather than the frequency. <\/p> <p>  As far as the resolution framework is concerned, the proposal includes the Financial Stability Board&rsquo;s total loss absorbing capacity, TLAC, standard as a Pillar 1 requirement, but for the largest global systemically important banks only.  Other institutions, including the Irish domestic banks, will be subject to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, MREL, the calibration and application of which has been revised in this package, as Mr. Gilvarry has explained.  Many of the revisions should in general be welcomed as they provide additional clarity.  However, we do have a number of reservations with the proposed calibration, including on the reduced flexibility in setting an appropriate level of MREL and the approach taken for the subordination of bail-inable liabilities. <\/p> <p>  Another key change to be introduced in this package is the partial harmonisation of the creditor hierarchy in insolvency and resolution.  This proposal, which relies on contractual provisions, is clearly well intentioned.<\/p><p>However, an opportunity may be missed to introduce a fully harmonised statutory regime which could also provide safeguards and preference to all deposit holders. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030900002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489052700,"counter":957,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe f&aacute; choinne na gcuir i l&aacute;thair &oacute;n Roinn agus &oacute;n mBanc Ceannais.

The latter is in the lead on the negotiations and we provide our advice and views.  It should be noted that this is a process and as the discussion proceeds, the perspective of the Central Bank is informed by the Department and vice versa and a convergence of view has taken place in many respects.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's specific question, Pillar 2 is in place to allow supervisors to complement the Pillar 1 capital requirements.  Pillar 1 is basically where the directive sets out how to calculate the charge for credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.  It sets out how to calculate the amount of capital a bank needs and this is fixed and non-discretionary.  Pillar 1 provides that although Pillar 2 takes us a long way, it only takes us so far and we rely on supervisors being able to implement what is, in the post-crisis environment, a significant supervisory process in respect of firms and take the appropriate measures.  This may mean stating that the bank in question requires more capital, as is often the case, needs to beef up its systems and controls in a certain respect or must change its personnel in certain areas.  A whole range of things are needed.  This is essential for the Central Bank.  Speaking globally, one of the things that went wrong in the run-up to the crisis is that supervision had become etiolated as a force in terms of ensuring the soundness of the system.<\/p> <p>  Pillar 2, namely, the ability to apply supervisory judgment and require more, is very important.  For this reason, the Central Bank is a little uncomfortable when we see a proposal which, while not fully undermining this ability, nonetheless seeks to constrain it.  For example, whereas previously there was a fairly open list in terms of the powers we have and the measures we could take, the effort now is to make this a closed list of areas of engagement.  For example, the catch-all power to require measures or capital where risks are underestimated by Pillar 1 is removed in the proposal.  We are not comfortable with this narrowing of the way we can approach matters because things change, risks emerge and profiles are different.  <\/p> <p>  In addition, a requirement in the proposal provides that banks make the initial determination as to what should be the composition of their Pillar 2 capital.  In the view of the Central Bank, this is our decision to make, in other words, we should require that if there is a Pillar 2 charge, it should at least reflect the Pillar 1 composition.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speech","time":1489052700,"counter":961,"content":"<p>Mr. Cross's reasoning makes sense as the proposals are alarming in this area.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the total loss absorbing capacity, TLAC, standard in Pillar 1.

There is, if one likes, a split between global systemically important banks in the regime being introduced under the proposals.  For global systemically important banks, there is a Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 requirement akin to the capital regime.  This means there is a minimum requirement for total loss absorbing capital and a Pillar 2 concept or an add-on equivalent to the concept in the capital regime.<\/p> <p>  To be clear, the supervisory authorities ascertain the capital requirements of an institution on a going concern basis.  The concept of TLAC or MREL is something akin to twice that, which is the gone concern capital, so that if the firm fails in due course by virtue of the risks identified from the supervisors - if they were to come to pass - then all of the losses to emerge would be absorbed by the capital requirements.  The gone concern capital, which sits on top of the regulatory capital, is usually in the form of debt and this element can then facilitate the recapitalisation of an institution to avoid taxpayer bailouts.  That is the broad concept. <\/p> <p>  We would be supportive of a distinction being drawn in the package between the global systemically important banks and the other banks.  The Deputy may ask why we support this distinction.  Given that the larger banks operate on a multinational basis, they need to meet a standard amount of Pillar 1 requirement.  This distinguishes them from other banks, for example, institutions in Ireland where we favour setting minimum requirements on an institution-specific basis, thus keeping the architecture that is currently on the Statute Book.

All this is about trying to find the right balance.  As the Deputy will be aware, the discussion around the leverage ratio has gone on for a number of years and among those discussions was the question of what is its purpose.  For example, is it the primary thing and should we just focus in on the leverage ratio?  The Americans would be closer to this position and they would say the leverage ratio is really the primary thing.  In Europe, and this reflects a variety of factors, our view is that we do not want to lose risk sensitivity where we can safely retain it.  In some areas, we are not as confident as we might be that having risk sensitive capital requirements will work, so there are changes taking place in that regard.  However, where one can retain risk sensitivity, one should do so.  That is why we have the standardised approach and the internal relations based approach, and so on.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, we know that using risk sensitivity, models and credit ratings has weaknesses, so it is important that one has something else.  Therefore, the leverage ratio is designed as a backstop.  It should not be biting unduly in terms of acting as the first line of defence but it should be there.  If a firm has low levels of capital and that is being driven by the risk assessment of its assets, we need to be sure there is enough capital to support the overall size of the balance sheet.  From our point of view, that has come out of the right place.  It is a backstop and 3% is the right backstop, in our view, although discussion is going on about G-SIBs, global systemically important firms, and potentially about other systemically important firms.  For now, we are comfortable that, as a backstop, it is the right thing.  However, of course, it is combined with a whole range of other measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030900002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross"},{"type":"speech","time":1489052700,"counter":969,"content":"<p>I have one final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030900002#G00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1489052700,"counter":970,"content":"<p>We are pressed for time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030900002#G00700","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1489052700,"counter":971,"content":"<p>The question would be helpful for the Department as well.

Given what has been brought in under CRD IV - the capital requirement directive IV - and some of the proposals here, some of which we do not agree with, as the Central Bank has outlined in regard to the macroprudential side and the limitations on the add-ons, we now have a framework whereby there is better quality capital and higher levels of capital.  Even before we moved to that, however, there was a more intensive and more consistent engagement from the competent authorities with the entities in regard to looking at the business model to see what is the capital.  Therefore, we have the higher level of capital and the better quality capital, and we then have the MREL concept which means that, if an entity is getting into difficulty, we start to bail in assets, which we did not see in our situation in 2008.  We have the fund, which is one of the reasons the Department and the Minister have been very vocal in regard to the third pillar of banking union.  We need to complete banking union so we do not have a situation where, if financial institutions get into difficulty, the link goes back to the Exchequer - to the sovereign.  That is why it is so important to complete the work on EDIS but it is also quite important from a single resolution fund perspective that we have a common backstop and that we have full mutualisation as quickly as possible in order to eliminate any risk there is a call on the Exchequer in that event.  Nonetheless, we have those other steps and those extra powers to ensure there is enough capital and enough instruments to be bailed in before we start moving towards the fund.<\/p> <p>  On the leverage ratio, I would agree with my colleagues from the Central Bank that the one thing that should be remembered is that the leverage ratio is there with the other instruments, so it is another indicator for the supervisor to decide there is an issue.  We have the 3% for normal banks and potentially higher levels for the G-SIBs.  From a European perspective, we have a very different model to the US.  In particular, the US institutions do not hold the same level of mortgages on their balance sheets as we do because of what we call the Government-sponsored entitles, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  There is a much bigger securitisation market which is, in essence, state-sponsored and which we have in Europe.  Therefore, the leverage ratio does not bite as much for them when compared to ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030900002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Gilvarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1489052700,"counter":973,"content":"<p>The Department said it wanted to introduce amendments to two key areas, the capital requirement regulation, CRR, and the capital requirement directive, CRD, which were adopted in 2013 as potential requirements for institutions and rules on governance and supervision of the institutions operating in Europe.

As a competent authority, it is a question of asking if the changes to the powers of a competent authority make sense and will ensure we will still have a strong and resilient framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030900002#J01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver Gilvarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1489052700,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>If there is the potential for a 0.3% to 0.7% fall EU-wide, do we have any understanding or feel for whether it will be lesser or greater here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017030900002#J01500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489052700,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>Coming back to the institutions we have here, we do not have GSIB entities, for example.

We hope the Chairman of the committee, Deputy John McGuinness, will arrive at a later stage.  I remind Deputies to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as the interference associated with such devices can cause serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  We are considering the Revised Estimates for 2017 of the Public Expenditure and Reform Vote group.  I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for financial services, e-Government and public procurement, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  On 15 December 2016, the D&aacute;il ordered that the following Revised Estimates be referred to this committee for consideration: Vote 11 - Public Expenditure and Reform, Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, Vote 14 - State Laboratory, Vote 15 - Secret Service, Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service, Vote 18 - National Shared Services Office, Vote 19 - Office of the Ombudsman, and Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement.  I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and their accompanying officials.  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the Revised Estimates and the supplementary performance information regarding the outputs and impacts of programme expenditure.  The 2017 total allocation for the Public Expenditure and Reform group of eight Votes is approximately &euro;509 million.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#A01000","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":1021,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for giving me an opportunity to attend today's meeting.  I will speak briefly on my overall Vote before facilitating as many questions as possible.  As the Chair has said, this Vote group comprises the Votes for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Office of Government Procurement and the National Shared Services Office; the Votes for the offices under the aegis of my Department, which are the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service and the Office of the Ombudsman; and the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances, which covers Civil Service pensions, and the Secret Service.  The Vote for the remaining element of the Public Expenditure and Reform group - the Office of Public Works - is handled separately by this committee.<\/p> <p> The structure of this Vote remains unchanged in 2017.  There are two strategic programmes, one focusing on public expenditure and sectoral policy and the other focusing on public service management and reform.  The requested staffing and funding resources for each programme are set out in the third part of the Estimate.  With regard to the objective of the first of the two programmes, the select committee will be aware that the timetable envisaged by the Government for the 2018 Estimates process includes a spending review in advance of the budget.  While moderate and sustainable expenditure growth is planned over the medium term, there are emerging and competing public service demands.  It is intended that the spending review process will help to broaden the Government's options during the budgetary process by creating fiscal space to fund new policies from within existing ceilings through a systemic review of the existing cost base.<\/p> <p>  In parallel with this approach, my Department will continue to work on planning the capital review, which will be concluded later this year.  The objective of the capital review is to provide a focused analysis of capital spending and to outline what can realistically be delivered over the remainder of the plan utilising the additional resources that are now available.  The increase in gross expenditure on the Public Expenditure and Reform Vote for 2017 will bring the total gross allocation to &euro;56 million.  This additional allocation will provide for cross-Government measures and is driven by a number of factors such as the progress of the Government's commitments under the public service ICT strategy, the advancement of Civil Service learning and development, the facilitation of an electronic exchange of information between the State and the EU Commission, the implementation of the single public service pension scheme across the public service, the development of the Government's economic and evaluation service and the work of the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p> <p>  I would like to reflect briefly on the future of public service reform so that we can continue to focus on improving services.  Two successive plans have been delivered by my Department over the past five years.  They have enabled us to maintain and improve services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets.  Between 2009 and 2014, the Exchequer pay bill was reduced by over a fifth and staff numbers were reduced by a third.  These reforms were implemented at a time of increased demand for many essential public services, such as welfare payments, medical cards, school places and pensions.  In December 2016, I was pleased to see many positive messages about how our public services are performing by comparison with such services in other countries.  According to the Institute of Public Administration's public service trends report for 2016, our public administration is the most professional and least politicised in the 28 EU member states.  Our public service is considered one of the least bureaucratic in Europe.  We also scored highly for the quality of our public administration and in the rating of perceptions that Government decisions are effectively administered.<\/p> <p>  We are continually looking for ways to improve customer experiences.  Last month, my Department published a survey of business customers of the Civil Service.  The survey was carried out to meet a commitment in the public service reform plan.  I am pleased that levels of satisfaction with the service received and the outcome of the business interaction have improved by over 15% since the last survey in 2009.  It is not surprising to note that the way business engages with the Civil Service is changing fundamentally.  Some 83% of businesses now interact via online services, compared to just 33% in 2009.  This helps how we plan for the future.<\/p><p> Work is now under way on a survey of Irish public customers and will assess satisfaction with, and perceptions of, services provided to the public by the Civil Service.  My Department is currently engaging across the public service on the preparation of the next phase of reform to cover the period from 2017 to 2020.  The draft plan will then be informed by a period of public consultation in the spring, with a view to publication by mid-2017.  In addition, I published a second progress report on Civil Service renewal in July.  I again invite members to provide input into the Department's general plans on public service renewal.<\/p><p> I will now turn briefly to the issue of public service pay.  I have outlined that the Government will take a two-phased approach.  We have now completed phase one and the additional spending arising from the Government decision in respect of the anomaly payment for those staff within the Lansdowne Road agreement, aside from members of the Garda, is a one-off cost of &euro;120 million in 2017.  The required funds must be met from available public resources while taking into account the scope for reallocation of expenditure and continuing to meet the Government's commitment to core public services.  The Government will monitor the position closely and will consider how best to meet any additional funding requirements where the need arises.<\/p><p> We are now beginning phase two, during which we hope to negotiate a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Before we begin those negotiations, we await the report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The commission&rsquo;s role is to provide evidence-based objective analysis and as I have argued this morning, I believe strongly that a collective approach to public service pay is vital to our national interest and never more so than at a time of international flux.  Collective agreements deliver public service reform, secure productivity improvements and allow for planning.  They allow us to balance pay increases in the public service with other priorities like education, housing and the issues debated in the House last night.<\/p><p> In addition to progress in public service reform, I continue to be committed to political reform and real progress has been made in this year.  An area of current focus will be the general scheme for a data sharing and governance Bill and the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015, which I aim to bring to Committee Stage by April.  In addition, my Department has undertaken the first review of the operation of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 and of the system for State board appointments.  I will publish both of these reports shortly.<\/p><p> Turning now to the other Votes, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has responsibility in respect of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  Members will aware that procurement reform is an important element of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to reform.  In this regard, the net allocation for the OGP in 2017 is estimated at &euro;19.96 million, compared with &euro;19.982 million in 2016.  In the four years to the end of 2016, the OGP and its partner sector sourcing organisations in health, education, local government and defence had enabled cost reduction savings of the order of &euro;300 million.  Total cost reduction savings for 2017 are between &euro;80 million and &euro;100 million and this represents a very significant portion of overall Government spending.  By putting in place procurement arrangements, the aim is to achieve economies of scale and maximum value for money while balancing other requirements, including societal considerations and SME access.<\/p><p> Members also will be aware that the National Shared Services Office within my Department is leading the shared services strategy within the overall reform and renewal context.  We are making good progress across all aspects of this reform agenda.  The Civil Service HR and pensions administration shared service centre, PeoplePoint, now provides services for 34,500 civil servants from 39 public service bodies.  The payroll shared service centre, PSSC, has 103,000 payees, of whom 57,000 are pensioners, from 43 different Government organisations.  The financial management shared services project has begun the development of a new finance technology solution for the Government.  The introduction of this single finance technology platform will replace 31 existing finance systems across Departments and offices and will facilitate transaction processing in the finance shared service centre.  This is why a provision of &euro;45.173 million is sought for Vote 18 and these projects which, by their nature, require a certain amount of upfront investment. <\/p><p> Vote 12, for superannuation and retired allowances, primarily provides for pension and retirement lump sum costs for civil servants, including prison officers, and pension payments for dependants.  Year-to-year variation in expenditure on this Vote is primarily driven by the number of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age and whose years of service and grade and pay level are variable and uncertain.<\/p><p> The Estimate I am proposing today, involving a net provision of &euro;359.9 million, represents a decrease of some &euro;32 million or an 8% drop on the 2016 net Estimate.  This decrease in provision is largely attributable to an increase in contributions from the single public service pension scheme.<\/p><p> The committee has been supplied with details of various other Votes but I will leave it at that for now.  I commend the 2017 Estimates to the select committee and I will be happy to answer any questions which may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#A01100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening remarks and now call on Deputy Sherlock to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#B00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>I thank the Minster and his officials for attending today's meeting.

The breakdown for tribunals is &euro;314 million, of which the Mahon tribunal represented a cost of &euro;119 million and the Moriarty tribunal a cost of &euro;54 million.

I think we all agree that these are important issues that should be the subject of tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation.  However, does Deputy Donohoe, in his role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, believe there is now a case to be made for these costs to be considered?  I imagine the vast bulk of them are legal costs which accrue to legal practices.  Has the Minister given any thought to the idea that we need to find some mechanism whereby truth and justice are sought and reported on in a way that does not put such a burden on the taxpayer?  I take the point the Minister may make about the relatively recent referendum and so on but I do not believe that the Irish taxpayer wants to continue to bear these costs, particularly if they are, in the main, legal costs.  There may now be some need for reform of this process because it is arguable that it is unsustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#B00500","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>As I said to the Deputy earlier, I want to be very careful, particularly in the context of the public debate that took place recently on the setting up of a tribunal on certain disclosures and in the context of the debate taking place in the D&aacute;il today.  I wish to be very clear in recognising that there are truths in our society that need a form of inquiry.  At each point of the process are the people and then the Oireachtas, and Governments have had to respond to the question of how we can get to those truths.  All the information the Deputy has asked for I have given him, and all the information I have shared with the committee is in the spirit of recognising the need to deal correctly and fairly with certain matters.  Alongside this, the issue of cost must be considered.  For this very reason, the House, this Government and the previous Government developed the concept of commissions of inquiry and investigation.  They offer a different way of dealing with the kinds of truths we are debating and they have brought a different level of predictability and control to costs that the taxpayer may face.  It is incumbent on all of us - and this is the attitude that has been shown by colleagues here - to be aware that as we consider the form of inquiry that is necessary, we are also conscious of issues that will develop in the future regarding how we conduct inquiries.  This is a matter on which the Comptroller and Auditor General has already commented.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said in a report in 2008, \"The State faces a considerable challenge to achieve predictability and financial control in the case of tribunals of inquiry which operate under the authority of the legislature without compromising their independent investigations or the constitutional rights of witnesses.\"  This points to a challenge we have, that is, even if we do all the work we can on issues such as rates payable to legal counsel, once the Oireachtas makes a decision on the setting up of an independent commission of inquiry or a tribunal, parties to that then have rights that they will seek to have vindicated.  We then must trust, as we do, a person of standing in our State to make decisions about the conduct of that commission, which invests in him or her an independence.  Alongside this, my Department will do all it can, as will the Department of Justice and Equality, to ensure that this work is done in an affordable and sustainable way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#C00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>I take the point the Minister makes.  Ultimately, it is the Minister's Department that will sign the cheque, or through which the cheque will come, regarding the fees structure and the entirety of the costs.  Lest there be any ambiguity about my position on this, let me state that the right to have one's rights vindicated and be represented legally is absolutely sacrosanct, and I think we would all agree with that.  However, is there a process by which costs can be capped while recognising the rights of all parties before a commission of investigation or a tribunal of inquiry?  Going back to the 2008 report, it seems that if the Comptroller and Auditor General is acknowledging the spiralling costs - at the risk of putting words into his mouth - then those costs are out of control.  They are astronomical and ridiculous as regards the pursuit of justice or truth, depending on the content of the inquiry.  The Irish taxpayer has the right to ensure that the most cost-effective mechanism is used, even if this means legislating for an upper cap on costs per hour or whatever formula is used to determine costs.  I put it to the Minister that it is not possible for the Irish taxpayer to sustain over ten years a cost of &euro;420.593 million.  There needs to be a policy shift somewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#C00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>Regarding commissions of inquiry, we have structures in place to deal with the matter of legal costs.  On tribunals of inquiry, this is a matter in respect of which we rely on the leadership of the person leading the tribunal.  It must be acknowledged that Mr. Justice Charleton, who is leading the disclosures tribunal, has already been very clear about his view on cost.  That was a decision and a statement he made and one I certainly welcome.  My Department will fulfil its role as best as possible - along with the Department of Justice - in dealing with the issue of cost.  However, I wish to make one point in this regard, and I do so again in the spirit of acknowledging the need to interrogate the truth about very important matters.  This is an issue of which Deputy Brendan Howlin, Deputy Sherlock's party leader, would have been aware.  Deputy Howlin previously held my position and it was he who introduced the legislation on commissions of inquiry.  As was his right, Deputy Howlin called for a tribunal of inquiry in this instance in light of everything we have learned.  This is why I believe tribunals of inquiry should be used carefully.

How are the politics of that being played out at European Council level?  We are facing uncertain times and there is turbulence ahead.  It is not enough for the authors to describe the scenario here; there must be more about where the European Commission or the Council intervene to assist us to meet the Stability and Growth Pact and other targets in order that we can meet the challenges of the so-called \"clouds on the horizon\", to use their phrase.

The Taoiseach has also directed that he wants a longer-term capital plan drawn up across a ten-year horizon, which we will act on.

I am considering the role of public, private partnerships, PPPs,  but I will be careful with them.  I know, as a former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the role that PPPs played in delivering road projects all over the country, for example.

Those bullet payments can be very considerable, not just in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport but also in the Departments of Education and Skills and Health.  In the former, they can amount to tens of millions of euro per year.  My recollection is that across the coming years and across all of the PPPs that we have delivered, the accumulated value of the bullet payments is between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion.  Those payments are spread over a longer time period which is why PPPs are attractive but, as I said earlier, we need to be really careful with them.  Just because a liability does not sit directly on the sovereign balance sheet does not mean the liability does not exist.

One of the things that this Government has been stressing, as we approach the formal start of the Article 50 negotiations, is the importance of putting in place transitional arrangements to act as a safety net for the market.  This will ensure that as we go through the negotiation process, dealing with the terms of the exit and the terms of any new arrangements, there will be clarity for financial services firms as to where we are going.  The international financial services sector is the plumbing and architecture that is underneath most economies, in terms of finance for small and medium enterprises - not just those enterprises that export and trade but also those with a domestic focus.  We must make sure that as we go through this process there is not too much volatility for them to face that might disrupt their businesses, if, for example, the negotiations do not go well in a particular week.  We must also ensure that as we approach the end of the two-year negotiation period, the potential cliff-edge scenario is not used for brinkmanship.<\/p> <p>  I have been relaying that message very strongly to my counterparts in Europe.  I met the Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, with responsibility for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union last week, Commissioner Dombrovskis.  I had flagged that to the committee a number of weeks before going over.  I raised the importance of that issue with the Commissioner.  I also raised my concerns around regulatory arbitrage or competition happening in the European space at the moment as people vie to attract business from London.  I stressed the importance of not lowering standards in any part of the Single Market because given the current interconnectedness, there would be a spillover if a company of significance were to move to a jurisdiction on a promise that could not be delivered.  I discussed that with the Commissioner and with members of the ECON committee.  <\/p> <p>  I presented a paper on risks and opportunities to the Brexit Cabinet sub-committee in November 2016.  So far this year I have had a number of consultations here and in London with different sectors to make sure we are across all the risks and opportunities.  There is a potential opportunity for job creation, that is true.  I spoke about that yesterday in the wake of one announcement of a company in the insurance sector that is not coming here.  There will be an ebb and flow to this.  Jobs will relocate out of London; they will not all come to Ireland but we will get more than our fair share, in my view.  That will act as some sort of mitigation against the down sides and risks that exist for other sectors in our economy.

My feeling is that the reason AIG is not coming to Ireland has nothing to do with any shortcoming on our part.

AIG has a strong business in Ireland, does good work and has invested in our economy and jobs.<\/p> <p>  The Acting Chairman will undoubtedly have seen today's statement from the Central Bank about the number of applications from insurance entities that it has received and is progressing.

IFS2020 has a target of increasing our offering by 30%, or approximately 10,000 jobs, over a five-year period.  According to last year's figures, the current figure is just under 40,000.  As we increase the number further, I am committed to maintaining at least one third of the overall number outside of Dublin.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  As we came off the back of the summer months last year, we understood that businesses would not wait for the Article 50 process to begin.  Some knew that the time horizons for relocating - the application process and moving staff across - would take longer than the two-year period.  We continue to work with many uncertainties, but businesses like certainty.  When they undertook due diligence exercises prior to the referendum result, many noticed benefits in consolidating their various business arrangements in different parts of Europe.  Ireland figured strongly in certain regards.<\/p> <p>  As we approached the end of the year, it became clear to us that they were going to start making decisions in the first half of this year.  That has happened.  I must be careful about managing expectations, though.

That will happen; there will be an ebb and flow.<\/p> <p>  We cannot yet put a number on the companies.  In Davos, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, referred to there being more than 100 expressions of interest to the IDA.  In the insurance field alone, I understand that the Central Bank has received five to ten applications for authorisation and a further 20 companies are at the pre-application stage.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult for us to discuss the exact number of companies for a couple of reasons.  Some will choose Ireland.  They will make that decision with their boards in the coming months and submit their applications.  Others will choose Ireland as a contingency that they do not need to trigger until much later in the process, so the number is difficult to know.  One Asian bank that I have dealt with decided that Dublin would be its gateway into the Single Market.  That is the play that we have been making strongly into Asia.  The bank's initial figure was in the teens, which was good considering the bank in question, but having monitored the situation as it has developed, that number will grow.  If such companies cannot put a number on it, though, neither can I.

Something that we decided as part of an outreach programme was to use Members in their constituencies, given that they speak with small businesses week in, week out about their procurement concerns.  We decided to go on a roadshow and, through political offices and the chambers, invited them to meetings where we could explain what the OGP had been doing in recent years, give advice on using eTenders and so on, and take questions and feedback.  We did that in UCC in December.  A number of businesses attended that positive engagement.  It was important for me to hear directly their feedback about some of the problems that they had been experiencing, given that second guessing our officials is an important role that every Minister must play in terms of undertaking a critical analysis of our functions.  We have just had a meeting in Galway.  It was very good, with even more businesses in attendance.  We are planning for meetings in Mayo and Sligo in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  While we must keep reforming this space, it is important to note that 95% of the State's goods and services are procured from Irish-based companies, with the majority being SMEs.  However, we still do not have the right way of qualifying an SME.  We are working to European standards, which refer to 250 employees or less.  When we discuss SMEs, though, most of us are not talking about a company that is so large.  One of the pieces of work that we are undertaking with industry is determining how to get figures for micro-enterprises - companies of ten or 20 people - that feel like they are losing out to some of the new procurement processes that we introduced.  We lot contracts together before breaking them back down again by regions, but enterprises might not be aware of that.  In one industry, the average tender might only have been &euro;20,000, which would be below the &euro;25,000 threshold, but because the OGP decided to lump contracts together, enterprises were not aware, did not receive notifications, were not registered on eTenders and missed out.  We now have metrics in place to improve this situation, but the main purpose of my outreach in each constituency is to let small businesses know that matters have changed.  This does not mean that they have to lose out.  We must be mindful that we work in a Single Market.  While trying to favour SMEs, we cannot shut out other European companies.  However, it is also worth noting - I can get the committee the exact figures - that we do better from procurement in other European countries than companies from those countries do from procurement in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#F01300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":1073,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke to Deputy Sherlock about the public service commission, which is ongoing, and how he envisages its timeline.

I am very privileged to have been asked to come.  To quickly give the committee some background information, I was chief executive of the Community Relations Council in Northern Ireland for ten years.  I am currently at Ulster University as a lecturer and director of community engagement.  I have produced an outline paper which I will not read as it is too long and I understand I only have five to seven minutes before questions are taken.  If I go over the time allowed, I apologise in advance.<\/p> <p>  It is hard to exaggerate the level of achievement the Good Friday Agreement represents and the effort that went into it.  People need to be really clear that it did not come from nowhere; it came from engagement on quite important and difficult historical issues and was ratified in a popular vote.  It led to serious changes in the Irish Constitution and legislation.  <\/p> <p>  In spite of the fact that the system of devolution has been relatively stable since 2007, it is still fragile in 2017.  In 2010 there was a crisis over policing that led to the Hillsborough Agreement; in 2012 and 2013 there were flags protests; in 2013 and 2014 there were parade issues' in 2013 there were the Haass negotiations; in 2014 there was the Stormont House Agreement; in 2015 there was the Fresh Start agreement and this year there have been new Assembly elections.  The situation remains very fragile, particularly in the North.  In the middle of all this the Brexit decision in the referendum in the United Kingdom is a really significant act.<\/p><p>The two most difficult aspects of it are, first, that it is a unilateral Act in a context where the Good Friday Agreement was a joint and consensual agreement of which all of its bits were to fit a part and, second, it puts in question many of the issues in Northern Ireland.  Uncertainty represents a really serious challenge in the context of the fragility that exists in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> There are a number of things I will talk about beyond that.  I was asked to speak about the implications for the Good Friday Agreement.  Unilateralism in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and uncertainty are both really serious and significant issues, all of which have potentially very major knock-on effects in a context of fragility.<\/p><p> In terms of the referendum, the Northern Ireland turnout was relatively low.  Participation was unusually high in middle class areas such as south Belfast and north Down.  In west Belfast and Foyle, it was the lowest in the UK.  It took a long time to catch fire in some of the republican heartland.  North Antrim is the only constituency in Northern Ireland in which more than 60% voted to leave.  All the constituencies touching the Border voted to remain.  That leaves us with a number of specific issues.  Something to reflect on is that public debate was relatively muted in Northern Ireland.  The strongest media warnings about the implications of Brexit for peace and reconciliation came from the Taoiseach and former British Prime Ministers who have a personal stake in the Good Friday Agreement.  <\/p><p> I looked at the Good Friday Agreement in detail to see where peace and reconciliation touches on it in a very specific and direct way.  Reconciliation is at the centre of the whole deal.  It is in the preamble and starts the whole event.  I picked two phrases from the first three paragraphs.  The first is, \"We firmly dedicate ourselves to the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust, and to the protection and vindication of the human rights of all.\"  The second is, \"We are committed to partnership, equality and mutual respect as the basis of relationships within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between these islands.\"  The questions this raises are at a fundamental level part of the issue.  We will get practical but this is very fundamental.  How far does Brexit represent a unilateral change to the concepts outlined, in particular mutuality and partnership?  What does it do to the Good Friday Agreement?  What is the status of it?  To what extent is Brexit coming at reconciliation from outside and not taking it into account at all?  Where there are incompatibilities, does reconciliation in Ireland have to be accommodated to Brexit or can Brexit be accommodated to reconciliation as it impacts on Northern Ireland?  The question of the priority of those two things is absolutely central here.  <\/p><p> There are also a number of areas, which I have outlined, that are really significant in terms of specific issues, one of which is the citizenship arrangements.  The citizenship arrangements outlined in the Good Friday Agreement were unique and radical.  There is a commitment to \"recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose, and accordingly confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.\"  That means that for all the people who live in the territory of Northern Ireland, there is an ongoing citizenship interest in the European Union.  The European citizenship of all the citizens of Northern Ireland remains, which is a complex and unique circumstance.<\/p><p> The Good Friday Agreement says the North-South bodies are integral so we cannot abolish or unilaterally change them without unilaterally changing the other institutions because they are interlocking.  The interlocking principle is significant and important.  <\/p><p> It also says the North-South Ministerial Council will consider the European Union dimension of relevant matters so Brexit will have direct consequences for that.  The agreement says the North-South Ministerial Council will consider it, \"including the implementation of EU policies and programmes and proposals under consideration in the EU framework.\"  What is the status of those elements of the agreement following Brexit?  It seems to me to be very specific in terms of the future of the North-South bodies.  <\/p><p> There has been a discussion about the language of special status.  The only issue at stake here under the agreement is the question of status not specialness.  The agreement makes provisions \"[I]n recognition of the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland and of the extent to which issues of mutual concern arise in relation to Northern Ireland\".  I will not go into it in further detail apart from saying the specialness of Northern Ireland is already present in the agreement.  It is not a new concept; it is already present in the agreement.  <\/p><p> There are a number of specific elements here which are of particular importance.  Security co-operation is highlighted as a specific issue.  One of the most complicated issues around Brexit is the way in which Brexit is presented by those who support it as a way to bring national security by strengthening borders.  I should be very clear that I am not one of those.  The Good Friday Agreement operates from the exact opposite principle, which is that security is created by cross-Border co-operation and by inter-state action.  The implications for security of a cross-Border-based security in the context of a strengthening Border are also of direct importance.  <\/p><p> The more complicated elements of the agreement for inside Northern Ireland are parity of esteem and equality.  It says \"the power of the sovereign government with jurisdiction there [the United Kingdom] shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality on behalf of all the people in the diversity of their identities and traditions and shall be founded on the principles of full respect for, and equality of, civil, political, social and cultural rights ... and of parity of esteem and of just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos, and aspirations of both communities.\"  In the context of Brexit and what it means in terms of aspiration, ethos and so on, there is a question about how it interacts with and is affected as a result of this.<\/p><p> The agreement makes explicit and direct reference to the central role of the European Convention on Human Rights but the convention remains formally untouched by this particular Act because it belongs to the Council of Europe rather than the European Union.  There are political issues in the background around the future of the convention which need to be retained in mind.<\/p><p> May I speak for another three minutes? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Duncan Morrow","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489071600,"counter":1179,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#C00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489071600,"counter":1180,"content":"<p>I will outline some of the implications for peace and reconciliation, identity and political stability in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland.  Uncertainty over crucial issues always poses risks in societies where division is deeply rooted and stability is fragile.  Brexit has potentially uncertain implications for identity, borders, equality, parity of esteem and cross-Border relationships in Ireland and hence for the political, economic and security well-being of Ireland and Northern Ireland in particular.  Whatever happens, it will touch on those issues.  It cannot be understood without understanding and touching on those issues.<\/p> <p>  Two dimensions pose particular difficulties.  First, the unilateral nature of the Brexit decision means that the central elements of British-Irish partnership and the cultural and social equality that underpins co-operation in Northern Ireland are raised.  Second, as a result, reconciliation in Northern Ireland appears to be a second-order consideration for the UK in light of Brexit.  It has not factored in, in any detailed way, the ramifications of the decision for Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  British-Irish was the alternative to British or Irish in the Agreement.  That is clear from the citizenship arrangements.  The unresolved question is: has this been unilaterally abandoned?<\/p><p>The result is a climate of uncertainty which, in and of itself, is complicated.  Since we do not know what Brexit will involve, the discussion about it is problematic simply because of the uncertainty.  I find myself in the position of being caught between needing to raise an alarm without wishing to be alarmist but it is critical that we begin to get something under the floor of this now because the uncertainty surrounding it is a problem.<\/p><p> I have outlined six possible options which still appear to be possible.  They include, a hard border implemented against the will of Irish nationalism, so a unilateral act that would create a hard border or it emerging from either EU or UK law; a soft border, which represents a deviation from mainstream UK practice, unsettling unionism; an articulated Brexit, which is what the SNP wants, where we would have different Brexits for each part of the United Kingdom with different regional implications for the UK; special regional status for Northern Ireland on the Good Friday Agreement model, including a special and permanent role for Ireland; a fifth option, which is not currently on the table, that Ireland would leave the EU; and a sixth option, Northern Ireland as secondary unplanned collateral to the priority of other agendas: an agenda taker, not an agenda maker, with the sense of us being a bubble in the middle of a sea where we will be the small part that we represent in numbers.  I do not want to go through those options in detail other than to refer to them.  <\/p><p> There are fundamental assumptions about the Good Friday Agreement.  The issues of sovereignty and personal and community identity are very clearly separated in the Good Friday Agreement.  It now appears unclear as to how they will now be put forward.  This unique formulation has allowed the question of the Border to recede from the politics of Ireland since 1998.  An open Border facilitated close co-operation and gave reality to the aspiration of the Agreement to vindicate the multiple and complex identities of Northern Ireland.  Brexit, especially where it disrupts the practical experience of Irish or British identity or the equality extended to both, creates doubts and uncertainties about the compact at the heart of the Agreement.<\/p><p> The evidence of the Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey has been about growing Irish identity but also a willingness to accommodate that within Northern Ireland.  The evidence of divided societies everywhere is that the implications of unilateral decisions for identity and cultural issues may be more specific and potentially dangerous in the long run than the specific economic questions.  Therefore, we also have to address the cultural and social questions.<\/p><p> There is the issue of uncertainty and the Brexit decision being an unilateral decision.  Another significant issue is that divisions over Brexit within the Northern Ireland Executive have so far disabled the devolved institutions as vehicles for representing these vital interests with any consistency or coherence during negotiations.  There is a real problem.  I was talking about this outside the committee room.  The requirement for reconciliation is to find common ground.  The implication of Brexit is that we will be pulled apart.  That gives right to the question of how do those things go together.   <\/p><p> After Brexit, Northern Ireland will remain a unique territory in the United Kingdom where all citizens retain the ongoing right to Irish citizenship, and hence to citizenship of the European Union.  The issue of protection of citizens and citizen rights within the United Kingdom on a sub-territorial basis therefore applies on a unique basis to Northern Ireland and will give Ireland a special status within one part of the UK which does not apply anywhere else.<\/p><p> The geographical distribution of support for Brexit is significant in Northern Ireland.  Support for Brexit is strongest in Unionist-supporting areas outside Belfast and weaker elsewhere.  In both Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the majorities were against leaving the EU, this has reopened the most contentious question about the sovereignty of the UK.  In the Northern Ireland Assembly elections last week, in four of the five constituencies touching the Border, four of the seats are now held by Nationalists.  That means that the Border will run through those areas which are most firmly Nationalist and the imposition of that Border will have significant issues.  <\/p><p> Closing Border crossings is another specific issue.  The symbolic importance of State visits in recent years has been very important.  We need to be mindful of to what extend would Brexit compromise that.<\/p><p> The future of North-South bodies, the customs implications for agriculture, food and services are necessarily uncertain.  Trade and economic integration have been understood as critical contributors to peace-building and disrupting that would create a problem. <\/p><p> Security and policing co-operation has been one of the most important aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.  The recent Fresh Start agreement established further cross-Border working with regard to organised crime.  While everybody remains committed to the rule of law, and it is important to say that, the potential for this pillar of the agreement to be undermined by Brexit is considerable, especially in the case where smuggling and-or cross-Border crime escalates or the Border requires a reinforcement of the physical presence of security forces, including customs officials and immigration officials in large numbers.  Any deterioration of community relations in Northern Ireland is likely to have security implications on the Border.  Funding is an obvious issue, including the long-term potential of EU funding.<\/p><p> I was asked for practical solutions.  The language of special status for Northern Ireland is already present and stated in the Good Friday Agreement.  It could be argued that not to recognise special status would be a breach of that Agreement.  What is clear is that Northern Ireland's concerns for stability and a continuing and seamless expression of Irish citizenship and identity require a unique answer and focus.  To date,  most of the debate on Article 50 has focused on establishing a new basis for economic and trading relationships.  Given that Brexit raises significant issues of identity, freedom of movement and reconciliation for Ireland, I would like to see Ireland asking for a specific strand of the Brexit negotiations designed to deal directly with the protection of the Good Friday Agreement as an element as of the EU negotiations in 2017.  I do not know how that would happen but I would like it to see it being addressed as a specific issue and for it to be seen as an important sub-stream and not as not simply as an add-on.  The Good Friday Agreement foresaw an ongoing civic element to public life in Northern Ireland.  Given the disabling of the political element, it is important to find as many civic contexts within which those issues, at a very practical level, can be addressed, whether they be in the context of business, agriculture, tourism, infrastructure, education, community or culture.  As a first step, would it be possible for possibly the Irish Government or the European Union to commission a detailed study into the potential implications of Brexit for reconciliation which would set a bottom line.  The gap between alarm and alarmism will only be filled by some evidence and some moving into that space, which identifies that these are the specific issues.  My view would be that we should draw on and talk to political and civic sources but also identify quantitative and qualitative issues which may impinge on reconciliation and stability in detail.  This could provide an important early document indicating in detail what these concerns are about and would give a basis for a conversation which can then be negotiated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Duncan Morrow","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489071600,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Morrow.

The good wine was kept until the end.  It is the first time I have heard the suggestion he made in all the discussions that have taken place.   That is the key point I will take from what he had to say.  When we were in Brussels during the week, we heard that Ireland has a dramatic position in the EU.  The EU started out as the European Economic Community, EEC, but, as I have stated here previously, that acronym should refer to \"extraordinary exceptional circumstances\".  If we consider the modern period of the EU, there have been extraordinary and unique circumstances.  As a Deputy who represents a party that is not in government, I was a bit sceptical at the outset of the process of civil dialogue, but, to be fair, the process has been exceptional.  With the exception of what Dr. Morrow said at the end of his contribution, the process of identifying the strands, the threads and issues have been dealt with.  We should take on board what he has said with respect to setting up a process to make sure that there is a reconciliation because that is what community is about.  That is what this whole process is about.  It is about people.<\/p> <p>  On foot of my visit as part of a delegation to Brussels this week, I am confident that in the triggering of Article 50, while not happy with the British situation, the issue of the Good Friday Agreement and the understanding Brussels has of it and the peace process, will be recognised from the outset as soon as this article is triggered.<\/p><p>The sooner that happens, the better because it has created a vacuum.  Dr. Morrow spoke of uncertainty; a vacuum creates uncertainty.<\/p><p> I thank Dr. Morrow for his presentation and support his comments.  As I have stated on previous occasions, I lived through the Troubles and the peace process.  I also remember when Ireland was not a member of the European Union, as will most of the older people present.  The economy will suffer if there is any indication that communities may not engage.  It would be a retrograde step to unravel the process of engagement, North and South.  Much of this engagement and the work local authorities and communities have been doing along the Border have gone unsung.<\/p><p> Yesterday the heading in my local newspaper referred to the division of the diocese of Armagh.  I had not thought of the implications of Brexit from the perspective of religious structures.  New issues arise daily.

I thank him for the work he has done on his important submission.  Many of my colleagues and I have been travelling from one meeting or conference to another to discuss Brexit.  I thank my colleague, Deputy Declan Breathnach, for acknowledging the work done not only by the Government but also by all parties and Members of the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The circumstances in which we find ourselves are not of our making.  I am not sure those who advocated Brexit were sure of what they were fighting to achieve.  Nevertheless, we are in a difficult position and must deal with it.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Morrow appears to believe special status for Northern Ireland is included in the Good Friday Agreement.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement, for which the former Taoiseach, the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald was responsible, was a stepping stone to the Good Friday Agreement, which is a wonderful agreement.  The European Union should view Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland as a successful project.  It has provided billions of euro and acted as a driving force for peace.  While we are grateful to the United States and the United Kingdom, in many ways the European Union was the unsung hero of the peace process.  Our membership of it was very important and the Union underpinned many of the peace programmes of the past 20 years. <\/p> <p>  Dr. Morrow spoke about state visits.  I recall the Queen's highly significant visit to the Republic in 2011.  A remark was made that we had taken our relationship with the United Kingdom very casually before that time.  For example, despite the United Kingdom being our largest trading partner, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce was not established until 2011.  Ireland probably had joint chambers of commerce with France, Germany and other countries long before we had one with our biggest trading partner.  The Queen's visit broke down many barriers.  I was in the United Kingdom during the President's visit where I met many Irish people who expressed great pride.  My father was one of those who emigrated to the United Kingdom.  While I can understand the historical baggage involved in a presidential visit to the United Kingdom, why did it take so long for a President to visit Britain?  Will Dr. Morrow elaborate on his statement that Brexit could affect state visits? <\/p> <p>  I have heard a view expressed that Ireland may have to leave the European Union.  That is wishful thinking on the part of some of those who voted for Brexit.  It will not happen and should not be part of the discussion.  The European Union has been good to Ireland and we will remain a committed member.

While I have come to expect high standards from him, this is one of the most comprehensive documents I have read on Brexit.  It would be remiss of me not to express my appreciation of the outstanding work Dr. Morrow has done on various fronts over the years.  No one deserves more credit than he does for showing 24\/7 commitment to peace and reconciliation.  It is difficult to find a question to ask because the presentation covered so much ground.  Dr. Morrow has thrown a powerful spotlight on the issue of peace and reconciliation.  He is correct - I plead guilty in this regard - that we have all been panicking about the economic consequences of Brexit which are the primary issue for most people as they try to earn a living.  Other issues which some of us have raised intermittently are very much secondary and Dr. Morrow's work on the issue has pushed them much further up the agenda.<\/p> <p>  We squared the circle with the Good Friday Agreement.  My personal impression is that we achieved what was virtually impossible.  Many benefits and consequences have flowed from the Agreement, but the dilemma is that there has been a complete failure by a new generation of mainly conservative politicians in Britain to grasp the full extent of the peace agreement or settlement or the impact of Brexit on the North of Ireland, the Republic and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and, in the broader sense, the three strands of the Agreement.  In many ways, they are in total denial.  I echo Deputy Declan Breathnach's comment that they are not sure what is coming.  No one can be sure because the issue remains open. <\/p> <p>  My question is as much political as academic.  I was lucky to be able to ask two questions of the Brexit team as it is difficult to ask a single question of it.  One of my questions was on the subject on which Dr. Morrow focused, namely, how the issue of consent, the basis of the Good Friday Agreement, would be factored into Brexit.  I also asked if the United Kingdom would commit to ensuring consent would be a central issue.  The reply was gushing but the more gushing the reply on some of these issues, the less credible it is.  I have many chats in the corridors of Westminster, for want of a better description, and much of what I hear is wishful thinking that does not always stack up. <\/p> <p>  To return to the Good Friday Agreement, are gushing reassurances worth anything if the articles of the Good Friday Agreement are not being implemented, for example, if a cross-Border body, IntertradeIreland, is not allowed to function either because it breaks down or some of our Northern brethren do not allow it to function?  The problem is that we can discuss theory which is good at providing a backdrop and a framework in which to operate, but there is also a political dimension.  How do we persuade the British Government that there are issues for us when its concept of Brexit is largely confined to the south east of England and does not even extend to the north of England?<\/p><p>Therefore, how do we hold only what we have got?  How do we sustain the reconciliation we have got?  How do we sustain the bit of trust we have got out of the Good Friday Agreement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Alasdair McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489071600,"counter":1188,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions, which I will try to answer.  Personally, I think the gushing stuff is catastrophic because it is delaying us getting to the nub of the issue.  It would be better if, in a non-alarmist way, we were extremely matter of fact about the issues in regard to the Good Friday Agreement.  This is why I am suggesting that, in short order, somebody is asked to take six months to go through the issues and potential risks in detail, so these can be central to the debate.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about two things.  First, either Northern Ireland is collateral to Brexit and, therefore, is essentially ignored or, second, it is peripheral and is treated as a secondary issue, and it does not come up early enough.  My real concern is not to say this is necessarily going to be the worst of all possible worlds but that it is urgent that we get serious about what are the issues.   We need to drill down past reconciliation in general to those things which make for reconciliation, and consider what it would do if that strut is taken out.  There is now a real need to be serious and matter of fact about that and not gushy at all.  Everything gushy which tells me we are going to have a common travel area and it is all going to be fine strikes me as uncertain and, in fact, creates more uncertainty for all of us because it does not even give us the range of what we are negotiating.  I personally want it to move to being matter of fact so people can start speaking to me about what the real risks are.<\/p> <p>  Speaking personally, I think there is some evidence that the UK Government and the Conservative Party regard the agreement as an agreement for Ireland, not as a watershed in British-Irish relations - perhaps this is not fair as a whole, but that is my view.  Therefore, they see it as an external thing, not a hugely radical change in the way the United Kingdom relates to Ireland, which it is, in my view.  It is the most radical document that was ever produced and it has in many ways upended British-Irish relations from a fundamental default of enmity to a fundamental default of partnership.  If we have taken partnership out, then that has significant questions for all of us.  We cannot go on pretending that is not serious.  We have to work through what is the new partnership, how Ireland feels about being forced unilaterally into a renegotiation of these fundamental issues and how we are going to renegotiate these.  We have to get serious about that.<\/p> <p>  In practical terms, two weeks ago I was speaking at the Centre for Cross Border Studies conference and, prior to speaking, I met representatives of a number of community organisations which had worked along the Border.  I had a lot to do with this kind of work in terms of supporting community activity in the years while I was on the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council.  I heard about the implications for some of those people who had spent literally the last 15 to 20 years building up the things which had been really significant in their quality of life, for example, Protestants in County Cavan who felt they had been entirely isolated and who felt this agreement had opened things up with their neighbours and had created much freer circumstances for them.  It is not a one-way street.  What happens to those things?  Do these things matter in Brexit?  Are we going to maintain that intimate level between towns and villages such as Lifford and Strabane?  Speaking about Brexit when one is in Derry is quite a dramatic event because, essentially, one is putting back something which has been extremely important to people and which is family, because Inishowen is family, as is the Newry-Dundalk Border area.  These are human issues, not simply political decisions about economies.  They are real issues where real questions are reopened.  We have to be serious about all of that part too.<\/p> <p>  In regard to state visits, it is not so much state visits for me.   The issue that is really at hand is that, in all of the crises in Northern Ireland, the British and Irish Governments have been the necessary backdrop to the crisis by upholding the notion of partnership and that this will be fulfilled within the principles of the agreement.  I am very worried about any potential risk to that.  I am concerned that the need to assert independence from the European Union will make it more complicated in regard to allowing a EU state to be engaged directly inside Northern Ireland.  The importance of the British-Irish relationship to stability in the North and in the North-South relationship is not peripheral; it is central.  Therefore, changes in that diplomatic level really matter for us at a very specific level.<\/p> <p>  I have forgotten Senator Feighan's other question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Duncan Morrow"},{"type":"speech","time":1489071600,"counter":1189,"content":"<p>It was on the state visits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#F00300","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489071600,"counter":1190,"content":"<p>State visits are symbolic.  For example, in 2002 the devolved settlement effectively collapsed internally in Northern Ireland and it took five years for it to be resurrected in any form.  Essentially, British-Irish co-operation during that period, exactly as in the period of the framework documents and in the current period, was critical.  Therefore, anything which interrupts that is critical.  At times during the flags protest and during real tensions around significant issues, the changes in the British-Irish level have been evidence of change for us when it has been complicated inside Northern Ireland.  This is a complex agreement.  If Brexit has any effect on that, we need to know what it is about.<\/p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement was a comprehensive agreement.  We need to identify what has changed in the relationship between Britain and Ireland and what are the consequences of that for Northern Ireland.  Above all, it disables the Northern Ireland Executive.  The Northern Ireland Executive can agree some practical issues on Brexit but when it comes to the way in which it promotes those ideas, I believe that will become increasingly difficult to manage over the next two years and, in the end, that is the framework within which all of the comprehensive issues have to be agreed.  Those issues are not just economic and also involve questions of identity, citizenship, local relationships and security.  It does not do me any good to pretend that this blank box does not create uncertainty and resentment.<\/p> <p>  I will finish on an issue which is talked about in the press, so I am not pre-empting anything.  If, in the end, there is no deal and everybody walks away, if it is the hardest possible outcome, then, for Northern Ireland, that means the imposition of a hard border through an area in which 80% of the elected representatives are Nationalist.  How that is enforced, who enforces it, what it does to the police and what it does to the stability of the Northern Ireland settlement, I have no idea, and I am certainly not going to speculate.  However, what I am telling the committee is that it does not seem to me like a process that is leading us towards reconciliation; instead, it seems to be upping the ante.  It would be extremely important for somebody to see that in advance and to begin to get that at the centre of the negotiations.  This is certainly the case from the Northern side but it strikes me that, given Border communities suffered for years from economic marginalisation within Ireland, the return of a border which puts them back on the margins rather than in the centre is also a problem for the six Border counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Duncan Morrow"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489071600,"counter":1191,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Morrow for his presentation.

The people of my generation remember a hard border, and I am talking about the time before militarisation in 1969 and 1970.

Does he think those unanswered questions could be sorted out through the federalisation of the UK?<\/p><p> A retail analyst recently said on the radio that, for instance, Tesco Ireland can ship goods anywhere in the Thirty-two Counties at the moment but if Brexit resulted in a hard border, every product on the lorries would have to be itemised to establish where they were made.  That would make life impossible.  Therein lies part of the difficulty.<\/p><p> Dr. McDonnell referred to gushing responses.  I visit Westminster on a regular basis and speak to all the parties.  There is a deliberate desire not to understand the complexities of the situation in the Six Counties.  One only has to look at who has been sent to oversee the process - Mr. Brokenshire and Mr. Chris Hopkins.  I have not met Mr. Brokenshire but I have met Mr. Hopkins.  There is a total lack of understanding of the situation.  The fear for many of us is the North will be used as a bargaining chip in the Brexit negotiations or not properly considered and that we will not be very much an integral part of the negotiations because we had a First Minister who went against the democratic deficit apparent in the vote in the North.  We are not all in it together because, as Dr. McDonnell said, it is all about the south east of England; it is not about the North and farmers.  Jeffrey Donaldson was telling us before the referendum that he had spoken to George Osborne and it would all be hunky-dory.  Out of every &pound;100 small farmers in my constituency get, &pound;87 comes from Europe.  That will all be replaced.  George Osborne is no longer in office and we have no guarantees.  It is a big issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mickey Brady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489071600,"counter":1193,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Morrow for his detailed paper.  As Dr. McDonnell said, he laid out the huge issues facing the entire island and the EU.  He mentioned the community groups he met at the cross-Border study centre.  I have witnessed the impact of Brexit, particularly on SMEs in the Border region, because of currency fluctuation.  That uncertainty has kicked in.  I attended a conference recently where an economist said we had time to prepare for Brexit but we do not.  It has had an adverse impact already.  People who had plans for expansion in the agrifood sector in my area have put them on the back burner because of the uncertainty rewarding trading arrangements and currency fluctuation.<\/p> <p>  The Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Northern Ireland Minister of Finance, Mr. O'Muilleoir, appeared before the committee to discuss funding for INTERREG or PEACE programme cross-Border studies and so on, and, along with other committee members, I made the point that there is a significant lead-in period for these programmes and a great deal of preparatory work needs to be done by applicants, be they community groups or statutory agencies at local level.  The lack of knowledge and the uncertainty about funding for these programmes post-2020 has knocked the morale and the stuffing out of some community groups that should now be conducting feasibility studies and preparatory work and that is a problem.  Dr. Morrow referred to a good study on the potential implications for communities throughout the North and the need to have a better message about longevity and an assurance about continued funding from Europe and both Governments.  The INTERREG and PEACE programmes are 85% funded by Europe with the remaining 15% provided by the national Governments.  Damage has been done in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Morrow said the Agreement will be discarded.  It is most unfortunate that the importance and the centrality of the Agreement did not feature more in the referendum debate, which was more about pounds, shillings and pence.  Who is not guilty of going that road?  There is more concern and awareness about this than there was a year ago.  First Vice-President of the Commission, Mr. Timmermans, attended a joint sitting of this committee and the European affairs and foreign affairs committees and, in fairness to him, he made strong statements about his understanding of the importance of the Agreement.  He said it was an iconic agreement of which the EU should be proud given it played an important role in it and it is also an international agreement lodged with the UN.  It will be frightening for democracies if an agreement lodged with the UN, which was voted for overwhelmingly throughout the island - 94% in the Republic and more than 70% in Northern Ireland - is discarded.  That was the first time we had the opportunity to vote on one question on the one day since 1918.  Surely there is huge merit in us advocating the importance of the Agreement and the fact that it was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people with the two sovereign Governments as co-guarantors and that it was lodged with the UN.  We probably have to focus more to that and ensure it is not discarded.  The comments of Vice-President Timmermans were some of the best I have heard from any person outside the island regarding the Agreement.  Mr. Hilary Benn and some of his colleagues understood the importance of it when they appeared before the committee.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Morrow mentioned the civic element of public life in Northern Ireland but, regrettably, the civic forum was not re-established.  The current and previous chairmen of this committee have made a huge effort to invite groups before it from Northern Ireland that believed they had nobody representing them and they were given a forum here.  I am sure they will continue to be given that.  Dr. Morrow has presented an exceptionally good paper.  Many issues have to be of concern to us.  It is not easy for us to provide the answers.  We can outline what lines cannot be crossed.  I am delighted he has focused strongly on the importance of ensuring the Agreement is not diminished in any way.  During the previous D&aacute;il, Senator Feighan was the chairman of the committee and Dr. McDonnell and Mr. Brady were in attendance at meetings where we highlighted the fact that the potential of the Agreement was not being maximised.  Now we are trying to batten down the hatches and retain what we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#G00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1489071600,"counter":1194,"content":"<p>I referred to the process of civil society dialogue and the various fora and sectors feeding into it.

The clear message from the two officers I have referred to was that they want to see us coming up with practical solutions.  We have got to move to that phase fairly quickly.

We need to move into that phase.  We will obviously meet a lot of opposition from the British Government.  However, I think it would be true to say that they have never experienced anything like the number of people who are visiting in delegations North and South, putting their case.  They seem to be very keyed-in on the issue of peace and the importance of the Good Friday Agreement but they want the practical solutions. <\/p><p> In terms of what Dr. Morrow said earlier about the process of the reconciliation issue and the impact on communities, we are all talking about the business sector.

To answer Deputy Brendan Smith, the issue at the heart of this is that the Brexit discussion was largely carried out on an economic basis but it goes to the heart of relationships and fundamental relationships are critical to creating stability around which economics can happen.  My concern in terms of the Good Friday Agreement is that we have not been serious about examining what damage could be done to relationships.  The experience of fragile political communities throughout Northern Ireland, which is nothing if not a fragile political community, is that \"Events, dear boy, events\" are what cause the damage, particularly if taken by surprise by these things.  These things move at a remarkable speed once they start to escalate.  Nobody wants it.  It is extremely clear nobody wishes it.  What worries me is that if we do not pay attention to it, it will catch us unawares.  All of a sudden there will be a border, and people will react in different ways to that or discussions will be conducted under very extreme circumstances.  We need to get ahead of this now, stop the gushy language that has been mentioned and instead become really quite serious about this.<\/p> <p>  To be quite serious about it, what are the consequences of a hard border?  It may be able to negotiate an alternative to a hard border.  However, one potential scenario might be that there is a very highly policed frontier, precisely where a hard policing frontier is what is resisted by the population.  Another possibility is it is not policed, it is abandoned and so becomes a kind of smuggling zone, an area of lawlessness.  Neither of those are desirable from anybody's point of view.  What are we putting in place as an alternative to these two scenarios that would make sense in terms of identity?  It is not just about whether Ireland needs to come up with solutions.  It is urgently important as part of Brexit that the nature of that Border is discussed in order to avoid those potential consequences, not just to talk about freedom of movement of goods.  It is very important, particularly to the communities living beside that Border.  <\/p> <p>  While I do not have the exact number of people who commute daily to do some or all of their business in the other jurisdiction, in Donegal, in Derry, in Louth, in south Down and so on, there is certainly a kind of integrated economy which moves across that Border.  What happens to those specific areas and the communities in them?  That community dimension at first instance is economic but the outrage about it becomes non-economic and turns into a political grievance.  There is no simple boundary between the economic and the grievance.  The critical thing is that this does not become another ground for grievance.  Northern Ireland was historically described as the factory of grievances.  We have done quite a lot of work trying to avoid and reverse that.  I want to make sure that any potential for that is headed off early rather than too late, because trying to deal with it once the horse has bolted is worse.  <\/p> <p>  There are two elements to that.  One is that it should not to be added on at the end with deliberate ignorance, as was mentioned earlier.  I do not know if that is true but what I do know is that we cannot afford it to be such ignorance.  I am concerned that the fear of Brexit in Northern Ireland, for which is there is no consensus, will prevent solutions to this issue emerging in time or at all.  Those of us who see this as potentially occurring need it identified and somehow put onto the table in a way that people can begin to practically move forward on it.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the importance of the European Union, I very much hope that it is a central element of what the EU does.  The European Union will maintain a citizenship interest in Northern Ireland potentially for all of its citizens after Brexit.  Potentially every single person born in Northern Ireland will remain an EU citizen.  The EU does not, any more than Ireland, actually exit the citizenship protection rights on that part of the territory.  I am not sure that the legal, constitutional and civic implications of that have been fully worked through.  What does that mean?  Does the European Union, through Ireland, have a specific interest in protecting its citizens in Northern Ireland or does it not?  What would be the case if there were a hard border scenario with British, Irish or both in a hard border?  I agree it is potentially exaggerated.  Everybody just says no, it will not happen, which is exactly what I do not want to hear.  It is not that I hope that it does happen; it is that I think we need to look at what happens in different circumstances in a more matter of fact way.  It could potentially be necessary to obtain a visa on an Irish passport if one is travelling from Dublin Airport to one's home in south Down.  That is an absurd scenario and it will not occur but I do not want that exploited by people who start talking about fears.  I absolutely think we need to have it named and we have to get it off the table.  We have to name it not to put it on the table but to get it off the table, because it is in the practical, at the community level and at Northern Ireland level, that this starts to fuel the factory of grievances.  It is in the practical that we have to be serious about it.  <\/p> <p>  Today is an opportunity for me to say the implications for reconciliation are very important.  It is not a question of trying to be alarmist or trying to exaggerate.  It is a question of trying to say that unless we begin to imagine what the potential issues are, they will creep up on us, they will catch us unawares and they will be serious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2017030900002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Duncan Morrow"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489071600,"counter":1197,"content":"<p>Deputy Breathnach raised a point as to what Britain wants or defining what Britain wants.  For the benefit of colleagues, my interpretation of what Britain wants, which I have tried very hard to figure out, is that it wants to maximise the benefits of an association with the European Union but not to have any financial or legal responsibility or accountability.  Britain wants to escape its financial and legal responsibility but wants to try to retain the benefits.  It is in that context that we have to get our heads around this, both in this committee and everywhere else, in Northern Ireland, in the Republic or wherever.

When the Housing Agency appeared before us a few weeks ago, one of the issues that arose was progressing the purchasing of the vacant bank properties with funding of &euro;70 million to the Housing Agency.  We understand that between AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, there is somewhere in the region of 1,100 properties available for purchase.  We know contracts have been or are about to be signed for about 217 properties.  How many of the 1,100 properties are not suitable due to location or size and how many are under active consideration?  Is there any concern that the way in which this financing is structured whereby it rolls over after the tranche is bought and sold on could result in the loss of any of those properties?  Mr. McCarthy might not be able to answer my next question.  I have had a look through the three schemes that are up and running under this heading and, on the basis of the information we got from the County and City Management Association and others previously, have tried to calculate what the total amount of units on the basis on what has been announced to date would deliver over six years.  I have come up with a figure of about 6,400 or 6,500 units between the &euro;70 million and the other figures.

I still firmly believe that it is time to consider moving signing off on all certification to local authorities for matters like fire and disability compliance.

I would be equally concerned about whether we even know how many construction drawings are being submitted before builders go to site.  Planning permission drawings are frequently converted into construction drawings almost overnight.  We know there are complications with vacant properties.  Some are old while there are heritage or compliance issues with others.  That is my major concern in respect of vacant properties.

That will come to us in the first half of April so we just want to proof the final version of the strategy against that.  Broadly speaking, we are talking about the second half of April.<\/p> <p>  There are two elements to the Housing Agency acquisitions.  In overall terms, there is a &euro;70 million fund available but it is designed to be a revolving fund.  After the units are initially purchased by the Housing Agency, they are sold onwards to approved housing bodies.  The most up-to-date picture from the Housing Agency is that it has signed contracts on 238 units.  Sales on 82 of those units are closed.  Bids have been submitted on a further 98 units.  The Housing Agency is looking at further properties all of the time.  The important thing is that as well as moving ahead with those purchases, the Housing Agency is moving ahead with the onwards sales to approved housing bodies.  At this point in time, it has earmarked 151 of the units for which it has signed contracts for onward transfer to two approved housing bodies so it has already identified the onward purchasers for nearly half of what it has got in the system.  The critical part is that it gets money back into the system, which will allow the Housing Agency to get on with further purchases.

For the repair and leasing scheme, there is a target of 3,500 units in that time.  Ten days ago the Minister announced that we would be accelerating early delivery to a minimum of 800 units this year.  The other significant scheme is the buy and renew scheme.  Our initial aim is to handle 400 to 500 units this year and next.  Extrapolating forward leaves one with something in the order of 1,500 to 2,000 units over the lifetime of the programme.  In the pilot exercise that has been under way in counties Waterford and Carlow it has been found that some property owners are interested in making their units available for housing but not under the repair and leasing scheme.

In the past three years we have invested a significant amount of funds in dealing with voids across the country.  This will probably be the last year of a significant voids programme, given that we have broken the back of the issue.  I spoke to a local authority director of housing recently who indicated that the authority had between 40 and 50 vacant units out of a stock of more than 6,000.  In many cases, the vacancy rate is below 1%.  As part of the normal reletting process, when old tenancies end and new ones start, this would not be out of line with international experience.  In the past three years we have invested approximately &euro;84 million in a voids programme.  This relates to Deputy Pat Casey's point on early wins, in that capital constrained local authorities were not in a position to bring units back into use early.  The figure &euro;84 million has delivered approximately 7,000 units.  It was a critical early target and area of activity for us.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Pat Casey raised two issues about building regulations.  If it helps him, we will be happy to brief him on the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, and the new building control management system, BCMS, under which there is a well developed online system for the registering and lodging of documents the whole way through the process.  Instead of delaying the meeting, we could have a separate chat about that issue.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's second point is one on which we are working, namely, older buildings and the extent to which we can match their deeper retrofit requirements with the modern regulatory system of fire and building controls.  For the next few months we will be working with Dublin City Council as part of the living city initiative in an attempt to use some Georgian properties as a test bed to determine the challenges that arise and whether we can marry the regulatory requirements with the specific requirements of older buildings.  This work will cover the regulatory system, not just building controls but also planning, and allow us to determine the factors involved.  If a product emerges from this process that suggests changes to the regulatory system are required, the Minister has stated he is opening to considering them.<\/p> <p>  On the question of who owns vacant properties, the repair and leasing pilot scheme has shown us that making information on the availability of the schemes public can be useful.  It attracts people to the scheme, as well as the buy and renew scheme.  Obviously, one could tap into the property register or other mechanisms to identify ownership, but, as we accelerate the roll-out of the repair and leasing scheme, we are looking for local authorities to invite expressions of interest.  Some have already done this ahead of the national roll-out.  For example, a number of Dublin local authorities have been putting out feelers out.  The ownership question will not present a problem in reaching the figure of 800 units this year, but we will consider the matter in the light of the feedback under the vacant housing reuse strategy.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kate O'Connell mentioned the overall housing supply problem.  We try to look as far back into the pipeline as we can by examining a number of indicators.  Furthest back in the pipeline is the number of planning permissions.  We publish a number of statistics in a monthly report.  We will publish the statistics for February in the coming days, but the statistics for January show that the number of units for which planning permission was granted in the 12 months to the end of September last year was an increase of approximately 45% on the figure for the previous 12 months.  That is a strong signal.  Through the BCMS, we monitor commencement notices which need to be filed on the electronic system as developments commence.  Up to the end of December, the number of units covered by commencement notices had increased by 51% year on year.  That is a significant increase in activity commencing.  We use ESB connections as a proxy for completions.  The figure for the calendar year 2016 was just below 15,000, a significant increase on the figure for the previous year of 12,666.<\/p> <p>  In overall terms, our objective under Rebuilding Ireland is to reach the point where we will have a housing supply of approximately 25,000 units per annum.  We started in 2015, when the number of completions was 12,666.  As such, Rebuilding Ireland will require us to double housing output.  The completions figure for 2016 was a significant first step along that road.  Given the extent to which there are commencements and planning permission is applied for and granted, there is a pipeline.  How the housing market will evolve in the coming period is subject to many factors, but there are positive signs in the level of activity as measured by these indices.<\/p><p>What I have to say is more of an observation rather than a question.  Unless something changes dramatically in the plan that is to be announced in April, what we are looking at is 6,000 units being delivered over six years under the three programmes.  That is 3% of the total vacant stock that exists, according to the census, 198,000 properties.  It is a really small target.  We hear of bigger targets such as 25,000 overall builds and 47,000 social builds of various kinds but this is the low-hanging fruit.  Notwithstanding the difficulties in identifying properties and dealing with issues concerning owners, probate and other issues, even if it is 10% or 15% of the 198,000 properties there is a significant number of units to be got, but it is also significantly cheaper.  The upfront payment for repair and lease properties, on average, is &euro;40,000 and that is recouped from rent.  It costs up to &euro;100,000 for the buy and renew scheme.  While we do not have the figures for purchases, one would presume, in particular if one was block buying, that one would get some discount.  Hopefully, one would be purchasing properties at below &euro;200,000 if they are in that kind of ballpark.  Therefore, I question the target of 6,600, or 3%.  A 10% or 15% target out of 198,000 is modest.  Is that it?  Will there be any attempt in the strategy to go beyond the target?<\/p><p> We support rapid builds.  We understand the logic of them.  We have done a lot of work on the ground in the constituencies to make sure people understand what they are for but, again, according to the press release from the Minister, they are &euro;245,000 a unit.  On the basis of the ones in Clondalkin the total amount of money and the total number of units, the unit price breaks down at &euro;245,000.  Is the Department going to revise the plan?  Do the witnesses know if the Minister intends to revise the plan because they are good schemes?  I am a strong supporter of the three schemes but if they are underfunded to the current extent we will not get the return we could get, and a much more quick and cost-effective return than through other aspects of the plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017030900002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1227,"content":"<p>Are there any other questions on Pillar 5 before I go back to Mr. McCarthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017030900002#L00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489068000,"counter":1228,"content":"<p>The Minister has said fairly consistently that Rebuilding Ireland is a plan for the period up to 2021, and one of the things I have said consistently is about the need to be agile.

The Minister has said clearly that we need to be agile and we need to keep our experience and activity under review.  The repair and leasing and the buy and renew schemes are in the early stages and we will certainly look at the progress we make under them.  If there is greater potential there, that is something we will look at.

As O'Devaney Gardens is probably going to be the first location where we will have something like this, could we get an update on that?  I am specifically interested in three things: if and when it is going to happen; who is going to be responsible for the units - because I have a very strong view, which I will come back to depending on the answer I get; but also what is the financing of this.  Will affordability be determined by a percentage of market rent for example, or will it be determined by the cost of paying down the loans and some management and maintenance of the unit that is being rented because they are two very different models of cost rental that would have a very different impact on the amount of money that a family would have to pay?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017030900002#L01500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1240,"content":"<p>I have three issues I wish to raise.

We are trying to use O'Devaney as a test bed or a model to learn lessons and then roll it out more generally.<\/p><p> In respect of 4.12, there are different elements of work on publicly owned lands.  By the end of this month, we hope to have a web-based system in place that will show in overall terms the lands nationally that are zoned for residential use, all the lands owned by local authorities and the land aggregation scheme sites that are available for housing.  We will also have the first outputs from work we are doing with the broader State agency family in respect of lands it has that are potentially suitable for housing.  We hope to have that by the end of the month.  We will then bring further land activities on stream in the following months, one of which is the potential to use some for student housing.  We will also map our social housing pipeline of 504 projects as published to create a land for housing web-based system.  It will be possible to add layers to show zoning, social housing projects and, starting with the greater Dublin area, we want to see the active private housing sites of ten units or more.

Is the RTB actively looking at that kind of location because Waterford city is an example of a place where, if one sticks to the local electoral area model, nobody will benefit despite the fact that significant numbers of people need to benefit.<\/p> <p>  On the affordable rental model, I would be very worried if the conversations about this are about the value extracted from the land because my understanding from the conversation with Dublin City Council was that it had more to do with the private units in the development overall.  There is a separate conversation to be had about the rent the affordable renter pays.  Nobody seems to be clear whether it is a percentage of market rent or if it will be to cover the cost of pay down of the loans.  That is an important distinction.  Mr. McCarthy may not have the answer but is he considering both models or are there other models?  <\/p> <p>  I am concerned about value extracted for the land because the Housing Agency is doing a study of the all-in cost of building, presumably to make policy recommendations to the Government on how to reduce the cost of producing private sector units.  In advance of that report, if it is the intention of the Department and Dublin City Council management to, for example, offset the cost of the purchase price of the land to reduce the affordability of the private sector units, that is a very big subsidy by the taxpayer towards private for purchase units.  I am not necessarily arguing against using public money for that purpose but given that there are so many families in emergency accommodation and there is such a low level of investment in the vacant properties, is that really the best use of that public good now?  Would it not be better to wait until the Housing Agency report is ready because it might have better suggestions on how to reduce the cost of the private sector units? <\/p> <p>  To lay my cards on the table, if the Department comes to the South Dublin County Council area with that particular proposal for The Grange, it will meet huge resistance from me and people in the council.  Even if it is a good model for O'Devaney, which I do not think it is, it is definitely not a good model in Fingal where the council would need the purchase price of the land to buy other land.  The same is true in Clondalkin.  <\/p> <p>  If I understood Mr. McCarthy correctly, if he is suggesting the use of public lands for private investment student accommodation, how does the Department guarantee affordability?  There is on-campus student accommodation in several universities which is close to market rent.  I strongly supported the change in the legislation for the Housing Finance Agency loans to universities but it is one thing to have the land and the capital to invest but how can the Department ensure that is affordable, particularly for students from a lower income background?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017030900002#M00900","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489068000,"counter":1253,"content":"<p>The Housing Agency work will have been completed before the modelling for affordable rental, using O'Devaney Gardens, and before it gets to procurement stage.<\/p><p>The modelling needs to be done even before it gets to procurement.  The Housing Agency work will have been completed at that stage.  While the Housing Agency work is being done, we are trying to progress the modelling to a point that we have something to work with and we can take into account the findings of the Housing Agency study at that stage.  I do not think one prejudices the other.<\/p><p> In terms of the use of a public asset, this depends to some extent on the size of a site.  In many cases we have public lands and we will engage with the local authority about doing an exclusively social housing development with 40, 50, 60 or, in certain circumstances, even slightly more.  On a site such as O'Devaney Gardens, which may accommodate 600 units, we need a more mixed-tenure model.  It is not that it is either one or the other.  There will be a social housing piece and a private housing piece within that.  We will try to work in the new approach to affordable rental and try to get a return for the public good with lower rents.  At this point I do not know how those lower rents will be determined because it will be influenced by the outcome of the modelling we will be undertaking with Dublin City Council and possibly with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund as well.  Our overall objective on any of these sites is to try to ensure that we get the best outcome for the public good, purely through social housing in some circumstances and, in others, through larger but more mixed-tenure sustainable developments that try to encompass an affordable rental element as well.<\/p><p> There is considerable private development of student accommodation, but there is also a significant amount of activity either going on or planned by the higher education institutes.  The next step on public lands that may have potential for student accommodation would be engagement with the higher education institutes and the Department of Education and Skills on their role.  It is not necessary that it would automatically go into the private space.  Rebuilding Ireland makes a commitment for the Department of Education and Skills to complete an overall student strategy in the second quarter of this year.

That value-for-money exercise must determine that the prices that come in for delivery of those units are better value for money than the traditional means of undertaking the same piece of work.

Unusually, this PPP is not just for design and build but also for the management and maintenance of the stock for 25 years which, I understand, has never been done previously in social housing delivery.<\/p> <p>  Has the value-for-money exercise been concluded?  Does the Department know what it would cost to design, build, manage and maintain for 25 years relative to the traditional delivery of social housing?  I presume if the Department has it concluded and has an answer to that question, Mr. McCarthy will not reveal it to us because the information is commercially sensitive.  How will elected members in local authorities be able to determine whether this is a good use of taxpayers' money?  I would have thought that the 25-year management and maintenance element of the cost, which the value-for-money exercise has to compare with the tender, will form a very big part of it.<\/p> <p>  What stage has the Department reached with that?  How will it be able to share that information with elected members of local authorities in order to allow them to scrutinise the process properly?  Why did the Department decide to include a 25-year management-and-maintenance element rather than just a PPP for design and build?  I would have thought the Department would get good value for money with a PPP for design and build for 500 units.  It could come well below the current &euro;180,000 per unit for standard infill projects based on the Department's figures.  I have a concern on that.<\/p> <p>  On a related topic, I said earlier that I was very surprised by the Minister's press release a couple of weeks ago on the two rapid-build projects being proposed for south Dublin County Council, both of which, I am pleased to say, have the Part 8 approval.  However, on the basis of the figures in the Minister's press release, they will cost &euro;245,000 per unit.  A couple of months ago I got an answer from the Department indicating that the average cost over the past two years of providing a standard local authority new build is on average &euro;180,000.  Why will these rapid-build units cost &euro;245,000 if that figure is correct?  Unless something is built into the overall costs that I am not seeing, that is substantially higher than the &euro;210,000 or so that we are told the Poppintree units cost.  None of this is an argument against rapid-build housing.  I am absolutely in favour of speedy delivery of good-quality units.  I am concerned about the value-for-money element of the PPPs and I am very concerned about the cost of the rapid-build housing units.

Let us do something good and stop any abuse by other means.  I worked on a project which qualified for the research and development tax credit and it is not as easy as the Deputy might think to reassess and resubmit for the scheme.  It is difficult to qualify and, provided the criteria are sufficiently tight and rigorous, abuses should be prevented.  Repeat inventions do not qualify and submitting the same thing again with a few tweaks is not sufficient to be rare, non-obvious or novel.

We will move through this and some of the other amendments that cover some of the same ground.  There is no doubt that we need to encourage innovation.  We should support innovators.  I am not convinced that giving tax breaks to companies is the best way to support innovation, which is why I opposed the Bill in the first instance.  Every cent lost in tax revenue is money that could potentially be going to the universities.<\/p> <p>  We have a choice.  Do we go the private route in supporting and encouraging innovation or do we take the public route?  We could even provide grants to small producers, which might be more helpful to them.  The biggest problem for small operations or individuals trying to develop something new is not tax but having a bit of money to do the research and development and develop an idea rather than a tax break on the revenue they generate once they have it up and running.  My fear is that this is not the best way to achieve the Bill's stated objective.  The unintended - possibly intended - consequence is providing another mechanism for profitable corporations to pay less tax.  Obviously, there is a context for that because big questions arise regarding the extent of the tax being paid by corporations.  Even people who might disagree with my perspective on these would accept that there are questions to be answered following the Apple case.  Just looking at the revenue figures of corporation tax take as against pre-tax profits, dividing one by the other does not give 12.5%, but about 6%.  That is the effective rate of tax being paid at the moment.  As we know, for some companies it is considerably less because most domestic small and medium-sized enterprises are paying 12.5%.  If the average is 6%, it means that a small number of very profitable companies are paying very little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#J00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1333,"content":"<p>The office referred to in the Bill only looks at the criteria for patentability.

There is the PTRLA, the funding for researchers in universities.  A lot of that is on the other end of it as well.  I have met many of them throughout the country and the last thing on their mind is whether they will get a tax break out of this.  They are already being funded to do the research developments in 12 dedicated research centres throughout the country and in universities.  I know that is not totally relevant to what the Deputy is saying.<\/p> <p>  Inevitably, some of those people when they leave university start to develop something themselves.

One of the things that would happen is that Revenue would examine this matter through tax queries.  The responsibility would fall to Revenue.  This is only my view but if that were to be the case - I cannot say that it will not be the case - and if a bigger company set up smaller subsidiaries or companies and they encouraged employment, productivity and a turnover, it would be very difficult for anyone in government to say he or she thinks this big company is setting up a couple of minnows so that it can claim tax.  All that the Government and the Department could do on that would be to make sure that all relevant documentation and monetary evaluation of the larger company, and the smaller companies associated with it, would be dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  This legislation is due to be debated again on 29 March by which time Deputy Boyd Barrett may have tabled an amendment on this matter.  The Revenue Commissioners can examine this matter through transfer pricing.  Under EU legislation transfer pricing is illegal.  It would be difficult under the present EU legislation for companies to do as the Deputy has suggested.  I am not saying it is impossible, knowing how some companies could react.  There is sufficient EU legislation to deal with this matter.  There are measures associated with Revenue and the EU.  We should be careful about this matter.  How would we examine a mother company that may have set up three or four SMEs or three smaller companies to maybe benefit the mother company?  Where would be bring in legislation to counteract such activity?  How can we stop this happening if it is inevitable that these companies were going to create jobs and generate a turnover every year that would benefit an economy?<\/p><p>I take the point, but I do not know how this could be dealt with legally.

Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith and Richard Boyd Barrett propose to specify in the Bill a number of additional reporting requirements.  Section 18(2) provides that the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on activities under the KDB certification scheme will include information on such matters as the Minister may direct.  In addition, section 18(4)(h) provides for a wide-ranging and catch-all provision which permits the Minister to request the inclusion of such other statistical information as he or she prescribes.  I am satisfied that the combination of these two catch-all provisions neatly provides a sound basis for the Minister to request the inclusion in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of statistical information in a format he or she may decide.<\/p><p>For example, this could include the type of information that the Deputies have an interest in such as statistics on the breakdown of the knowledge development box, KDB, applications on a geographical or sectoral basis.  I refer here to any part of the State.  It has the benefit of providing the Minister with the ability to seek statistical information on whatever basis he or she sees fit.  I believe there is an inherent danger in being overly prescriptive in legislation.  Good legislation would provide a sound basis for ensuring that the Minister gets the information he or she wants at a particular point in time and at any time, rather than adopting an overly prescriptive approach in the content of the actual KDB report.  In my view it should be allowed to evolve in response to emerging developments and to be able to respond to new requirements.  The Bill provides a sound basis for this.  I assure Deputies that it has been the practice of the Comptroller and Auditor General, in this annual report on the activities of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, to provide a very rich account of activities and to include statistics, county by county.  This is in line with providing good customer service where flexibility is a key response to changing requirements.  In other words, throughout all of this the Minister and his Department can intervene, can continuously get reports on how this scheme is operating and can make interventions based on the information he or she will require, for the benefit of the taxpayer and to ensure all the points made by Deputy Boyd-Barrett are adhered to and that there is no abuse of the scheme.  It would be a folly on any Minister not to do that and have these measures in place.  I know the Deputy opposes the Bill in its entirety but this was specifically put in to address the points raised by the Deputy.  What would we do otherwise; do we set up a forum or a committee? We must have some faith in the Comptroller and Auditor General.  All of this still comes back to the Minister's office which, at any stage, has the right to check and go through the process county by county if needed to see that legislation is being adhered to.  If I was sitting in opposition I would look at this as being very reasonable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#L03300","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1393,"content":"<p>I will not labour the point I have made.  I thank Deputy Rock for endorsing the spirit of the amendments.  While I have no doubt about how conscientious the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan might be in these matters, future Ministers may not be so conscientious.  It is helpful for the Minister to have information that breaks down who it is that benefits from a particular measure or from the tax benefit for these companies.  It would be helpful if Ministers, others who are not Ministers and for the public to have access to that information so they can assess whether they think this is a good measure and whether the tax benefits conferred are value for money for the public, as against the value of other measures.<\/p> <p>  The area of corporate tax is, to put it mildly, opaque.  There are a lot of tax breaks out there.  I know that pertains to Revenue but when one gets this certificate then one is going to get the tax break and the two things are connected.  I do not have the figures to hand but it is worth saying, and I said it on Second Stage, gross pre-tax profits in Ireland for corporations are in the region of &euro;95 billion.  By the time we take out all the allowable allowances, deductions and tax breaks, the &euro;95 billion goes down to around &euro;65 billion in taxable income.  That is in the region of &euro;30 billion to &euro;40 billion worth of loopholes, tax breaks, incentives, deductions, allowances or whatever one wants to call them.

It might be useful to remind Deputies of the intention behind the Bill.  It is the introduction of the KDB certification scheme for SMEs to be administered by the Patents Office.  The process before the office involves the examination of the application to ensure that the invention the subject of the application meets the criteria of being novel, non-obvious and useful.  If an application meets these criteria, the office will grant a certificate.  If not, it will not issue one.  The certificate provides the gateway for small to medium enterprises to apply for the 6.25% corporate tax rate on profits arising from the invention.  The grant of the certificate does not, however, guarantee that an SME will qualify for the lower rate of corporation tax.  I am saying all this because I did not get an opportunity to say it in the D&aacute;il.  Revenue will consider tax returns on the basis of the provisions applying to the KDB scheme, which was introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act 2015 and which came into effect in January 2016.  Revenue will always have the ability to obtain necessary information on the KDB in order to provide reliable information in return to the Government, particularly the Department of Finance, on the use of the KDB, including information on revenue foregone by the Exchequer.  That is very interesting.<\/p><p>I understand the Deputies' desire to ensure monitoring and evaluation of the existing schemes in the research, enterprise and taxation areas.  It is, of course, necessary to protect taxpayers' money to ensure that the new schemes introduced provide the State with value for money, as they must.  I assure the Deputies that the process of monitoring and evaluation of all research, enterprise and taxation is ongoing and regularly reviewed.  In the case of the KDB scheme, I remind Deputies that the reports on tax expenditure published with the budget in 2015 provided an <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation of the KDB.  That evaluation outlined the basis for the best estimate of tax foregone of &euro;50 million.  This &euro;50 million is in respect of all aspects of the KDB, not just certification.<\/p><p>To answer one of the questions on monitoring and evaluating and the opportunity for Deputies such as those opposite to carry out an analysis of the scheme, the annual Estimates allow that.  That, as far as I know, is correct, is it not?  Any Deputy in the House may, during the Estimates process, bring an evaluation or assessment of the scheme before the D&aacute;il based on the information that has been given.  The information comes from the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Minister, who is obliged to provide it.  It would be folly for any Minister to provide wrong information because he would be failing to provide the proper information accredited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As such, there is an opportunity in the D&aacute;il to, as each Deputy sees fit, evaluate how the scheme has worked in all its aspects including tax credits, small to medium businesses and large business.  It is open for any Deputy to do that in the D&aacute;il, particularly in the context of matters relating to the portfolio of the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#N00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1409,"content":"<p>A great deal of this is onerous and would be difficult to establish effectively.  Much of what is being asked for is already done by the Department of Finance in the form of budgets and technical papers.  I am of the view that a lot of it is covered and we must be careful not to create unnecessary red tape.  When one looks at amendment No. 8 and the obligation it would impose on companies to list any past or previous grants, subsidies, tax incentives or research supports, one sees how that would become tremendously onerous.  It is not entirely clear if it would be a positive that a company succeeded in obtaining these things in the past or whether it would be a negative in the context of its application.  If we put it all in the full context of where the economy stands, companies with research and development departments increased employment between 2000 and 2014 by 101% in the service sector.  In effect, they doubled the level of employment whereas the employment rate among manufacturing firms that were not actively engaged in research and development was down by 72%.  There is a clear divergence which is the full context for the Bill and the thrust of its provisions.  While I appreciate the points being put forward, an onerous burden and a great deal of red tape are being proposed.

If a new product works well and one has done one's due diligence, one starts manufacturing it and one goes from there.  I agree with the Minister of State on this.  Much of the language used in the amendments is vague.  There is a proposal to include the cost to date to the Exchequer of revenues foregone.  The opposite side of the argument is that many of these companies might not have invested if they had not received a tax break to mitigate the risk of investing to get these off the ground.  That language is vague and there is an argument that they might not have come in had they not had the tax break.  I understand Deputy Boyd Barrett is asking how much money is foregone if they are not charged 12.5%, but they might not come in at all if they do not have the KDB  break.  That is the issue with that.  Another issue is the language on an impact on the delivery of an effective tax rate.  Is that Deputy Boyd Barrett's interpretation of an effective tax rate?  There is also an issue with the language relating to appropriate annual information.  What constitutes such information?  That has not been defined.  The Minister of State has explained that the Comptroller and Auditor General can provide the information we have anyway, but the language around a great deal of this is vague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#N00700","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1414,"content":"<p>Obviously, we disagree on these things.  I will not labour the point, but will make my final intervention on the group of amendments.  In direct response to the last point, I note that the Bill is supposed to deal specifically with small and medium enterprises.  It is not supposed to give rise to a debate about foreign direct investment.  As such, that particular argument does not hold.<\/p><p>Ironically, it might be relevant if some of my other questions are not addressed adequately.  Could this measure be abused by companies that are not supposed to benefit?  Under its own terms, the Bill is not supposed to be about foreign direct investment but about extending tax breaks to encourage domestic SMEs.<\/p><p> On the issue of information already available from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the amendments are trying to achieve an intersection of various Departments or State aids for companies that link together.  The Bill is from the Minister of State's Department, but its subject matter also involves Revenue and possibly other Departments that are supporting companies.  We will not fully understand how much of a benefit may be conferred on particular companies, how much public money will be expended and whether we will receive any benefit in return unless we have the whole rather than a fragmented picture.  The amendments in this series try to ensure we would have the full picture.<\/p><p> In terms of revenue forgone, come on.  Surely I only have to say the words \"Apple\" and \"section 110\".  Regardless of what the Minister of State thinks about this or which side he takes - we take different sides on these matters - all sides agree that section 110 was abused.  The information was not available or scrutinised.  It was not transparent enough to allow people to know that the vulture funds which had many property assets were paying no tax at all.  We only found out after the fact.  We still do not know how much tax was forgone because of section 110, but the estimates run into billions of euro.  This is serious stuff.  To my mind, it is a minimum requirement that we know how much tax will be forgone under a measure such as this in order that we can monitor the position.  I am unsure as to whether the Minister cited an estimate on Second Stage.  Does the Minster of State have a projected estimate of how much tax will be forgone in the first year or over time?  If he does, we will need to test it against the actuality as time passes.  If we find that the figure balloons beyond the estimated amount, it might be evidence of major abuse.  It is critical that we have this level of oversight, reporting and monitoring of such tax breaks.  I have argued strongly that the Committee on Budget Scrutiny should examine every subhead under the corporate tax heading through which tax liability is reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#N00800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1416,"content":"<p>According to the Department of Finance, the overall amount for the scheme is &euro;50 million.<\/p> <p>  I will address a number of small points.  As part of the medium-term economic strategy in 2013, the Government carried out regular evaluations of tax expenditure.  It is not the responsibility of my Department but that of the Department of Finance to evaluate reliefs on a regular basis.  This is to ensure they meet the policy objectives and support job creation and innovation.  The knowledge development box, KDB, legislation provided for in the Finance Act 2015 included a review clause in order that an evaluation would be conducted.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will undertake a county by county assessment which will be given to the Minister's office.  The Minister will assess the scheme.  It will then be placed before the D&aacute;il, through which forum it will be open to the public and every Deputy to assess and debate how the scheme has operated financially and otherwise county by county.  That is as open as one can get.

Some of the early trailblazers around the country were people like Kitty Howley in Castlebar, Lily O&rsquo;Doherty in Clondalkin, Moira Byrne and Valerie Keegan in Bray, Charlie O&rsquo;Toole in Tallaght, Tom Fitzgerald in Tipperary; the list goes on.  These pioneering volunteers identified the supports that citizens needed long before there were any strategies or consultants like Pathfinder or money available to develop services.  They funded their services with flag days and church gate collections.  That is how it started.<\/p><p> In 1999 local voluntary committees came together at county level with representatives from statutory bodies and other community voluntary groups.  They put together a plan for the development of citizen information services across the counties.  They submitted these plans to the National Social Services Board, NSSB, a predecessor of Comhairle and what is now the Citizens Information Board.  At a board meeting of the NSSB, those plans were approved and county-wide services were established.  Each local committee had a representative on that new county-wide company and, in effect, it was a county-wide restructuring that happened at the turn of the century.  We should be clear that citizen information services are distinctly local and to say they are national is simply incorrect.  To do so is not to understand the history and evolution of citizen information services in the country.<\/p><p> The National Development Managers Network recently commissioned a report on citizens information services in Ireland titled Making an Impact: The Public Value of Citizens Information Services in Ireland.  We have submitted a copy to the committee and the report provides many facts and figures about services, including detailed case studies.  It shows how our services are making a difference every single day for citizens in this country.  It also references how our services have been supporting the development of citizen information and advice models across the European Union.  I will mention one figure to the committee, which might be the most important figure we could mention in the course of this morning.  An average of 2,300 citizens will make contact with their local citizen information services today, with over 1,800 calling in person.  If the committee wishes, we would welcome the opportunity later to take it through the report in some detail.<\/p><p> I will briefly turn to restructuring and how we got here.  In 2014, Pathfinder Consultants were engaged by CIB to do a feasibility study.  It was to \"demonstrate the need or otherwise for greater integration of the management and organisational structures supporting services with the objective of achieving better outcomes for citizens.  Pathfinder did not demonstrate anything with empirical evidence and it is very poor in that regard.  It ended up with a recommendation after 60 pages, stating:<\/p><p>Our preferred option ... is to consolidate the boards as much as possible as close as to a single point of authority for each of MABS and CIS. [&hellip;.]  The closer the structure can get to the 'single board' scenario, the closer the stakeholders get to service delivery and the closer the service gets to stakeholders.<\/p><p>Who are the stakeholders being spoken about?  It is very clearly the funder as the sentence makes absolutely no sense if it is the citizen.  In that case, it would read \"The closer the citizen gets to service delivery and the closer the service gets to the citizen\", which makes absolutely no sense.  The key stakeholder envisaged here is clearly the funder, not the citizen or taxpayer.<\/p><p> I have spoken a little about the background of the Citizens Information Service through the years and how the needs of the citizen have dictated the evolution of that service.  I will speak a little about the narrative of the Citizens Information Board and how it has changed quite recently.  A respectful and dynamic narrative was historically in existence between CIB and services over many decades.  CIB provided significant support to services, particularly in the area of information technology support, training and service promotion.  We have had robust exchanges down the years with CIB and we have not always agreed but there always was a sense that we respected each other enough to base claims on solid evidence.  We did not base any claims on appeals to an authority.  We were dealing with people who clearly understood what it is to fund a service that occupies the privileged space between the State and the citizen.  That is how it used to be.  Sadly, that narrative has changed.<\/p><p> In the CIB annual report of 2015, the chair of CIB, Ms Ita Mangan, in her chairperson's report states:<\/p><p>Our distinctive structure &ndash; a network of independent services, deeply embedded in local communities, funded and supported by a statutory agency &ndash; gives us a unique strength.  Without the close relationship each service has with its local community, we could not deliver on our remit &ndash; providing information, advice, advocacy and budgeting services, when and where they are needed.<\/p><p>When we come to the 2015 annual report, there is no mention of a \"network of independent services\" in either the chairperson&rsquo;s report or the chief executive officer's overview.  In the overview of 2015 from the chief executive officer, Angela Black characterises the relationship between CIB and the services as follows: \"We are continuing to develop our services through the companies that deliver them.\"  That is a dramatic change in narrative and CISs are now seen as instruments of delivery and means to an end.  There is no longer any sense of a unique strength from a network of independent services deeply embedded in local communities.<\/p><p> At a joint committee meeting two weeks ago there was much talk about governance and accountability.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was mentioned on more than one occasion.  At this stage I point the committee to two documents we have submitted which demonstrate very clearly how CISs are micro-governed.  These are the Financial Controls and Reporting Requirements for Citizens Information Services in receipt of a Citizens Information Board Operational Grant and the service agreement that citizens information services sign with CIB.  Both are very detailed documents spelling out clearly the responsibilities and requirements on citizens information services which access funding.  The service agreement not only goes through the conditions on which funding is allocated but also mentions funding being withdrawn.  At section 7.2, it states that funding can be withdrawn without cause.  How governance can be an issue with these exacting controls and agreements in place is absolutely puzzling.  If services are not following the rules or there is a variation in services provided, CIB must act.  The National Development Managers Network is not aware of any citizens information service across this country being sanctioned by the Citizens Information Board for breaches of service level agreements or financial controls.<\/p><p> At the previous joint committee meeting, reference was made to underperforming services.  \"Poor services\" was the quote.  There was no reference to whom CIB was referring.  In 2014 and 2015, all CIS and Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, company services went through an independent evaluation and all services received all services received quality awards to Gold Star Service Excellence standard.  There was an intensive process that services went through to get these and we were evaluated under headings like \"customer-friendly policies\", \"learning from customers\", and \"delivering customer service excellence\".  Why were the underperforming, poor services not rooted out during the Gold Star Service Excellence process?  Why does the CIB not withhold funding and enforce service level agreements or financial controls if there are so many problems?  I suggest there are no problems as indicated.<\/p><p> I will turn briefly to the proposed regional model for MABS and CISs.  It is important to note that the stated rationale for restructuring in the CIB strategic plan for 2015 to 2018 has three elements.  They are to \"better serve the citizen\", improve \"the delivery of consistent high-quality services\" and \"to maximise effective use of resources\".  How does the proposed structure perform under these criteria?  Will a regionalised CIB-controlled structure better serve the citizen?  The citizen is a key stakeholder but the citizen has not been properly consulted.<\/p><p>No evidence exists that citizens are dissatisfied with the service currently provided and, crucially, no evidence has been provided that a regionalised service with an extra tier of regional managers will better serve the citizen.<\/p><p> The Citizens Information Board, CIB, has confirmed that the proposed regional boards will not have directors representing community and voluntary organisations.  Regional boards will be remote, inaccessible and unaccountable to the areas they serve.  That is hardly serving the citizen better.  The additional costs of the regionalised structure are being spent on a tier of regional managers, not on front-line service delivery personnel.  How will that benefit the citizen?  Citizen information services, CISs, in working in the space between the citizen and the State, have a social policy remit and use that to highlight issues of concern regarding the operation of Government schemes and services.  Restructuring will close that space and pull services closer to Government and away from the citizen.<\/p><p> The second rationale is that a regionalised CIB controlled structure will improve the delivery of consistent high quality services.  No evidence has been provided to support that.  The Pathfinder study merely states the funder&rsquo;s hunch, which is that \"CIB feels that a central authority is a logical development in the evolution of the services that helps assure consistent quality\".  Where is the evidence?  As I said already, it is important, in terms of consistent high quality service, to remember that all services have got their Gold Star Service Excellence Awards.<\/p><p> On the regional structure maximising the effective use of resources, it should be pointed out that no cost-benefit analysis has as yet been seen for this regionalised structure.  Restructuring, dismantling existing companies, setting up new ones, recruiting regional managers and transferring existing staff to new boards is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;500,000.  The additional cost of restructuring, if CIB intends to engage 16 regional managers, will be in the region of &euro;75,000 per manager when salary, employer PRSI, pension, travel and subsistence costs are factored in.  That will come to &euro;1.2 million, unless they decide that there will be managers' roles within the existing service that will be lost and therefore that will achieve some savings.  We have not got clarity on that; we do not know.  It is not clear how much the CIB appointed regional boards will cost.  No detail has been made available.  No figures have been given to compare the current cost of voluntary boards with the new CIB appointed boards.<\/p><p> There are currently 1,089 volunteers in the CIS network who have a right of participation on boards.  Those volunteers will not be represented on the new boards.  Effectively, volunteers are being disenfranchised in this new model and they may well vote with their feet.  We know from some of our colleagues that volunteers are somewhat disillusioned with this entire process and have voted with their feet already.  In recent weeks, some development managers and other senior staff have already started to move on.  We are losing good people.  The workforce is demotivated and there is a lot of fear.  The workforce is demoralised because of a process that was not open and transparent and about which there was no real dialogue.<\/p><p> Some comment has been made about the cost of audited accounts for 93 companies.  If the CIB believes money can be saved on audits and accounts, there is nothing stopping it from tendering for an accountancy or an audit firm to carry out audits for the 93 companies and perhaps achieve savings that way.  Given the similarity between companies, I expect substantial savings could be achieved by having a tendering process for that.<\/p><p> On the position of the citizens information services, it is important we consider the situation in the United Kingdom.  In the UK, money advice and citizen advice services are provided alongside each other, and it is important to note that local models are retained in the UK.  I reference the Citizens Advice Annual Report and Accounts 2015\/2016, which state:<\/p><p>Citizens Advice is a national charity with 307 local Citizens Advice members which are all individual charities in their own right.  Together we make up the Citizens Advice service.<\/p><p>Another publication, Making the Case: The value to society of the Citizens Advice service, which was published in the UK in April 2014, states:<\/p><p>We act as one service, with one vision, yet we are also rooted in each and every community across England and Wales.  Our bureaux are staffed by local people who are passionate about their community and sensitive to local needs.<\/p><p> If we were to integrate MABS and CIS services, what would that achieve?  It would reduce the number of voluntary boards from 93, which has been described as unwieldy, down to approximately 30.  It would ensure that the services were still community-based.  It would be far more cost-effective.  A total of &euro;1.2 million would not be required for an additional tier of regional managers, and it would achieve annual savings on accountancy and audit fees of approximately &euro;126,000.<\/p><p> From the outset, the push to regionalisation has been driven from the top by the CIB.  There has been no dialogue, even though dialogue has been sought by services.  At best, issues highlighted by the network have been noted, parked and subsequently ignored.  Representatives were sought from representative bodies to serve on a restructuring sub-committee set up by the CIB at the beginning of this year, and as a condition of their participation, they were requested to accept a confidentiality agreement which prevented them from discussions with the membership they were supposed to be representing.  Where dialogue is thwarted, goodwill disappears.  Goodwill is based on respect, trust, common understanding, relationships and how we treat each other.  In the end, a regionalised, restructured service may look very good on paper but that is the only place it will look good.<\/p><p> I want to refer to some of the comments made by CIB representatives at the last joint committee meeting.  The chair of the CIB, Ita Mangan, stated that the CIB was \"only changing the back room\", suggesting that management and structural changes will have no impact on the front line.  However, this restructuring is not about a behind the scenes change.  What happens in Castlebar citizens information centre, CIC, will be decided by the Citizens Information Board in Dublin, which will have total control over the board, the chair and the regional manager it has appointed in perhaps Galway.  The CIB will have appointed all of those.  To describe that as a back room change is a ridiculous analogy, but what is most concerning about that is the misleading impression it creates.<\/p><p> The CIB stated also that there was no dissent on the restructuring sub-committee.  The committee was set up by the CIB with six CIB members, comprising three staff and three board members from the CIB, and four CIS-MABS representatives.  The CIS and the MABS representatives were gagged with confidentiality on joining the group.  They could not report back to or represent anyone.<\/p><p> The CIS stated here two weeks ago that there will be no changes during the lifetime of the restructuring programme, which ends at the end of 2018.  The reality is that all bets are off after that.  What will the service look like on 1 January 2019?  That is the key question.<\/p><p> Governance, accountability and value for money were the three reasons given by the chair of CIB at the previous joint committee meeting for the dismantling of local services.  Governance and accountability are red herrings.  We have referenced documents and the exacting demands that are made on citizens information services through service agreements and financial controls.  We could go through those in detail if the members wish.<\/p><p> It has not been demonstrated by CIB how the proposed regional model will better serve the citizen, improve the delivery of consistent high quality services or be a more effective use of resources.  In fact, this model will cost.  It will take community representation out of services and services out of communities.  It will position them closer to Government.  Perhaps this is part of the promised new narrative for rural areas.  It should be remembered that &euro;1.2 million will be spent on regional managers, not on front-line service delivery.<\/p><p> The key stakeholder, the citizen, deserves access to our services in an independent space where issues are listened to and addressed and can be fed into the formation of social policy, a space that connects Government, public services and citizens, where face-to-face interaction is welcomed and not simply tolerated - an empathic supportive space.<\/p><p> We are providing evidence here today of financial controls and governance compliance.  We are not aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General has any issues with citizen information services.  We are asking the Minister, who has the power under the Citizens Information Act of 2007, to issue a directive to the Citizens Information Board to halt this proposed regionalisation.  Let sense prevail.  Let the established bodies and CIB embark on an open, meaningful, constructive dialogue about this issue.  We have a responsibility to the citizen.  We need to get this right, build on what exists already, look closely at what works very efficiently in the UK and move towards integration of services at county level, with an acknowledgement that services in larger population areas like Dublin, Cork and Kildare will need to be looked at slightly differently.  It is not too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Lally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1461,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Lally for his opening statement.

I am the chair of the National Association of Citizens Information Services.  I am joined by our project manager, Joe Rynn.  We welcome the opportunity to bring forward our views on the proposed restructuring of Citizens Information services.  We are at a major watershed moment in citizens information in Ireland, and the decision to restructure the model of service delivery will without doubt have a serious impact, for good or ill, on our future.  A citizens information service is one of the hallmarks of a modern democratic society, as are, for example, Free Legal Advice Centres, the various ombudsman offices, etc.  Such services are conspicuously absent from less democratic regimes, and with good reason.  Citizens Information Services seek in some measure to empower ordinary people to vindicate their rights and entitlements.  We in some way help to redress the enormous power imbalances that exist in our society between, on the one hand, the State and its various agencies and, on the other, those on the margins.<\/p> <p>  The National Association of Citizens Information Services is the national representative body of Citizens Information Services and was established in November 2006.  The main objectives of our association are to represent the collective views of the local Citizens Information Services nationally and to inform policy and strategic planning in respect of those services with a view to benefiting the individuals and communities serviced by Citizens Information Services, promoting social inclusion and tackling disadvantage.  This is based on the legislation.  The association has the important role of representing all the local stakeholders involved in service delivery.  We represent the views of our members, that is, the 42 services.  The members are made up of three strands, as we call them: the board members of the CIS companies, which provide their support and expertise on a voluntary basis; the employees of the services, including the development managers, information officers, administrators and others; and, equally importantly, the 1,100 volunteers whom we represent and who deliver front-line services to our customers and clients.<\/p> <p>  Since restructuring was first proposed by the Citizens Information Board, the national association has sought to engage constructively with the Citizens Information Board.  Our primary objective has at all times been the protection and enhancement of the services we deliver.  However, in our view, the Citizens Information Board has not at any time made a compelling case for the need for change in order to improve services.  Since their inception, the Citizens Information Services have operated on a communitarian basis, funded by the State rather than constituting a centralised service provided by the State, and this is the crucial distinction.  A structure that will maintain the community ethos of the Citizens Information Services is required.  The proposal to regionalise and centralise the service will fundamentally change our ethos.<\/p> <p>  We have consistently expressed the view that structural changes will not by themselves lead to improved outcomes for the service and that incorrect structural changes have the potential to damage the service and weaken the public's confidence in it.  As public representatives, the committee members do not need me to remind them of the consequences of similar approaches in the health services, local government and elsewhere in recent years.  We question the efficiency gains, if any, to be achieved from this restructuring and are very concerned about the potential implications of the proposed regional model.<\/p> <p>  NACIS accepts and supports the proposition that there is scope to deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness in how we do our business.  However, unless all the other key components, including systems of governance, management and staffing, fit-for-purpose IT systems and tools, and effective policies and procedures, are addressed in an integrated and systematic way, we will not deliver a better service.  Structural changes will not make any difference in this regard.  Most fundamentally, developing proposals for change should start at the front line, where services are delivered, and work up from there, rather than a top-down approach whereby the impact on service users is the last thing taken into consideration.<\/p> <p>  NACIS has offered a clear viewpoint to the Citizens Information Board on our preferred model for service delivery.  This was contained in our submissions towards the development of the Pathfinder report, to which Mr. Lally has referred.  More recently, in the NACIS presentation to the Citizens Information Board, we outlined our concerns over the restructuring and our preference for a county or community-based model.  We also highlighted the potential for integration of service delivery between the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and CISs as a means of strengthening governance arrangements and generating greater efficiencies while maintaining the communitarian ethos.  While the CIB may claim it has engaged in a consultative process, the view of our membership is that no meaningful engagement has taken place and that the views of those who best understand the realities and challenges of service delivery have not been taken on board.<\/p> <p>  A key strength and resource CIS has is the central role of its volunteers.  Like MABS, the CIS boards are voluntary and board members give freely of their time to serve on our local boards.  Uniquely, CISs also include volunteers who deliver front-line service, reception, information and, in a small number of cases, advocacy services to the public, with over 1,100 volunteers working in these areas.  It is interesting to note that very few Citizens Information Services have paid reception staff as most of our reception is done by volunteers.  Some Citizens Information Centres take on people on CE schemes.  This model is unique and only available within the Citizens Information Services, where citizens work to support and assist their fellow citizens to access their rights and entitlements.  This has been our ethos, as Mr. Lally said, since day one.  It is estimated that 66% of our service to the public is delivered by volunteers.<\/p> <p>  The proposed regional model has potential negative impacts for all the key stakeholders.  There is a real concern, to which Mr. Lally has already referred because it has started already, that volunteers will become disengaged from the Citizens Information Service.  They will be denied the right to board representation, and local leadership of their service will disappear.  Without such strong local leadership and direct connection to the community, it is likely to be more difficult to encourage and engage volunteers into the future.  This will present a significant cost for the CIB to manage.  Services will either be curtailed or staff will be required to replace the loss of the voluntary input at front-line service delivery.  As well as direct financial impacts, the intangible asset of active citizenship and the communitarian approach, which has been our thing, could be lost forever.<\/p> <p>  As referred to earlier, local Citizens Information Services are currently managed by a voluntary board of directors with the support of a paid development manager.  A key strength of the local boards is the strong organic connection to the local community, including local civil society representatives such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Threshold and other relevant local agencies.  It is worth reminding ourselves, before we cut the local link, that the services grew organically from the communities which they serve.  In the context of modern governance requirements, NACIS accepts the need to strengthen systems of governance to enhance oversight, transparency, accountability for public funds, etc., but this can be achieved without throwing away the experience and expertise that exists within the network.<\/p> <p>  Regarding employees, while NACIS does not play any formal role in the management of human resource and industrial relations issues, we are acutely aware of the concerns and uncertainties among our valued employees and managers.<\/p><p>In particular, it is concerned about the impact these changes will have on the morale and motivation of its development managers and staff. <\/p><p> As indicated, I am presenting our initial response, as determined by our national executive, to the restructuring proposals.  We will be consulting further with our members in the very near future.  However, we have some additional observations to make at this time.  <\/p><p>As Mr. Lally has already mentioned, we have grave concerns over the lifetime of the restructuring programme.  I refer to the phrase in the document.  Clarity is required on the timeline in the context of commitments to no changes to service locations and terms and conditions of employment of our managers and staff. <\/p><p> We are very concerned about board selection.  NACIS has strong concerns regarding the proposed composition, purpose and scope of the new boards, in addition to the proposed recruitment process, which is similar to the Public Appointments Service process.  This approach has the potential to discourage serving Citizens Information Board, CIB, board members from going forward.  There is a real need for continuity between existing boards and whatever new structures are put in place.  This needs to be recognised in the creation of any new structure and specific provision must be made to ensure existing boards continue to be represented.  The new boards must act as a guarantor of independence of the service, ensuring that the communitarian ethos of the service is maintained.  This has been a basic principle of the service since its inception over 40 years ago.<\/p><p> With regard to staff, there is a need for a clear plan or structure to be published.  Our staff, including development managers, information staff and volunteers working in the current services, are not clear on their future roles, and there is an imminent risk of losing vital local expertise if a clear plan is not set out.  Staff are unclear as to how the new regional structures will operate.  In fact, they know nothing about this because it is a closely guarded secret.  The lack of clarity is generating significant worry and uncertainty.  There is nothing more damaging to a voluntary or community-type organisation than uncertainty about the future and this needs to be addressed urgently.<\/p><p> Mr. Lally has already referred to recent resignations.  These were just down the road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is a service substantially run by volunteers.  Long-serving members are so disillusioned by what is going on that they have opted out.  That is worrying.  With regard to stakeholders, the lack of a reference in the document to volunteers and service users in any meaningful way is very disappointing, as is the absence of a reference to our organisation, NACIS.<\/p><p> On communications, NACIS has highlighted the need for the Citizens Information Board to maintain strong communication and engagement with the representative bodies.  Much mention has been made of consultation but the CIB must begin to demonstrate engagement in meaningful consultation.  This includes accepting and responding positively to recommendations from NACIS and the other representative organisations but equally, where our recommendations are not accepted, the CIB board must provide explanations and reasons for its decision.  That is normal in any democracy.  We are not saying everything we say should be accepted but we should at least be given reasons for decisions.<\/p><p> NACIS recommends that the Citizens Information Service board establish a forum that includes representatives of the CIB and the representative groups, such as NACIS and MABS groups, to meet on an annual basis.  This will provide an important forum for the CIB board to meet and hear from the services directly. <\/p><p> Having said all that, it is important to say that we acknowledge and appreciate the support, leadership and training provided by the board and executive of CIB over the years.  Mr. Lally has already referred to this.  Without them, we would not be here at all.  Our wish is to work with them constructively on delivering our common objective of having a better service.  All of us are committed to this.<\/p><p> NACIS has outlined in previous written submissions its preferred model to support consolidation within the network.  Any realignment or consolidation will need to include careful consideration of potential implications and whether a direct change will improve the service for the citizen.  Any restructuring proposal must not undermine or weaken one of the key founding principles legislated for in the creation of the CIB, which was \"to promote greater accessibility, co-ordination and public awareness of social services and of information, advice and advocacy services provided in relation to such services whether by a statutory body or a voluntary body\".  The need to ensure accessibility to services locally is a fundamental principle that the citizens information services have worked to achieve and, indeed, have done.  This is demonstrated through our strong outreach supports around the counties in which we operate and active involvement of citizens on a voluntary basis in service delivery.<\/p><p> Citizens information services are currently provided using a model of service delivery appropriate for service users by advocating frequently on their behalf, against the State and its agencies.  While supported by the State through CIB, independence is both guaranteed and evidenced by the local boards of management.  The proposed regional model, based not on local leadership but on a CIB-selected and CIB-led board of management, will offer a more centralised approach, with its independence compromised from the outset.  We are very concerned that this structure and method of appointment constitutes a State-delivered service that would not be appropriate or in the best interest of the citizen.  The degree of control implicit in the proposed model is more akin to what is required for an agency that needs to be controlled by the State.  It is not an appropriate model on which to base the type of service provided by our members.  The CIS is Government-funded, but it cannot be perceived to be Government-run.<\/p><p> Our primary concern is with the quality and accessibility of the services we deliver, while retaining the trust and confidence of those who use them.  The area or county community-based model represents the right balance between retaining the local dimension and delivering consistent standards of governance, management and efficiency.  The reliance on volunteer input and active citizenship is a unique feature that needs to be protected and sustained.  We want to engage constructively on implementation, provided that consultation is meaningful.  We thank members for their attention and will welcome any questions they may have for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McGuane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1464,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGuane for his opening statement.

This is a topic we are taking very seriously and we are trying to deal with it as quickly as we can.  I commend CIS on its work.  I see at first hand how busy the offices are in Wicklow, the constituency I represent.  The delegates alluded to the fact that over 2,300 people will make contact with CIS today and every other day and that over 1,800 people will make direct contact by walking into the offices.  The work is essential.  I commend everyone involved, particularly all the volunteers.  I become concerned when I hear volunteers are walking away from the organisation because of uncertainty with regard to restructuring and regionalisation, including in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.<\/p><p>Obviously, as Mr. Lally said, there will be a serious impact.  He mentioned that it is critical to empower the citizen.  That is one of the primary roles and functions.  One must question why the CIB has not engaged in a meaningful consultation process with the witnesses or with the public.  Other regulatory bodies undertake consultations which are open to the public to give its response.  That critical part of the consultation process is missing and I am concerned about that.  Mr. Lally made the point that the process has not been open or transparent, and that is coming across to me and other people.  It is alarming.  He also states that CIB has not made a compelling case at any time for the need for change.  Why is it moving ahead with this?  A question was asked about seeing the cost-benefit analysis.  It is clear from the previous contributions that have been made to the committee that no cost-benefit analysis has been carried out with regard to these changes.<\/p><p> Perhaps Mr. Rynn or Mr. McGuane will respond to my questions.  I spoke about stakeholders and the need for CIB to engage with them.  Was any reason provided to the witnesses at any point for their organisations not being seen as key stakeholders in a consultation?  As they said, the citizens do not appear to be seen as stakeholders.  Do they know who the key stakeholders were in this?  The witness said the organisation sought to engage with the CIB.  How was that undertaken and what was the reason for it being refused?  Mr. McGuane also referred to governance.  The previous presentation from the CIB mentioned statutory obligations that the current structure may not reach.  I note it was mentioned that the Comptroller and Auditor General has no issues.  The CIB spoke about a compliance statement required from the Comptroller and Auditor General and, in respect of governance, it spoke of the principles required, such as clarity of governance, value for money and fairness.  Does Mr. McGuane believe the present structure would fail these obligations, given that he stated the Comptroller and Auditor General has no cause for concern?<\/p><p> I have a few other points for Mr. Lally.  He referred to franchising.  When I hear the word \"franchising\" it sets off alarm bells because there is the potential for privatisation in the future.  Does he believe there is an intention to have a form of privatisation or a contracted system in the future?  I have real concerns about that.  On some of the other points, I am probably over time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#G00300","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1467,"content":"<p>You are over time and I must be fair to other colleagues.

I have much to discuss but my time is limited so I will try to deal with a few key questions, to which any of the witnesses may respond.<\/p> <p>  What we heard about the consultation is interesting, as it is a core starting point.  What we heard is striking, especially in the presentation from NACIS.  I am concerned about the confidentiality issue.  Was there an adequate facility for Mr. Lally to be able to consult on the ground?  The confidentiality concern would appear to go against discussion and also consultation with the public and service users.  We hear consistently about the shortfalls in consultation, so that should be examined.  I am also interested in the previous restructuring we heard about, the county-wide restructuring, which appeared to operate in a completely different way.  Perhaps both speakers will outline what was different about that restructuring.  In the first place, it appears to have been successful.  The witnesses talked about it starting at the front line and Mr. Lally mentioned people coming together to submit proposals.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on how the county-wide restructuring ensured local representation, moved from the bottom up rather than from the top down and what should be learned from that.<\/p> <p>  Also, it appears that the CIS already underwent a restructuring in that process.  Mr. Lally mentioned the idea of the county model, with or without MABS, being something that should be examined.  What are the thoughts of NACIS on that?  Perhaps, Chairman, we might refer back to MABS, seeking its views on that model.  It seems to be emerging quite strongly as the preferred model, so it might be one to be considered.  Was it given adequate consideration as a model?  I note that the extension of MABS and CIS was not one of the models discussed in the Pathfinder Consulting report.  I also note with some concern, as my colleague did, that the funder model, or a type of franchise funder model, was identified in the Pathfinder Consulting report as one which would be damaging to services.  We must be aware of that danger given that it was identified by Pathfinder Consulting as something that would potentially lead to a deterioration in services.<\/p> <p>  There has not been a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed eight and eight model that has been put forward.  There have been other cost-benefit analyses and I look forward to them being shared with the speakers and to hearing their comments on those models, including the county model.<\/p> <p>  A core point comes across strongly in this report and from all the speakers.  It also comes across in the correspondence we have received from individual citizens information services.  It is the advocacy role.  To be clear, it is not the National Advocacy Service, which is a service for particular individuals and supports.  I refer to the general advocacy role or the democracy role.  NACIS put it as the role of at times being in a position of having to advocate against Departments or against the State to champion the citizen.  Perhaps the witness would clarify that component, which is not simply a delivery of factual information downwards, because that is part of the core of the work and it came across very strongly.  That is an area that could be in jeopardy because, as the witness said, the perception of independence is crucial in that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the volunteers, we heard from MABS about its concern in respect of voluntary board members, their ongoing engagement and the costs.  Perhaps Mr. Lally could elaborate on some of the costs.  I accept that they are rough costs, but there is the potential danger of the loss of almost 1,100 front-line staff.  We have front-line volunteers.  I am aware that the volunteers are not just volunteers who are in place.  There is an extraordinary quality of volunteer within our citizens information services, as many of us have experienced.  I have experienced in the NGO sector and in political life how people rely on not just the volunteers but also the quality of the volunteers.  Perhaps the witnesses could discuss that question of engagement.<\/p><p>I have also been a member of advisory groups myself and I know that they are different from boards.  As I am very aware of that, I seek clarification on the question of the potential disengagement of volunteers.  I agree with the concerns expressed regarding no changes during the lifetime of restructuring.  What are the potential impact costs and consequences of this model if it is pushed ahead, particularly if it is pushed in an unwilling context?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#H00300","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1470,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses to our meeting.  I could be seen to have a slight conflict of interest here because I served on the west Cork citizens information board a number of years ago.  I do not really understand where all of this is coming from and I fully agree with many of the sentiments expressed earlier.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the service in Cork, in 2015 there were 10,834 callers and 18,635 queries, while the figures for 2016 were 10,878 and 18,295 respectively.  The figures for this year are already up by 10% on last year.  The service is driven locally, by a local board.  I was on the board as a community voluntary member.  In a different life, the now European Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, decided to rid boards of local volunteers.  It is a nice, clever way of having a more dictatorial role over what is going on and it looks like that is what is happening here too.  <\/p> <p>  The witnesses said that no cost benefit analysis has been conducted.  Who has instructed the Citizens Information Board, CIB?  Representatives from CIB were before us earlier but unfortunately I was not aware of what is going on; otherwise I would have asked those questions of them.  Is it a ministerial decision?  Is it coming straight from the top?  Is the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, turning out to be Mr. Hogan's replacement in life?  If so, he needs to come before the people and discuss this because citizens information boards are providing a fabulous service in west Cork and throughout the country.  If the Government starts to weaken or water down the service, as has been done with the Leader groups, it will only lead to further erosion of local services, especially in rural Ireland, where we are finding it difficult to survive as it is.  Will we be left in a situation where CIB handpicks the boards and there will be no local input?  That would be a scandalous decision and it must be resisted by us, as Members of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I believe we will lose the independence of the service and that is probably the plan.  The aim is to lose the local input.  As I said earlier, there were 18,295 queries to the citizens information office in west Cork last year.  That office has three full-time, three part-time and five scheme workers and the rest of the workers are volunteers.  There are 20 volunteers working there and I can assure everyone that those volunteers would not be there were it not for the local board working and communicating with them and encouraging them to come and help out.  A lot of questions need to be asked.  The witnesses before us have highlighted the situation for us and this committee must now take it from here.  We must determine if we can stop this from happening.  Perhaps the witnesses could give us some advice as to the role we could play in that regard.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#J00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1471,"content":"<p>The witnesses before us today have outlined exactly the concerns that I have, as a public representative in a rural area.  Is this a direct attempt to prevent poor people from getting information about their entitlements?  Is that what this is about?  Is that what the Government is about?  I can see, and am not afraid to say it, that the CIB would not be doing what it is doing without ministerial approval.  As Deputy Michael Collins has said, this is similar to what was done to the Leader programmes and the rural development organisations by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan.  Is this another savage attack on rural Ireland?  I am afraid it is just that.<\/p> <p>  The CIB representatives described the service provided by MABS as ranging from extremely good, to average, to quite poor.  Never once, in my role as an elected public representative in Kerry - both as a councillor and a Deputy - have I heard a complaint about MABS.  All I have heard is people expressing gratitude for the information that MABS provided.  As everyone is well aware, most of the people who provide information in the citizens information offices are volunteers.  If we are going to reduce the number of citizens information offices, we will make the service regional rather than local.  In rural Ireland, we know all about regional restructuring.  When we hear the term restructuring, whether applied to the ambulance service or to any other service, we know that it will actually mean a reduction in services.  We will move from having a service with which we were quite happy to a reduction in that service.  The witnesses have already confirmed this to be the case.  Why is this happening?  Will it be a State-driven service that will only tell people what it likes because it might not suit the Department that would be paying out the money?  That is what I am afraid of.  Great work was being done by the CIS boards at a local level but the CIB is going to take them over and deprive the people of the service they were getting.  The service is going to be dismantled.  <\/p> <p>  In 2017, the CIB is to receive &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is to be given to the CIS groups and &euro;24 million to MABS.  How much of the budget is going to be kept by the CIB in 2018?  It is shameful, what is happening.  As elected representatives, Deputy Michael Collins and I will do everything we can to highlight this shameful situation.  What will happen to people in rural areas if they lose this great service, which is mostly volunteer-driven?  What will be the role of volunteers in the future if the CIB gets its way?  This is a very serious matter and will be treated as such.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#J00300","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1472,"content":"<p>I thank both groups for their clear presentations.  There was an awful lot of overlap with our meeting of two weeks ago.  A lot of the points made by both groups today were also made two weeks ago to this committee.  I am concerned about the level of consultation and also about what is viewed as consultation.  It appears that the points raised in the so-called dialogue were not taken on board.  The role of the volunteer is key, as the last two speakers have stressed.  I must compliment the citizens information service in County Clare.  It is run very well and the service provided is wonderful.  I have regular engagement with it.<\/p> <p>  We must consider the impact this will have on the service user.  We must also consider the issue of volunteers leaving the service, as Mr. McGuane said earlier.<\/p><p>What level or type of fall-away in volunteers are the services experiencing?

One thing struck me when Mr. Lally was speaking.  His comments brought home the unique nature of the services.  Mr. Lally referred to Lily O'Doherty in Clondalkin.  It is as if the citizens information services have developed in the context of the surrounding services and in the context of interaction with constituency offices of Deputies, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and so on.  They have developed around the network of other services and those involved knew who to engage with and so on.  Local knowledge was crucial.  If we did not have such local knowledge, I am unsure whether the services would have been as effective.  Mr. Lally referred to Lily O'Doherty and how she would go about her work, who she knew and how she knew where to go.  All such local knowledge cannot easily be transferred.  That is what makes the services unique.<\/p> <p>  I have no wish to go over the points made but I want to make a general observation.  Some general points arise and I want to recap on comments Mr. Lally made.  At the end of his contribution he referred to moving towards integration of services at county level and that it was not too late.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McGuane referred to how we have highlighted the potential for integration of service delivery between the citizens information services and MABS as a means of strengthening governance arrangements and generating greater efficiencies while maintaining the community ethos.  As general comment, I see this manifested in three blocks one of which is the current restructuring proposal, as proposed by the Citizens Information Board.  There is another side to the coin.  It came across clearly last week from MABS representatives.  MABS representatives maintain things are working well and wonder about the need for any change.  Mr. McGuane indicated that perhaps there should be a merging of MABS and the Citizens Information Board organisations on a county-wide basis.  Three themes have emerged from the discussions: the current restructuring proposal by the Citizens Information Board, the do-nothing option - some people have indicated they are happy with the service, and the possible merging of citizens information services and MABS on a county-wide basis.<\/p> <p>  Have the representatives from the citizens information services developed proposals for closer working arrangements with MABS?  Have any discussions along these lines taken place?  Do the representatives clearly see a need for restructuring?  Is it feasible to leave the status quo?  The presentations this morning referred to the need for some new model.  This view has not always come from MABS and MABS representatives have not always said the same.  I say as much because these are emerging themes rather than specific points.  The representatives might wish to comment on them.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses can take the answers in any order they wish.  Mr. Lally opened the discussion.  Does he want to take the questions relevant to him?  Ms Barry or Ms Conefrey may wish to contribute as well and we will go on from there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#K00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489053600,"counter":1475,"content":"<p>I will deal first with the point on what has been suggested by us.  I reckon we are in agreement with the National Association of Citizens Information Services.  Our position is the county model, with or without integration with MABS.  There is no divergence with MABS.  MABS presented a clear view on the matter at the previous meeting.  The view was that there should be no change and that nothing is broken so there is no need to fix it.  That is our sense as well in terms of governance and so on.  However, savings could be made.  We have put the idea forward as a possibility but we are not convinced that anything is wrong with the current model that would force us to go down the integration route.  Good relationships exist throughout the country between MABS and the citizens information services.  Many managers of citizens information services, me included, are on the boards of MABS companies.  Good working relationships have developed over several years.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Collins asked who has instructed the Citizens Information Board and where all of this has come from.  These are important questions.  If it has come all the way from the Department of Social Protection, then it introduces another important question that needs to be asked.  Is the Department of Social Protection the correct Department to fund and guarantee the independence of citizens information services?  The Office of the Ombudsman is not funded by the Department of Social Protection.  This introduces a far bigger question.  The National Association of Citizens Information Services may be able to clarify this and where it is coming from.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the consultation with service users and the Pathfinder report.  The Pathfinder report contains details of consultation with 37 service users.  The report was not part of our submission but there is no problem in submitting the material to the joint committee, if needs be.  The Pathfinder document refers to how the consultants sought the points of view of service users and how 37 service users of citizens information services were asked what was important to them as users of the service.  The respondents went through access, empathy, accuracy, assurance of confidentiality and independence, which is an interesting point.  These were important to service users, as was having professional premises etc.  The Pathfinder consultation concluded that service users did not have any well-formed or consistent views on the importance of structures, such as whether there should be a local board or a national oversight structure to deliver the service.  Of course, service users were not asked what would suit best, whether it be a local board, a regional board or a national board.  They were not asked the question.  The Pathfinder consultants came to the conclusion that they could find no significant structural impediments to delivering the service on an individual basis.  We can forward the report to the committee.  It was not in our original submission.  That was the main point on consultation with service users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Lally"},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1476,"content":"<p>Members should note that we have the Pathfinder report on the document database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#K00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1477,"content":"<p>I wish to make a suggestion.

It was put forward as a possible model for restructuring.  Our submission referenced that perhaps after regionalisation it could be the second play in a couple of years' time and that services will be franchised eventually.

In many cases this involves a social welfare appeal where we are going before the very people who fund our service.  It is an extensive and detailed part of the work that goes on within the services and it is important to recognise that there is a link there.  Very often, we are going against our funders in terms of appealing decisions that have been made.  We also assist in cost savings, however, by stepping in before it comes to an appeal by way of reviewing decisions and submitting detailed documentation and evidence.  It is very much an evidence-based approach to providing an advocacy service.<\/p><p> The Making an Impact report, which was submitted to members, details the work that goes on within the services.  It is an evidence-based report that details the works and goings on of the Citizens Information Service, including the voluntary boards and the volunteers who are performing various roles within the service such as reception, information and so on.  The report takes the reader through real-life scenarios.  It is important to mention that there is an international dimension to the Citizens Information Service, which is also detailed in Making an Impact.  We can come back to that if we have time.  I am conscious that there are a lot of questions today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sin&eacute;ad Conefrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489053600,"counter":1481,"content":"<p>I will come in on the issue of the volunteers.  Everyone has spoken about the impact on volunteers of this potential restructuring.  Following on from the MABS presentation, Citizens Information is unique in that we have three strands in our service, namely, paid core staff, community employment, CE, scheme workers who provide information, and volunteers.  We have volunteer board members giving up their free time, energy and expertise.  We also have volunteers who come into our service on a daily basis to give front-line information to service users.  The minimum requirement for these volunteers is to give seven hours a week.  The expectation is that these volunteers would be trained up in the extensive information that is available through the Citizens Information website and to provide professional information to a client.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of this restructuring on volunteers, it is my view that people volunteer for a local service.  There is a buy-in.  They may have had contact with MABS, the St. Vincent de Paul, the local Deputy or whatever, and they feel that they want to give something back to their local service.  That is going to be lost if it is run on a regional basis.  We spoke already about people voting with their feet and moving on.  We cannot assess that impact at the moment as there is a huge vacuum of information, and that is the concern.  We really do not know how our own jobs are going to be, how the volunteer boards are going to be or what is going to happen.  We cannot give members definitive answers to those questions.  However, people are currently volunteering in a local service because they feel they can give something back to their locality.  There is a demand there.  Members have heard figures about how much the service is used and respected in all sorts of places.  I believe that will be lost.  We do not know how to capture that.  It is something we will need to address in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla Barry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489053600,"counter":1482,"content":"<p>Senator Higgins asked me a specific question about the previous county-wide restructuring.  From my experience in Mayo, when I became the manager of Mayo Citizens Information Service we had four local committees in Ballina, Castlebar, Claremorris and Belmullet.  The four committees came together with members from other local and statutory groups, such as the Department of Social Protection, and put together a plan to integrate the services throughout the county.  I was appointed in April 2000 to work with this newly-constituted board that had representatives from all the local committees.  That was key.  Each committee was represented on the county-wide board so they had a say in what was going to happen.  There was buy-in and there was a process as well.  There was an initial stage when services might have felt that they were happy doing their own little thing or whatever.  But it was clearly seen, through dialogue and an open process, that this was going to be of benefit to the community and to the county-wide area of Mayo.  By having open discussion and making sure that resources were being spread properly through the area, people began to see that it was for the good of their services.  It made sense because it was the same as the local authority area of Mayo; we were dealing with Mayo County Council - so there was a link-in with service providers at that level.  It made sense.  The county model seemed to be the correct level at which to integrate.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady also asked if the present structure would fail governance requirements.  We have submitted documents to the committee; perhaps we need to go through them, perhaps not.  I referenced the service level agreement, which is very exact.  There are exacting demands being placed on citizens information services, not only in terms of the service but also of the financial controls.  I do not know if the committee wants to go through the detail on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Lally"},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1483,"content":"<p>We have the documents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#L00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489053600,"counter":1484,"content":"<p>It is very detailed.  It would be very difficult to start hiding money or doing anything like that.  It is all accounted for and above board.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Carey asked about the potential for dialogue.  As chair of the development managers network I would say we are very much open to dialogue.  We want dialogue.  Our focus here is really the citizen.  That is what started up the first citizens information services - to serve the citizens' needs.  That is why we are here this morning.  Our role is to advocate on behalf of the citizen.  We are not here to preserve our own jobs or whatever.  We are here to argue for the citizens and say what we believe is in their best interests.  The service is working.  Maybe there are areas in which we can improve, there always are.  We are certainly open to and welcome dialogue but not to the sort of consultation we have got, in which our opinions are noted and then ignored while the juggernaut goes on regardless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom&aacute;s Lally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489053600,"counter":1485,"content":"<p>I will not reiterate the points my colleagues have already made.  In terms of the point which Senator Higgins and Deputy Brady referenced, consultation is meaningful when it involves taking our points on board, engaging with us and possibly reaching agreement.  We are in a process here whereby things are more or less being imposed.  We are not at an agreement stage.  Engagement and consultation is about agreeing on a common plan and course of action with members.  We do not have agreement on where we are going and we need that for us to engage with and implement a plan.<\/p> <p>  Members also discussed the issue of volunteers, which has been mentioned briefly by my other colleagues.  From our perspective, the remoteness of the board will have a real risk in terms of engagement with volunteers, as we have highlighted in our submission.  Large-scale regional structures do not have the same presence in or connection to local communities.  That loss will be evident very quickly and will most likely have a detrimental effect on how volunteers engage with services.  We are very concerned about that.<\/p> <p>  It is the same thing with the boards.  They have been built up through local input.  We are looking at a very different structure now, very much a top-down regional model.  The boards were organic and grew from local communities.  People understood their areas and had a very strong understanding of county needs.  Every county has different requirements; the Deputies know that themselves from their own work.  Large regional structures do not have that input.  We would be concerned that the dynamic of the regional boards will be lost within the new boards.  We have also highlighted that in our submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Rynn"},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1486,"content":"<p>There is time for one or two direct and brief questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#L00700","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1487,"content":"<p>Pathfinder has been mentioned extensively.  I note that the Pathfinder report said the current structures are working well in respect of exercising control of legal and financial compliance.<\/p><p>The Pathfinder report also states that the structures that support core processes and local boards are established and work well.  The report also states that the staff resources centrally of the Citizens Information Board, CIB, have been reduced.  We have heard that the number of staff has been reduced from 92 to 74. The only palpable change in a system that seemed to be working is that there has been a reduction of staff at central level.  The approach appears to be one of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut given that we have seen a reduction of almost 20 staff at central level.  There are many other issues identified in Pathfinder report but one issue is that the increased focus on compliance with so many companies is proving to be an unsustainable burden, given the number of boards and reduction in staff.  The key point is the reduction of the CIB's staff resources of resources.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that aspect.  <\/p><p> I also wish to comment on the advocacy element, which was a point that was raised by National Association of Citizens Information Services, NACIS,  It raised the interesting question of democracy.   I am referring to the question of social inclusion as a core mandate of this service.  What is interesting about the boards as they are currently constituted is that we are looking at a modelling of social inclusion.  It is not that they simply deliver a service to people that helps them to do something, rather it is a modelling of social inclusion to an effect.   Reference was made to volunteers but I would like one of the witnesses to elaborate specifically on the question of social inclusion and the democratic component for a volunteer in not only delivering a service, but being part of a board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#L00800","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1489,"content":"<p>I do not have a question but I have been listening to the debate in my office and I feel very strongly about this issue.

Local democracy is a very important ingredient in any democracy.  Some people are of the view that there has been an erosion of local democracy - \"democratic deficit\" is the phrase that is used.  Much of the thinking behind all of this restructuring took place a number of years ago during the recession when the fashion in public administration seemed to be to centralise and rationalise everything towards the centre.  As we were walking up to Leinster House today, we saw cranes everywhere and it is obvious things are beginning to change again.  People even in Senator Higgins's profession are questioning now the wisdom of doing away with the local town councils.  It sounded like a good idea at the time but people are beginning to have second thoughts about it.<\/p> <p>  It is very important to empower local communities because the energy that generates inspires volunteerism.  My colleague made a very good point that when we talk about volunteers, we are talking about highly trained people.  They are not just people who ramble in off the side of the road, sit down and start giving their opinions.  Those people have spent a lot of time attending training sessions, a point Ms Barry has made clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2017030900002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael McGuane"},{"type":"speech","time":1489053600,"counter":1492,"content":"<p>That concludes today's meeting.
