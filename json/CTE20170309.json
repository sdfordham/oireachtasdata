He is accompanied by Ms Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Marc MacSharry.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 2 March 2017.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  There are no special items that we will not deal with during the course of dealing with the agenda.<\/p> <p>  No. 3 is correspondence received since the last meeting.  We will put it on the screen.  In category A No. 328A is a briefing document from the HSE for today's meeting.  We shall note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 329A is the opening statement from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.  We shall note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers or Ministers, or both, as follow-ups on previous meetings.  Nos. 300B (i-iii) and 331B are correspondence, dated 17 February 2017 and 8 March 2017, from Mr. Maurice Quinn, Secretary General, Department of Defence.  The correspondence comprises a follow-up to his appearance before the committee on 26 January and a subsequent information request.  It was held over from last week.  Does any member wish to comment?  The second letter came last night.  It deals specifically with the maintenance cost of the Gulfstream IV aircraft.  I suggest we hold it over because we have not had time to consider it.  There is some conflicting information in the public arena on the issue.  We will come back to these two items of correspondence.<\/p> <p>  Nos. 313B and 330B are correspondence, dated 22 February 2017 and 7 March 2017, from Mr. Noel Waters, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, following up on his appearance before the committee on 2 February.  This correspondence was also held over from the last meeting.  It deals with various aspects of the restorative justice schemes.  There is a note on how many staff have been saved by the new building development programme which I think comes under the prison programme.  There is a note on PACE, as it is called.  Can we note it?  There is also information on the number of assaults on prison officers in 2016.  We asked for that information and it has come in separately.  It is the most recent letter to which I referred.  Can we note these items of correspondence and move on?  If members wish to read and use them according to their own perspectives, they may do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#B00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I asked a particular question about restorative justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#B00300","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Deputy has received her reply and is free to take and work with it once we have it published.<\/p> <p>  Category C is correspondence from private individuals or other correspondence.  No. 320C is correspondence, dated 15 February 2017, received from an individual regarding fraud allegations made by Teagasc officials.  The last committee received correspondence from this individual and subsequent replies from Teagasc.  The secretariat is working on putting the information together and will circulate it among committee members for the next meeting.  Can we agree to return to this topic at the next meeting?  It was dealt with previously.  We need to get the information given to the last Committee of Public Accounts.  I received a registered letter from the individual concerned which I passed on to the secretariat this morning.  We will come back to the general topic at next week's meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 321C is correspondence, dated 25 February 2017, from Connolly for Kids Hospital on the building of the national children's hospital.  As no date has yet been set for that meeting, we can ask the spokesperson to send a written submission, as indicated in the correspondence.  We have written to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and the Department of Health about the estimates for the project and costs incurred to date, asking in addition how it arrived at the original estimates.  Obviously, the Connolly for Kids Hospital group has contacted us.  The first thing we will do is take a written submission.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will be coming back to the issue directly.

The figures in the public domain indicate that it will be the most expensive children's hospital ever anywhere on the globe, which is absolutely shocking.  In terms of our role, we know that there is that information or speculation; therefore, we have an obligation to investigate it and make sure we get some answers.

From the health committee's perspective, it is a question of decision-making and the timelines involved.  We ought to be careful to ensure both committees will not do more or less the same thing.

The first is that the figures that have been quoted publicly in HSE forums versus the figures that are quoted here.  This is the first time these figures have ever been quoted - I have never come across them.  They do not correlate with what has been told to HSE forums, figures which have been publicly spoken about and received in the media.  I will ask questions on that.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is more interesting.  When the HSE in this response outlines the type of services that were being made available as a result of the capital expenditure, by and large, they do not exist.  If the volume of capital spending is accurate - I cannot doubt the bona fides of what has been written here - why are the services, as a result of both capital expenditures of significant money, not in place?  I visited this hospital with the current Minister and there was not a single patient there.

I will ask the secretariat to formally arrange that briefing with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser and to come back to us with a suitable time.<\/p> <p>  No. 332C, dated 8 March 2017, is from the HSE, regarding correspondence we received last week about staff of the former charity Console.  This was received late yesterday evening.  The issue here is, essentially, that there were persons working for Console who have not been paid their wages - I have not read the full details of the letter; Console has gone into liquidation, none of its debts and liabilities have been paid; and the HSE is saying that it is a section 39 agency agreement and the HSE is not legally liable for any liabilities of such organisations.  That is technically legally correct.  However, that is not good enough.  I suggest we take this matter up directly with the Minister for Health.  We cannot preside over a situation where the staff members who were working for Console do not get paid.  It may not be the HSE's legal responsibility but somebody has to pay them.

As indicated in the graph shown on the screen, the expenditure, which has remained relatively stable, involves payments to private nursing homes of approximately &euro;600 million, accounting for just under two thirds of the total, and expenditure on public nursing home costs accounting for around one third.<\/p> <p>  The nursing homes support scheme, also referred to as the fair deal scheme, was introduced in 2009.  It provides financial support to individuals deemed to be in need of nursing home care.  The scheme is cash-limited, rather than demand-led.  That means the HSE can only approve support for new applicants to the extent that its budget allocation allows.  As a result, waiting times for admission to the scheme vary over time.<\/p> <p>  Operationally, the HSE carries out a financial assessment to establish how much an individual deemed to be in need of nursing home care can contribute to the cost of his or her care.  The assessment takes into consideration both the applicant's income and assets.  An individual's contribution, which cannot exceed his or her cost of care, comprises inpatient charges up to a maximum of 80% of his or her income and up to 7.5% of the value of property assets over three years.  The HSE's inpatient charges income has remained stable at around &euro;80 million a year, and is included in the HSE's income as reflected in the annual financial statements.<\/p> <p>  Individuals who own land or residential property, including a family home, have the option to defer the associated assessed care contribution to a future date.  This option is referred to as ancillary State support or the nursing home loan.  Such loans fall due for repayment usually on the death of the individual, or the prior sale of the asset.  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for collection of the repayments, the amount of which is notified to them by the HSE.  The receipts collected are paid directly to the Exchequer.  The cumulative position in regard to nursing home loans over the period 2012 to 2015 is indicated in the following graph which is now onscreen.  The committee may wish to note that the cumulative amount the HSE notified the Revenue to recoup up to the end of 2015 was &euro;50 million.  At 31 December 2015, Revenue had collected 64% of the total amount advised to it for collection, leaving a balance outstanding at that date of &euro;17.8 million.<\/p> <p>  The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provided a legal framework for the repayment of charges that were incorrectly imposed by the former health boards on persons in long-stay care who, since 1976, had a medical card, or who were entitled to a medical card.  That included the establishment of a special fund account, separate from the HSE's financial statements, to manage the payments.  Since the establishment of the scheme, around &euro;453 million has been repaid through the account, to just over 20,000 claimants.  As the graph which is now onscreen indicates, the bulk of that was paid between 2007 and 2009.  Payments amounting to &euro;1.7 million were made in 2015.<\/p> <p>  The 2006 Act also provided for the establishment of a parallel fund account into which claimants could make a voluntary donation towards once-off improvements in public health services for dependent older persons and persons with disabilities.  Since 2007, around &euro;356,000 has been donated to the fund.  Those donations, along with any interest earned, have been paid over to long-stay units.  There was no activity on the donation fund account in 2015.<\/p> <p>  The 2006 Act also provided a framework assigning the HSE statutory responsibility for the operation of patients' private property accounts.  The funds in the accounts are held by the HSE, in trust, on behalf of individuals living in long-stay care institutions run by the HSE.  At 31 December 2015, the total value of funds held was around &euro;129 million in over 9,600 patients' private property accounts in operation in 156 care centres throughout the country.  The sum of &euro;119 million, or 92%, was being held and managed centrally by the HSE.  The remaining 8% or &euro;10 million was held and managed by local care centres, in commercial bank accounts.  Accounting records held locally record each individual patient's current balance and transactions.<\/p> <p>  The statement on internal financial control associated with the patients' private property accounts draws attention to a number of important controls in the management and operation of accounts of this nature.  The statement also sets out the actions being taken by the HSE to address control weaknesses noted by our audits, for example, the absence of required routine reconciliations, insufficient segregation of duties in some care centres due to low staff levels, and inadequate documentation by some care centres over withdrawals from patient accounts.<\/p> <p>  Note 9 of the accounts discloses that at 31 December 2015, the HSE was holding interest earned totalling around &euro;14 million which had yet to be allocated to patients.  Although a central unit was established in 2006, care centres continued to hold significant funds in local bank accounts for some time thereafter.  Interest earned during that time was not credited to individual patient accounts.  The HSE is currently in the process of examining how those funds should be allocated.<\/p> <p>  Note 8 of the accounts also discloses that prior to the establishment of the HSE, the health boards had, based on legal advice then available to them, retained interest earned on patient account balances as a contribution towards their costs incurred in managing the accounts.  Subsequent legal advice noted that they did not have the legal authority to use the funds in that way.<\/p><p>Additional funding will be required to repay these amounts, which relate to periods prior to 2005.  The total amount involved in this regard is estimated at approximately &euro;30 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":167,"content":"<p>We have three specific items on the agenda today.  They are the only items to be discussed.  There are myriad other HSE items which we will deal with another day.  However, before Mr. O'Brien makes his opening statement, I wish to make one comment to him regarding one of his previous appearances at the Committee of Public Accounts in February 2016, when we were discussing the Grace case.  On that day, I understand, he told the committee that the people who in 1996 overturned the decision to remove Grace were no longer State employees.  He went on to say, in respect of the Conal Devine report:<\/p><blockquote>From the outset of its commencement, there was close liaison with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it was always understood and intended that the report would be published and available, whatever action may be necessary.  However, since its conclusion in 2012 [that is, the report], it has not been possible to use it for that purpose, and that is why no disciplinary action has been proceeded with on foot of the Conal Devine report.<\/blockquote> <p>Media reports at the weekend indicate that the communication between the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced three years later, in 2015.  In view of the conflicting information in the public arena and what Mr. O'Brien stated at a previous Committee of Public Accounts meeting, I ask him to come back as urgently as possible, within seven days, to clarify the accuracy or otherwise of his statement to the previous Committee of Public Accounts and the reasons for, and the information he used to arrive at, his conclusions.  We will not have a debate on the matter now.  I am asking for a straight statement to correct the record.  I will not let a debate take place now.  I am not even asking Mr. O'Brien to give a reply now.

He will recall this turn of events.  I am very concerned that he has given inaccurate or misleading information to the committee in respect of the Devine report and what he claimed was a Garda insistence that reports could not be published and disciplinary actions could not be taken against HSE staff on the instruction or advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We now know because of a freedom of information, FOI, request by RTE that in fact there was no communication with the Garda for a full three years.  I am very concerned that Mr. O'Brien was not complete in the information he gave to the committee.  I am concerned also that misleading information has been given to the committee in respect of those staff who were responsible for keeping Grace in that foster home and I want him to clarify that for the committee.  Is it the case that one or all of those responsible still work within the public sector?  We need to know whether that is true.  I am concerned that the allegation - and it has not been refuted - is that what we have witnessed here is what has been described as a clique of HSE managers protecting themselves and the system at the expense of vulnerable children and young adults.  I am concerned by the allegation that records may have been tampered with or destroyed.  I am concerned above all that the public airing of this turn of events, although the turn of events itself goes back further, goes back to 2012 or 2013.  At every stage, Mr. O'Brien was at the helm of the HSE, and it strikes me that he came before the committee and gave, at the very least, incomplete information.  This does nothing to build confidence in him and in the discharge of his duties, if he does not mind my saying so.  It is not acceptable for him to come before an Oireachtas committee and behave in that way.  Therefore, unlike the Chairman, who is giving him seven days to respond to these matters, I think, given the fact that the terms of reference are being debated today in the Houses of the Oireachtas and presumably will be decided at some stage today, it is important that he answer these questions today.  The questions are why he did not give us the full story on the interaction with the Garda, why he gave a bogus explanation of disciplinary actions in respect of HSE staff and why we have been given a contradictory and muddled account as to the whereabouts of those staff members who were responsible for neglecting Grace and leaving her in that very dangerous situation.  I think he must answer these questions today.  I suspect he has all his key people with him and has the information.  I expect him to answer our questions today, answer them fully and answer them truthfully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#G00900","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>Is Mr. O'Brien in a position to respond to what has been put to him?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#G01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489050000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>As the Chairman will be aware, the clerk to the committee, presumably at the instigation of the committee, contacted our head of parliamentary affairs to indicate to us that the position would be as the Chairman outlined it.

In the interest of fair procedure, I wish to get the truth, not a quick answer.  This has been ongoing for a very long time, and it is correct that Mr. O'Brien would study closely every one of his previous statements to us on these matters.

Mr. O'Brien has said he will come back within seven days in person, if required.  The D&aacute;il will decide what happens in the D&aacute;il Chamber.

If the Chairman's ruling is as he has outlined, that is his ruling.  However, let us be absolutely honest about this: nobody should hide behind fair procedure or technicalities in the answering of these questions.  Mr. O'Brien and his team are well aware of the debate that has raged around these issues, well aware that the terms of reference are to be considered and, most likely, decided today and well aware, no doubt, from media coverage, that serious question marks have arisen regarding the evidence he has given to the committee.  Therefore, having had the pleasure of Mr. O'Brien's attendance at the committee on many occasions before, I have no doubt but that he would have anticipated this issue raising its head and that he has answers to these matters.

The Act allows the HSE to receive and hold client PPP funds, to use funds for the benefit of clients and to invest funds on clients' behalf.  The 2006 Act requires the HSE to maintain PPP accounts and to produce an annual set of financial statements for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Act also places restrictions on the HSE as to how it can invest PPP funds.  Such funds must be invested with a financial institution regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland or with the National Treasury Management Agency.  As part of the suite of national financial regulations, NFRs, maintained by the HSE to document the system of internal financial control, the HSE has implemented NFR 22 &ndash; patients' private property, which along with a set of patients' private property guidelines, provide detailed instructions to HSE staff on the management of client funds.<\/p> <p>  The HSE established a national co-ordinating unit for PPP, the PPP account central unit, or the central unit, in late 2006.<\/p><p>The central unit received all payments from the health repayment scheme in respect of payments made to clients' PPP accounts.  Department of Social Protection allowances and pensions, approximately 2,500 of them, are also received by the PPPA central unit weekly and lodged to each client's central PPP account.  The weekly statutory contribution pertaining to each client is deducted and moneys are provided for each client to their local care centre as requested depending on client usage.  Excess PPP funds from individual care centres are also transferred to the central unit where those funds can attract interest.  In effect the local care centre PPP account is a current account and the central unit account is a deposit account.<\/p><p> The operation of the PPP process at local level in the 156 units and at central level is subject to external audit by a firm of accountants and there is also an overall audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The HSE has in place a clear programme of work to address the issues arising from these audits.<\/p><p> The PPP system currently supports more than 6,000 adults across older persons, disability and mental health services, with various levels of vulnerability and dependency, to safeguard their moneys and assist with the spending of those moneys for their direct benefit only.  It is an important service for the client but also for family members.<\/p><p> Turning to the health repayment scheme, the 2006 Act was enacted in June 2006 to provide a legal basis for the repayment of long-stay charges for inpatient services which were wrongfully imposed on eligible persons since 1976 under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.  The repayment scheme applies to eligible residents of public long-stay facilities and public contracted beds who were wrongfully charged at the time.<\/p><p> In accordance with the Health (Repayments Scheme) Act 2006, a repayments scheme (donations) fund was set up by the HSE for the purposes of providing improvements in public health services for dependent older persons and persons with disabilities.  Projects undertaken must be once-off improvements and must not incur expenses which would, in the ordinary course of the provision of such public health services, have otherwise been expenses met by an allocation from the Minister for Finance or another Minister of the Government.  Donations received are allocated to the institution or service specified by the donor, subject to the above conditions.<\/p><p> Governance arrangements are in place to ensure that the funds from this donations account are allocated and spent in accordance with the terms of the Act.  The Health Service Executive submits detailed annual accounts of the fund and these accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Interim and regular reports on income and expenditure on the account are available as required.<\/p><p> Since the scheme commenced, a total of 212 donations have been made to date, and the value of donations received from the scheme is &euro;348,000.  All of these funds have now been allocated and expended for their intended purposes and there are no funds in the account at the end of 2016.  As there is a possibility of further payments to be made under the scheme, it is the HSE's view that the donations account must remain in operation until there is a final close of the scheme.<\/p><p> With regard to the health repayment scheme itself, up to the end of December 2016 a total of 35,463 applications have been received.  While the scheme closed to new claimants on the 31 December 2007, there are instances that allow for a follow-on claim to be made.  All 35,463 applications received have been concluded by the end of December 2016 with 21,877 applicants receiving an offer and a further 13,586 applications not accepted.  Based on the 2016 preliminary outturn, a total of 20,283 payments amounting to &euro;453.046 million have been made under the scheme.  <\/p><p> The final cost of the scheme will be in the region of &euro;486 million.  A timeframe for close down of the scheme has yet to be agreed.  The Department of Health in conjunction with the HSE's national co-ordinating unit for the health repayment scheme is currently reviewing the level of potential claims remaining and considering measures necessary to bring the scheme to a closure, including any legislative revisions that may be required.<\/p><p> The nursing homes support scheme is administered by the HSE in accordance with the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  The scheme is administered centrally, with a 2017 net budget of &euro;940 million, and payments in respect of the costs associated with the scheme are made on a named resident basis across public, voluntary and private providers.  The contributions determined under the scheme for individuals are paid directly to the public, private and voluntary providers and the income contributions for those in public centres is included in the revenue income and expenditure accounts of the HSE. <\/p><p> The scheme supported 23,073 people at year-end 2015, rising to 23,142 at year-end 2016.  Of the 23,142 in 2016, 79% are supported in private or voluntary centres and the remaining 21% are supported through public provision. <\/p><p> The briefing paper submitted to the committee outlines in some detail the reasons there are different costs associated with public and private residential care provision under the scheme.  The HSE published its cost of care for public residential care centres in October 2016, with a range of costs generally from &euro;884 to &euro;2,089 per bed per week, when compared with private residential care costs which range from &euro;695 to &euro;1,325 per bed per week.  While this is a significant cost differential for long-stay residential care beds, there are also quite specific different drivers of these costs in evidence. <\/p><p> These include pay rates and conditions of employment of public versus private; the environmental implications of staffing levels in older public centres; the reduction in public beds since 2009 to comply with residential care standards; fixed costs that cannot be easily reduced in line with reductions in bed numbers; higher dependency of residents in public centres; and the necessity to provide public residential care in areas not attractive to private providers.<\/p><p> It is also important to note that public residential care centres are well respected and a vital component of their local community in terms of the delivery of a wide range of services, not just long-stay care.  Many centres are campuses for the delivery of local services, including primary care, day services and rehabilitation.  Public residential care services have a long history of service provision going back generations and the capital plan as announced in 2016 outlined a series of developments across the country in terms of both replacement and refurbishment of existing accommodation to bring the remaining centres in line with the residential care standards.  This will see a significant reduction in multi-occupancy bedrooms, and allow for the provision of services in line with privacy and dignity requirements for residents.<\/p><p> In April 2015, additional funding was provided within an overall package of &euro;74 million to reduce the waiting list for funding approval under the NHSS to no more than a four-week period.  This has been maintained consistently since then and it has provided an essential stability in the overall context of the provision of service to people who require long-term care.<\/p><p> While the NHSS is a significant scheme in supporting older people who need long-term residential care services, it also needs to be viewed in the context of the services that are required to maintain people in their own homes and communities for as long as appropriate.  These services include home care, day care, respite, rehabilitation, voluntary and community supports.  The input of paid and unpaid carers, family and neighbours are important elements of the necessary supports.<\/p><p> The HSE is implementing the recommendations for which it is responsible, following the review of the nursing homes support scheme undertaken in 2015 and will work with the Department of Health in relation to the value-for-money review to be undertaken this year in relation to the costs of public long-stay care services.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>The first speaker is Deputy McDonald to be followed by Deputy Madigan.

There are some patients who have capacity and neither need nor want us to mind their patient private property - their own funds.  That is entirely okay with the HSE; it is not a service that we seek to provide.  It is, however, one that we have to provide for some patients and families.  It is quite an extensive service.  We seek to safeguard patients' moneys when they are in our care, particularly those who would not have capacity.  We provide a service which effectively allows them to have their bills paid, have their social welfare money collected, where applicable, and which discharges the contribution that the State requires them to give to the provider, as well as providing their own \"for patient comfort\" moneys or moneys for their own use.  Our guidelines are very explicit.  We make it very clear that this is the patient's money.  If patients want to manage their money themselves and have capacity, that is entirely at their discretion.  Our assumption is that people do have capacity unless there is a reason to doubt it.  That is the why.  We only do it where it is necessary or asked for.  It is not something we insist on.<\/p> <p>  In terms of why we have to pay interest now, in the health board days, the advice the health boards had was that, when they were doing this patient private property service as a service of last resort, their legal relationship to the patient was such that the patient would give the health board some money, and the health board minded the money and gave it back to the patient.  The advice was that the health boards did not have to give interest.  The interest was retained by the health boards to partly offset the costs of providing what is quite an extensive service.  At the time, it was offered in over 170 centres.<\/p> <p>  In around 2004 or 2005, these issues were becoming very topical.  The HSE was on the way in.  As part of the overall preparation for that change, we got further legal advice which said actually, on balance, the relationship is more likely to be that of a trustee.  Trustees are obliged, not just to give back the &euro;100 that was given to them for safekeeping, but also to give interest if it is earned.  We set about putting that in place.  We established a central patient private property unit for data gathering and a repayment scheme.  We have a backlog, in this first instance, of approximately four years' worth of interest, from 2005 to 2008.  We now need to repay this money to patients or, in most cases, to their entitled next of kin.  That is a big logistical exercise and, unfortunately, in many cases we will struggle to find an entitled next of kin.  There is a large piece of work under way to achieve the first two parts of that, namely, the data gathering and calculating the interest. That is to be undertaken this year, I believe.  It will take at least to the end of next year or possibly longer to figure out whom can we pay the money back to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#OO00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Mulvany"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":631,"content":"<p>The &euro;14.4 million in interest sounds like an awful lot of money.

As I said, our intent is to get this paid.  The HSE does not want to hold this money.  Our preference would have been to have got to it earlier.

Over the 29 years from 1976 until then, the average interest across all these accounts - remember there are about 18,000 to 20,000 accounts - was less than &euro;1 million per year.  As soon as the charge was suspended in December 2004, patients no longer were making contributions to the cost of their care and the value of money in their accounts went up significantly.  Part of our response was to try to reduce any risk, by bringing money from the local centres into a central point where we could better manage it and give better support to the 170 local centres.  To do something well across 170 centres with all the complexities, particularly when we are talking about deceased patients and probate - it is much better to do the complex stuff centrally.  We established a system in that central unit that gives interest to the accounts automatically when it is earned.  It is a very robust system and is separate from the HSE's accounts.

We will not leave a difference that has an impact on the patient private property accounts because we treat that money as separate and belonging to the patients.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald also asked about the likely 2016 balance.

A system has been in place for years.  An external firm is contracted every year separate from the HSE to audit all 150 or so centres.  It physically attends a large sample and produces a financial statement.  It gives us a list of control breaches.  It also prepares the overall patient private property account which is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Having gone through approximately 70% of the work on the control breaches, my sense is that there are strong controls in place.  No system of control is perfect and cannot be improved, but this one is strong, given how dispersed it is.  More than 90% of the money in question is not in local centres where it is more difficult to exercise control, rather it is in the central unit, the audits of which have never raised a significant issue.

The cost of their employment is lower in these facilities.  That is one part of the equation.  The other part that adds to the difference is the relative complexity of the needs of patients in public nursing homes, where there tends to be a more dependent blend of high to low acuity.  That is not to say some private nursing homes do not also provide for high needs, but typically there is more of that blend in a public nursing home.  That influences the blend of staffing provided.  Typically, there is a richer blend of nursing staff and so on in high-dependency public nursing homes which drives cost.

The breakdown of people being provided for under the scheme has 80% in private institutions and 20% in HSE institutions.  In the past couple of years, a couple of hundred beds have come out of the system and there is no great plan to increase numbers dramatically; there may even be a few more restrictions, depending on the refurbishments that must take place.  With the increasing population, it seems as if the 80:20 split will head to 90% private and 10% public.  The HSE must have done some projections on that.  The executive is not increasing its capacity but the population is increasing.  If the HSE is not providing the extra capacity, it will go to the private sector.  Where does the delegation see the split going if it is now at 80:20?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#RR01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1489050000,"counter":713,"content":"<p>There are two components to the issue.  The first is a slightly bigger discussion that we have touched on, which is that we need, over time, to provide for a wider and more sustainable scheme aimed at providing the supports to which many people would prefer to have access to remain living in their own homes and communities rather than in residential nursing care.  This is a discussion we have had with the committee discussing the future of health care.  We also spoke to that committee about the overall capital envelope for the health sector.  As was referenced, a little tangentially, in 2008, before the music stopped, so to speak, we were on track for a level of capital infrastructure development that was double the rate that has occurred in the mean time due to the inability to fund it.  We have put forward very strongly the notion that we must get back to that earlier trajectory, and if we did so we would certainly be looking at the blend of public-private nursing home facilities.<\/p> <p>  There are two reasons for this.  The first is the figure of 21% for public facilities, which is probably as low as we would wish it to go.  There is a requirement for the particular type of care that those facilities can provide that is not as well provided elsewhere.  Additionally, we are the provider of last resort, called upon in circumstances where the regulator is effectively revoking the licence of private providers.  In order to be able to do that, we need to retain a certain core ability from which to call upon to manage those facilities.  Those combined factors, combined with demographic change, mean we are of the view that the total bed stock would need to change.  Under the Department of Health, led by the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, there is an overall capacity review being undertaken this year.  It is often referred to as a hospital capacity review but it is not; it is a system capacity review that will examine bed capability in all sectors.  Our view is we need more beds outside the acute sector.  We may need some in the acute sector but the preponderance should be outside the acute sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017030900002#RR01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1489050000,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I get the point.

While other committees are probably examining the issue, it is important that we have an understanding of the full picture.  That is all I am suggesting in this regard.<\/p> <p>  On the nursing home support scheme, the document provided refers at paragraph 4.3 to the determination of the costs of care.  Services not funded under the nursing home support scheme include incontinence wear, chiropody, ophthalmic and dental services.  Surely old people are entitled to have incontinence wear and chiropody covered under the scheme?  Their nails grow and if they are being looked after in an institution, they are entitled to chiropody services.  If an old person needs a new set of false teeth, the cost is not covered.  I will link that issue with people in the institutions who are on medical cards because some of these services are covered by medical cards when the person is living at home.  The medical cards of persons who move into a residential institution become almost redundant.  They are given bed, board and care and nothing else is readily available from the private providers.  Some things that should be covered under a medical card do not seem to be covered.

We are considering the Revised Estimates for 2017 of the Public Expenditure and Reform Vote group.  I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for financial services, e-Government and public procurement, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  On 15 December 2016, the D&aacute;il ordered that the following Revised Estimates be referred to this committee for consideration: Vote 11 - Public Expenditure and Reform, Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, Vote 14 - State Laboratory, Vote 15 - Secret Service, Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service, Vote 18 - National Shared Services Office, Vote 19 - Office of the Ombudsman, and Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement.  I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and their accompanying officials.  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the Revised Estimates and the supplementary performance information regarding the outputs and impacts of programme expenditure.

I will speak briefly on my overall Vote before facilitating as many questions as possible.  As the Chair has said, this Vote group comprises the Votes for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Office of Government Procurement and the National Shared Services Office; the Votes for the offices under the aegis of my Department, which are the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service and the Office of the Ombudsman; and the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances, which covers Civil Service pensions, and the Secret Service.  The Vote for the remaining element of the Public Expenditure and Reform group - the Office of Public Works - is handled separately by this committee.<\/p> <p> The structure of this Vote remains unchanged in 2017.  There are two strategic programmes, one focusing on public expenditure and sectoral policy and the other focusing on public service management and reform.  The requested staffing and funding resources for each programme are set out in the third part of the Estimate.  With regard to the objective of the first of the two programmes, the select committee will be aware that the timetable envisaged by the Government for the 2018 Estimates process includes a spending review in advance of the budget.  While moderate and sustainable expenditure growth is planned over the medium term, there are emerging and competing public service demands.  It is intended that the spending review process will help to broaden the Government's options during the budgetary process by creating fiscal space to fund new policies from within existing ceilings through a systemic review of the existing cost base.<\/p> <p>  In parallel with this approach, my Department will continue to work on planning the capital review, which will be concluded later this year.  The objective of the capital review is to provide a focused analysis of capital spending and to outline what can realistically be delivered over the remainder of the plan utilising the additional resources that are now available.  The increase in gross expenditure on the Public Expenditure and Reform Vote for 2017 will bring the total gross allocation to &euro;56 million.  This additional allocation will provide for cross-Government measures and is driven by a number of factors such as the progress of the Government's commitments under the public service ICT strategy, the advancement of Civil Service learning and development, the facilitation of an electronic exchange of information between the State and the EU Commission, the implementation of the single public service pension scheme across the public service, the development of the Government's economic and evaluation service and the work of the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p> <p>  I would like to reflect briefly on the future of public service reform so that we can continue to focus on improving services.  Two successive plans have been delivered by my Department over the past five years.  They have enabled us to maintain and improve services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets.  Between 2009 and 2014, the Exchequer pay bill was reduced by over a fifth and staff numbers were reduced by a third.  These reforms were implemented at a time of increased demand for many essential public services, such as welfare payments, medical cards, school places and pensions.  In December 2016, I was pleased to see many positive messages about how our public services are performing by comparison with such services in other countries.  According to the Institute of Public Administration's public service trends report for 2016, our public administration is the most professional and least politicised in the 28 EU member states.  Our public service is considered one of the least bureaucratic in Europe.  We also scored highly for the quality of our public administration and in the rating of perceptions that Government decisions are effectively administered.<\/p> <p>  We are continually looking for ways to improve customer experiences.  Last month, my Department published a survey of business customers of the Civil Service.  The survey was carried out to meet a commitment in the public service reform plan.  I am pleased that levels of satisfaction with the service received and the outcome of the business interaction have improved by over 15% since the last survey in 2009.  It is not surprising to note that the way business engages with the Civil Service is changing fundamentally.  Some 83% of businesses now interact via online services, compared to just 33% in 2009.  This helps how we plan for the future.<\/p><p> Work is now under way on a survey of Irish public customers and will assess satisfaction with, and perceptions of, services provided to the public by the Civil Service.  My Department is currently engaging across the public service on the preparation of the next phase of reform to cover the period from 2017 to 2020.  The draft plan will then be informed by a period of public consultation in the spring, with a view to publication by mid-2017.  In addition, I published a second progress report on Civil Service renewal in July.  I again invite members to provide input into the Department's general plans on public service renewal.<\/p><p> I will now turn briefly to the issue of public service pay.  I have outlined that the Government will take a two-phased approach.  We have now completed phase one and the additional spending arising from the Government decision in respect of the anomaly payment for those staff within the Lansdowne Road agreement, aside from members of the Garda, is a one-off cost of &euro;120 million in 2017.  The required funds must be met from available public resources while taking into account the scope for reallocation of expenditure and continuing to meet the Government's commitment to core public services.  The Government will monitor the position closely and will consider how best to meet any additional funding requirements where the need arises.<\/p><p> We are now beginning phase two, during which we hope to negotiate a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement.  Before we begin those negotiations, we await the report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The commission&rsquo;s role is to provide evidence-based objective analysis and as I have argued this morning, I believe strongly that a collective approach to public service pay is vital to our national interest and never more so than at a time of international flux.  Collective agreements deliver public service reform, secure productivity improvements and allow for planning.  They allow us to balance pay increases in the public service with other priorities like education, housing and the issues debated in the House last night.<\/p><p> In addition to progress in public service reform, I continue to be committed to political reform and real progress has been made in this year.  An area of current focus will be the general scheme for a data sharing and governance Bill and the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015, which I aim to bring to Committee Stage by April.  In addition, my Department has undertaken the first review of the operation of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 and of the system for State board appointments.  I will publish both of these reports shortly.<\/p><p> Turning now to the other Votes, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has responsibility in respect of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  Members will aware that procurement reform is an important element of the Government&rsquo;s overall approach to reform.  In this regard, the net allocation for the OGP in 2017 is estimated at &euro;19.96 million, compared with &euro;19.982 million in 2016.  In the four years to the end of 2016, the OGP and its partner sector sourcing organisations in health, education, local government and defence had enabled cost reduction savings of the order of &euro;300 million.  Total cost reduction savings for 2017 are between &euro;80 million and &euro;100 million and this represents a very significant portion of overall Government spending.  By putting in place procurement arrangements, the aim is to achieve economies of scale and maximum value for money while balancing other requirements, including societal considerations and SME access.<\/p><p> Members also will be aware that the National Shared Services Office within my Department is leading the shared services strategy within the overall reform and renewal context.  We are making good progress across all aspects of this reform agenda.  The Civil Service HR and pensions administration shared service centre, PeoplePoint, now provides services for 34,500 civil servants from 39 public service bodies.  The payroll shared service centre, PSSC, has 103,000 payees, of whom 57,000 are pensioners, from 43 different Government organisations.  The financial management shared services project has begun the development of a new finance technology solution for the Government.  The introduction of this single finance technology platform will replace 31 existing finance systems across Departments and offices and will facilitate transaction processing in the finance shared service centre.  This is why a provision of &euro;45.173 million is sought for Vote 18 and these projects which, by their nature, require a certain amount of upfront investment. <\/p><p> Vote 12, for superannuation and retired allowances, primarily provides for pension and retirement lump sum costs for civil servants, including prison officers, and pension payments for dependants.  Year-to-year variation in expenditure on this Vote is primarily driven by the number of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age and whose years of service and grade and pay level are variable and uncertain.<\/p><p> The Estimate I am proposing today, involving a net provision of &euro;359.9 million, represents a decrease of some &euro;32 million or an 8% drop on the 2016 net Estimate.  This decrease in provision is largely attributable to an increase in contributions from the single public service pension scheme.<\/p><p> The committee has been supplied with details of various other Votes but I will leave it at that for now.  I commend the 2017 Estimates to the select committee and I will be happy to answer any questions which may arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#A01100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":837,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening remarks and now call on Deputy Sherlock to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#B00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":838,"content":"<p>I thank the Minster and his officials for attending today's meeting.

I imagine the vast bulk of them are legal costs which accrue to legal practices.  Has the Minister given any thought to the idea that we need to find some mechanism whereby truth and justice are sought and reported on in a way that does not put such a burden on the taxpayer?  I take the point the Minister may make about the relatively recent referendum and so on but I do not believe that the Irish taxpayer wants to continue to bear these costs, particularly if they are, in the main, legal costs.

Alongside this, the issue of cost must be considered.  For this very reason, the House, this Government and the previous Government developed the concept of commissions of inquiry and investigation.  They offer a different way of dealing with the kinds of truths we are debating and they have brought a different level of predictability and control to costs that the taxpayer may face.  It is incumbent on all of us - and this is the attitude that has been shown by colleagues here - to be aware that as we consider the form of inquiry that is necessary, we are also conscious of issues that will develop in the future regarding how we conduct inquiries.  This is a matter on which the Comptroller and Auditor General has already commented.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said in a report in 2008, \"The State faces a considerable challenge to achieve predictability and financial control in the case of tribunals of inquiry which operate under the authority of the legislature without compromising their independent investigations or the constitutional rights of witnesses.\"  This points to a challenge we have, that is, even if we do all the work we can on issues such as rates payable to legal counsel, once the Oireachtas makes a decision on the setting up of an independent commission of inquiry or a tribunal, parties to that then have rights that they will seek to have vindicated.  We then must trust, as we do, a person of standing in our State to make decisions about the conduct of that commission, which invests in him or her an independence.  Alongside this, my Department will do all it can, as will the Department of Justice and Equality, to ensure that this work is done in an affordable and sustainable way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#C00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I take the point the Minister makes.  Ultimately, it is the Minister's Department that will sign the cheque, or through which the cheque will come, regarding the fees structure and the entirety of the costs.  Lest there be any ambiguity about my position on this, let me state that the right to have one's rights vindicated and be represented legally is absolutely sacrosanct, and I think we would all agree with that.  However, is there a process by which costs can be capped while recognising the rights of all parties before a commission of investigation or a tribunal of inquiry?  Going back to the 2008 report, it seems that if the Comptroller and Auditor General is acknowledging the spiralling costs - at the risk of putting words into his mouth - then those costs are out of control.  They are astronomical and ridiculous as regards the pursuit of justice or truth, depending on the content of the inquiry.  The Irish taxpayer has the right to ensure that the most cost-effective mechanism is used, even if this means legislating for an upper cap on costs per hour or whatever formula is used to determine costs.  I put it to the Minister that it is not possible for the Irish taxpayer to sustain over ten years a cost of &euro;420.593 million.  There needs to be a policy shift somewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#C00300","speaker":"1276"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":844,"content":"<p>Regarding commissions of inquiry, we have structures in place to deal with the matter of legal costs.

That was a decision and a statement he made and one I certainly welcome.  My Department will fulfil its role as best as possible - along with the Department of Justice - in dealing with the issue of cost.  However, I wish to make one point in this regard, and I do so again in the spirit of acknowledging the need to interrogate the truth about very important matters.  This is an issue of which Deputy Brendan Howlin, Deputy Sherlock's party leader, would have been aware.  Deputy Howlin previously held my position and it was he who introduced the legislation on commissions of inquiry.  As was his right, Deputy Howlin called for a tribunal of inquiry in this instance in light of everything we have learned.  This is why I believe tribunals of inquiry should be used carefully.

In the former, they can amount to tens of millions of euro per year.  My recollection is that across the coming years and across all of the PPPs that we have delivered, the accumulated value of the bullet payments is between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion.  Those payments are spread over a longer time period which is why PPPs are attractive but, as I said earlier, we need to be really careful with them.

This will ensure that as we go through the negotiation process, dealing with the terms of the exit and the terms of any new arrangements, there will be clarity for financial services firms as to where we are going.  The international financial services sector is the plumbing and architecture that is underneath most economies, in terms of finance for small and medium enterprises - not just those enterprises that export and trade but also those with a domestic focus.  We must make sure that as we go through this process there is not too much volatility for them to face that might disrupt their businesses, if, for example, the negotiations do not go well in a particular week.

I also raised my concerns around regulatory arbitrage or competition happening in the European space at the moment as people vie to attract business from London.  I stressed the importance of not lowering standards in any part of the Single Market because given the current interconnectedness, there would be a spillover if a company of significance were to move to a jurisdiction on a promise that could not be delivered.  I discussed that with the Commissioner and with members of the ECON committee.  <\/p> <p>  I presented a paper on risks and opportunities to the Brexit Cabinet sub-committee in November 2016.  So far this year I have had a number of consultations here and in London with different sectors to make sure we are across all the risks and opportunities.  There is a potential opportunity for job creation, that is true.  I spoke about that yesterday in the wake of one announcement of a company in the insurance sector that is not coming here.  There will be an ebb and flow to this.  Jobs will relocate out of London; they will not all come to Ireland but we will get more than our fair share, in my view.

IFS2020 has a target of increasing our offering by 30%, or approximately 10,000 jobs, over a five-year period.  According to last year's figures, the current figure is just under 40,000.  As we increase the number further, I am committed to maintaining at least one third of the overall number outside of Dublin.  That is important.<\/p> <p>  As we came off the back of the summer months last year, we understood that businesses would not wait for the Article 50 process to begin.  Some knew that the time horizons for relocating - the application process and moving staff across - would take longer than the two-year period.  We continue to work with many uncertainties, but businesses like certainty.  When they undertook due diligence exercises prior to the referendum result, many noticed benefits in consolidating their various business arrangements in different parts of Europe.  Ireland figured strongly in certain regards.<\/p> <p>  As we approached the end of the year, it became clear to us that they were going to start making decisions in the first half of this year.  That has happened.  I must be careful about managing expectations, though.  At yesterday's Brexit Cabinet sub-committee, I spoke about some of the positive decisions that had been made in our favour only to find out afterwards that one of those had gone against us.  That will happen; there will be an ebb and flow.<\/p> <p>  We cannot yet put a number on the companies.  In Davos, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, referred to there being more than 100 expressions of interest to the IDA.  In the insurance field alone, I understand that the Central Bank has received five to ten applications for authorisation and a further 20 companies are at the pre-application stage.<\/p> <p>  It is difficult for us to discuss the exact number of companies for a couple of reasons.  Some will choose Ireland.  They will make that decision with their boards in the coming months and submit their applications.  Others will choose Ireland as a contingency that they do not need to trigger until much later in the process, so the number is difficult to know.  One Asian bank that I have dealt with decided that Dublin would be its gateway into the Single Market.  That is the play that we have been making strongly into Asia.  The bank's initial figure was in the teens, which was good considering the bank in question, but having monitored the situation as it has developed, that number will grow.  If such companies cannot put a number on it, though, neither can I.  There is significant interest and we are working everyday to ensure that we are across it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#F01100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I wish to ask the Minister of State about Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement and the frameworks that have been put in place.

The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, is a new entity and has done a tremendous amount of work in a short period, but we must continually review what we are doing and get feedback.<\/p> <p>  I will have to discuss Cork again.  I visited it with the OGP as part of the work that we were doing through Deputies and Senators in each constituency.  I chair an advisory group of business firms' representatives - the Small Firms Association, the Construction Industry Federation and so on.  Something that we decided as part of an outreach programme was to use Members in their constituencies, given that they speak with small businesses week in, week out about their procurement concerns.  We decided to go on a roadshow and, through political offices and the chambers, invited them to meetings where we could explain what the OGP had been doing in recent years, give advice on using eTenders and so on, and take questions and feedback.  We did that in UCC in December.  A number of businesses attended that positive engagement.  It was important for me to hear directly their feedback about some of the problems that they had been experiencing, given that second guessing our officials is an important role that every Minister must play in terms of undertaking a critical analysis of our functions.  We have just had a meeting in Galway.  It was very good, with even more businesses in attendance.  We are planning for meetings in Mayo and Sligo in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  While we must keep reforming this space, it is important to note that 95% of the State's goods and services are procured from Irish-based companies, with the majority being SMEs.  However, we still do not have the right way of qualifying an SME.  We are working to European standards, which refer to 250 employees or less.  When we discuss SMEs, though, most of us are not talking about a company that is so large.  One of the pieces of work that we are undertaking with industry is determining how to get figures for micro-enterprises - companies of ten or 20 people - that feel like they are losing out to some of the new procurement processes that we introduced.  We lot contracts together before breaking them back down again by regions, but enterprises might not be aware of that.  In one industry, the average tender might only have been &euro;20,000, which would be below the &euro;25,000 threshold, but because the OGP decided to lump contracts together, enterprises were not aware, did not receive notifications, were not registered on eTenders and missed out.  We now have metrics in place to improve this situation, but the main purpose of my outreach in each constituency is to let small businesses know that matters have changed.  This does not mean that they have to lose out.  We must be mindful that we work in a Single Market.  While trying to favour SMEs, we cannot shut out other European companies.  However, it is also worth noting - I can get the committee the exact figures - that we do better from procurement in other European countries than companies from those countries do from procurement in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2017030900002#F01300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1489057800,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke to Deputy Sherlock about the public service commission, which is ongoing, and how he envisages its timeline.

Let us do something good and stop any abuse by other means.  I worked on a project which qualified for the research and development tax credit and it is not as easy as the Deputy might think to reassess and resubmit for the scheme.  It is difficult to qualify and, provided the criteria are sufficiently tight and rigorous, abuses should be prevented.  Repeat inventions do not qualify and submitting the same thing again with a few tweaks is not sufficient to be rare, non-obvious or novel.

We will move through this and some of the other amendments that cover some of the same ground.  There is no doubt that we need to encourage innovation.  We should support innovators.  I am not convinced that giving tax breaks to companies is the best way to support innovation, which is why I opposed the Bill in the first instance.  Every cent lost in tax revenue is money that could potentially be going to the universities.<\/p> <p>  We have a choice.  Do we go the private route in supporting and encouraging innovation or do we take the public route?  We could even provide grants to small producers, which might be more helpful to them.  The biggest problem for small operations or individuals trying to develop something new is not tax but having a bit of money to do the research and development and develop an idea rather than a tax break on the revenue they generate once they have it up and running.  My fear is that this is not the best way to achieve the Bill's stated objective.  The unintended - possibly intended - consequence is providing another mechanism for profitable corporations to pay less tax.  Obviously, there is a context for that because big questions arise regarding the extent of the tax being paid by corporations.  Even people who might disagree with my perspective on these would accept that there are questions to be answered following the Apple case.  Just looking at the revenue figures of corporation tax take as against pre-tax profits, dividing one by the other does not give 12.5%, but about 6%.  That is the effective rate of tax being paid at the moment.  As we know, for some companies it is considerably less because most domestic small and medium-sized enterprises are paying 12.5%.  If the average is 6%, it means that a small number of very profitable companies are paying very little.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#J00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1018,"content":"<p>The office referred to in the Bill only looks at the criteria for patentability.

There is the PTRLA, the funding for researchers in universities.  A lot of that is on the other end of it as well.  I have met many of them throughout the country and the last thing on their mind is whether they will get a tax break out of this.  They are already being funded to do the research developments in 12 dedicated research centres throughout the country and in universities.  I know that is not totally relevant to what the Deputy is saying.<\/p> <p>  Inevitably, some of those people when they leave university start to develop something themselves.

One of the things that would happen is that Revenue would examine this matter through tax queries.  The responsibility would fall to Revenue.  This is only my view but if that were to be the case - I cannot say that it will not be the case - and if a bigger company set up smaller subsidiaries or companies and they encouraged employment, productivity and a turnover, it would be very difficult for anyone in government to say he or she thinks this big company is setting up a couple of minnows so that it can claim tax.  All that the Government and the Department could do on that would be to make sure that all relevant documentation and monetary evaluation of the larger company, and the smaller companies associated with it, would be dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  This legislation is due to be debated again on 29 March by which time Deputy Boyd Barrett may have tabled an amendment on this matter.  The Revenue Commissioners can examine this matter through transfer pricing.  Under EU legislation transfer pricing is illegal.  It would be difficult under the present EU legislation for companies to do as the Deputy has suggested.  I am not saying it is impossible, knowing how some companies could react.  There is sufficient EU legislation to deal with this matter.  There are measures associated with Revenue and the EU.  We should be careful about this matter.  How would we examine a mother company that may have set up three or four SMEs or three smaller companies to maybe benefit the mother company?  Where would be bring in legislation to counteract such activity?  How can we stop this happening if it is inevitable that these companies were going to create jobs and generate a turnover every year that would benefit an economy?<\/p><p>I take the point, but I do not know how this could be dealt with legally.

Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith and Richard Boyd Barrett propose to specify in the Bill a number of additional reporting requirements.  Section 18(2) provides that the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on activities under the KDB certification scheme will include information on such matters as the Minister may direct.  In addition, section 18(4)(h) provides for a wide-ranging and catch-all provision which permits the Minister to request the inclusion of such other statistical information as he or she prescribes.  I am satisfied that the combination of these two catch-all provisions neatly provides a sound basis for the Minister to request the inclusion in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of statistical information in a format he or she may decide.<\/p><p>For example, this could include the type of information that the Deputies have an interest in such as statistics on the breakdown of the knowledge development box, KDB, applications on a geographical or sectoral basis.  I refer here to any part of the State.  It has the benefit of providing the Minister with the ability to seek statistical information on whatever basis he or she sees fit.  I believe there is an inherent danger in being overly prescriptive in legislation.  Good legislation would provide a sound basis for ensuring that the Minister gets the information he or she wants at a particular point in time and at any time, rather than adopting an overly prescriptive approach in the content of the actual KDB report.  In my view it should be allowed to evolve in response to emerging developments and to be able to respond to new requirements.  The Bill provides a sound basis for this.  I assure Deputies that it has been the practice of the Comptroller and Auditor General, in this annual report on the activities of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, to provide a very rich account of activities and to include statistics, county by county.  This is in line with providing good customer service where flexibility is a key response to changing requirements.  In other words, throughout all of this the Minister and his Department can intervene, can continuously get reports on how this scheme is operating and can make interventions based on the information he or she will require, for the benefit of the taxpayer and to ensure all the points made by Deputy Boyd-Barrett are adhered to and that there is no abuse of the scheme.  It would be a folly on any Minister not to do that and have these measures in place.  I know the Deputy opposes the Bill in its entirety but this was specifically put in to address the points raised by the Deputy.  What would we do otherwise; do we set up a forum or a committee? We must have some faith in the Comptroller and Auditor General.  All of this still comes back to the Minister's office which, at any stage, has the right to check and go through the process county by county if needed to see that legislation is being adhered to.  If I was sitting in opposition I would look at this as being very reasonable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#L03300","speaker":"1351","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>I will not labour the point I have made.  I thank Deputy Rock for endorsing the spirit of the amendments.  While I have no doubt about how conscientious the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan might be in these matters, future Ministers may not be so conscientious.  It is helpful for the Minister to have information that breaks down who it is that benefits from a particular measure or from the tax benefit for these companies.  It would be helpful if Ministers, others who are not Ministers and for the public to have access to that information so they can assess whether they think this is a good measure and whether the tax benefits conferred are value for money for the public, as against the value of other measures.<\/p> <p>  The area of corporate tax is, to put it mildly, opaque.  There are a lot of tax breaks out there.  I know that pertains to Revenue but when one gets this certificate then one is going to get the tax break and the two things are connected.  I do not have the figures to hand but it is worth saying, and I said it on Second Stage, gross pre-tax profits in Ireland for corporations are in the region of &euro;95 billion.  By the time we take out all the allowable allowances, deductions and tax breaks, the &euro;95 billion goes down to around &euro;65 billion in taxable income.  That is in the region of &euro;30 billion to &euro;40 billion worth of loopholes, tax breaks, incentives, deductions, allowances or whatever one wants to call them.  I believe the public and the public representatives need to have more information about these in order to understand them.  They need to be transparent and readily available.

It might be useful to remind Deputies of the intention behind the Bill.  It is the introduction of the KDB certification scheme for SMEs to be administered by the Patents Office.  The process before the office involves the examination of the application to ensure that the invention the subject of the application meets the criteria of being novel, non-obvious and useful.  If an application meets these criteria, the office will grant a certificate.  If not, it will not issue one.  The certificate provides the gateway for small to medium enterprises to apply for the 6.25% corporate tax rate on profits arising from the invention.  The grant of the certificate does not, however, guarantee that an SME will qualify for the lower rate of corporation tax.  I am saying all this because I did not get an opportunity to say it in the D&aacute;il.  Revenue will consider tax returns on the basis of the provisions applying to the KDB scheme, which was introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act 2015 and which came into effect in January 2016.  Revenue will always have the ability to obtain necessary information on the KDB in order to provide reliable information in return to the Government, particularly the Department of Finance, on the use of the KDB, including information on revenue foregone by the Exchequer.  That is very interesting.<\/p><p>I understand the Deputies' desire to ensure monitoring and evaluation of the existing schemes in the research, enterprise and taxation areas.  It is, of course, necessary to protect taxpayers' money to ensure that the new schemes introduced provide the State with value for money, as they must.  I assure the Deputies that the process of monitoring and evaluation of all research, enterprise and taxation is ongoing and regularly reviewed.  In the case of the KDB scheme, I remind Deputies that the reports on tax expenditure published with the budget in 2015 provided an <i>ex ante<\/i>evaluation of the KDB.  That evaluation outlined the basis for the best estimate of tax foregone of &euro;50 million.  This &euro;50 million is in respect of all aspects of the KDB, not just certification.<\/p><p>To answer one of the questions on monitoring and evaluating and the opportunity for Deputies such as those opposite to carry out an analysis of the scheme, the annual Estimates allow that.  That, as far as I know, is correct, is it not?  Any Deputy in the House may, during the Estimates process, bring an evaluation or assessment of the scheme before the D&aacute;il based on the information that has been given.  The information comes from the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Minister, who is obliged to provide it.  It would be folly for any Minister to provide wrong information because he would be failing to provide the proper information accredited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As such, there is an opportunity in the D&aacute;il to, as each Deputy sees fit, evaluate how the scheme has worked in all its aspects including tax credits, small to medium businesses and large business.  It is open for any Deputy to do that in the D&aacute;il, particularly in the context of matters relating to the portfolio of the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#N00200","speaker":"1351"},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>A great deal of this is onerous and would be difficult to establish effectively.  Much of what is being asked for is already done by the Department of Finance in the form of budgets and technical papers.  I am of the view that a lot of it is covered and we must be careful not to create unnecessary red tape.  When one looks at amendment No. 8 and the obligation it would impose on companies to list any past or previous grants, subsidies, tax incentives or research supports, one sees how that would become tremendously onerous.  It is not entirely clear if it would be a positive that a company succeeded in obtaining these things in the past or whether it would be a negative in the context of its application.  If we put it all in the full context of where the economy stands, companies with research and development departments increased employment between 2000 and 2014 by 101% in the service sector.  In effect, they doubled the level of employment whereas the employment rate among manufacturing firms that were not actively engaged in research and development was down by 72%.  There is a clear divergence which is the full context for the Bill and the thrust of its provisions.  While I appreciate the points being put forward, an onerous burden and a great deal of red tape are being proposed.

If a new product works well and one has done one's due diligence, one starts manufacturing it and one goes from there.  I agree with the Minister of State on this.  Much of the language used in the amendments is vague.  There is a proposal to include the cost to date to the Exchequer of revenues foregone.  The opposite side of the argument is that many of these companies might not have invested if they had not received a tax break to mitigate the risk of investing to get these off the ground.  That language is vague and there is an argument that they might not have come in had they not had the tax break.  I understand Deputy Boyd Barrett is asking how much money is foregone if they are not charged 12.5%, but they might not come in at all if they do not have the KDB  break.  That is the issue with that.  Another issue is the language on an impact on the delivery of an effective tax rate.  Is that Deputy Boyd Barrett's interpretation of an effective tax rate?  There is also an issue with the language relating to appropriate annual information.  What constitutes such information?  That has not been defined.  The Minister of State has explained that the Comptroller and Auditor General can provide the information we have anyway, but the language around a great deal of this is vague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#N00700","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>Obviously, we disagree on these things.  I will not labour the point, but will make my final intervention on the group of amendments.  In direct response to the last point, I note that the Bill is supposed to deal specifically with small and medium enterprises.  It is not supposed to give rise to a debate about foreign direct investment.  As such, that particular argument does not hold.<\/p><p>Ironically, it might be relevant if some of my other questions are not addressed adequately.  Could this measure be abused by companies that are not supposed to benefit?  Under its own terms, the Bill is not supposed to be about foreign direct investment but about extending tax breaks to encourage domestic SMEs.<\/p><p> On the issue of information already available from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the amendments are trying to achieve an intersection of various Departments or State aids for companies that link together.  The Bill is from the Minister of State's Department, but its subject matter also involves Revenue and possibly other Departments that are supporting companies.  We will not fully understand how much of a benefit may be conferred on particular companies, how much public money will be expended and whether we will receive any benefit in return unless we have the whole rather than a fragmented picture.  The amendments in this series try to ensure we would have the full picture.<\/p><p> In terms of revenue forgone, come on.  Surely I only have to say the words \"Apple\" and \"section 110\".  Regardless of what the Minister of State thinks about this or which side he takes - we take different sides on these matters - all sides agree that section 110 was abused.  The information was not available or scrutinised.  It was not transparent enough to allow people to know that the vulture funds which had many property assets were paying no tax at all.  We only found out after the fact.  We still do not know how much tax was forgone because of section 110, but the estimates run into billions of euro.  This is serious stuff.  To my mind, it is a minimum requirement that we know how much tax will be forgone under a measure such as this in order that we can monitor the position.  I am unsure as to whether the Minister cited an estimate on Second Stage.  Does the Minster of State have a projected estimate of how much tax will be forgone in the first year or over time?  If he does, we will need to test it against the actuality as time passes.  If we find that the figure balloons beyond the estimated amount, it might be evidence of major abuse.  It is critical that we have this level of oversight, reporting and monitoring of such tax breaks.  I have argued strongly that the Committee on Budget Scrutiny should examine every subhead under the corporate tax heading through which tax liability is reduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2017030900002#N00800","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1489068000,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>According to the Department of Finance, the overall amount for the scheme is &euro;50 million.<\/p> <p>  I will address a number of small points.

It is not the responsibility of my Department but that of the Department of Finance to evaluate reliefs on a regular basis.  This is to ensure they meet the policy objectives and support job creation and innovation.  The knowledge development box, KDB, legislation provided for in the Finance Act 2015 included a review clause in order that an evaluation would be conducted.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will undertake a county by county assessment which will be given to the Minister's office.  The Minister will assess the scheme.  It will then be placed before the D&aacute;il, through which forum it will be open to the public and every Deputy to assess and debate how the scheme has operated financially and otherwise county by county.
