The letter of invitation proposed a wide range for our discussion today and I will not attempt to be comprehensive in my brief opening statement.  Perhaps the best way of ordering my introductory comments is by reference to the Central Bank's three-year strategic plan, published in November, which gives a picture of what we are focusing on.  Consistent with our governing legislation, the Central Bank Commission has set the following key elements: restore financial stability and support economic recovery in Ireland through the successful exit from the EU-IMF programme and restoring a fully functioning banking system; reform the regulatory and supervisory framework to ensure risks to stability and consumer protection are identified and effectively mitigated; protect consumers by challenging firms, improving firms' compliance and promoting a better culture to help consumers have more confidence in financial services; and influence international policy making in monetary policy, financial stability and regulatory standard setting.  Underpinning these activities over the three years ahead will be a focus on improved efficiencies and cost effectiveness, alongside the continuing development of our staff.<\/p><p>  Delivering on this extensive mandate has, to say the least, been quite a challenge over recent years, involving many judgment calls, a significant increase in the volume of activity and employment in the Central Bank, and a re-engineering of how we do business.  While the condition of the economy and the banking system still leaves much to be desired, I believe things are moving in the right direction.<\/p><p>  As far as the economy overall is concerned it is fair to say that, since the level of economic activity collapsed in 2008-09, the elevated level of personal savings, the need to repair the public finances and for balance sheet repair more generally has meant that domestic demand has continued to shrink year on year.  Overall employment and incomes would have fallen even further were it not for the offsetting performance of exporting firms despite a much weaker international environment even than was expected two years ago.  A reversal of some of the loss of competitiveness that was incurred in earlier years has contributed here, though more is needed if the return to growth in private sector employment is to be accelerated to the point where overall employment is growing again on a sustainable basis - which our forecasters believe could happen during the course of this year.<\/p><p>  Against this background, the Government's determination and achievement in making the agreed, necessary overall reduction since 2008 in the gap between taxation and spending - painful though it is for many - has been a vital element in restoring the confidence of official and private international lenders which is a prerequisite for sustained recovery in employment and economic prosperity.  The Government has recovered access to the bond markets and, while the cost of borrowing has reduced considerably in the past half year, I am sure that spreads would have fallen even lower were it not for the wider uncertainties in sovereign debt markets.<\/p><p>  The reconstruction of a healthy banking system has been hampered by the scale of bank losses, and the fact that such a large fraction of their borrowers, both households and firms, are under stress.  During the period from 2009 to 2011, the capacity of the public authorities was stretched to the limit in sourcing the liquidity and the capital needed for the basic functioning of the banking system.  While the rest of the public finances also needed urgent adjustment, it was this additional pressure that tipped the country into the need for official assistance in the EU-IMF programme.<\/p><p>  Apart from rebuilding their financial buffers, the banks have had to completely overhaul their loan recovery operations and to develop effective methods of loan underwriting in a new environment.<\/p> <p>It is no secret that the Central Bank has been concerned at the pace of both dimensions.  In going well beyond what has been customary for a regulator, the Central Bank has been closely reviewing the steps being taken by banks to engage with stressed mortgage and other borrowers under what we call the mortgage arrears resolution process.  Certainly the banks have ramped-up their activity here, but progress towards ensuring that unsustainable debts are appropriately restructured, while also ensuring - in a manner consistent with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears - that those currently in arrears whose circumstances should enable them to service their debts get back on schedule, is clearly far from adequate so far.  There are risks on both sides here.  Too lenient an approach to loan recovery would result in an intolerably heavy bill for the Exchequer and hence the taxpayer and the user of public services.  On the other hand, too much reluctance to face up to reality about unsustainable debts on the part of the banks will also delay the economic recovery.<\/p><p> The Personal Insolvency Act, PIA, 2012 provides a welcome new route whereby distressed mortgage borrowers - especially those with multiple indebtedness - can find solutions, but it would be better for all if the banks could still get ahead of the curve and resolve the bulk of the cases without them having to go through what is still, of course, an untested process.  The Central Bank will continue its intensive step-by-step engagement with the banks on this matter until we are satisfied that they have sufficient policies and procedures in place.<\/p><p> The introduction of the European banking union and single supervisory mechanism, SSM, has been agreed since I appeared last before the committee.  The design, development and implementation of the framework for the SSM will be a key task at euro level throughout 2013.<\/p><p> The move towards a systematic approach to supervision, resolution and deposit protection is part of what is needed to place the euro area institutional structure on a more robust basis, building market and public confidence across the Union.  We in Ireland recognise, perhaps better than others, the value of filling these institutional gaps, but it must be done well.  To be successful, it is important that the new mechanism has a best practice supervisory toolkit, effective and efficient decision-making procedures, a top notch risk-assessment framework and a robust jointly-shared supervisory culture.  New resolution rules, and particularly important in Ireland's case the potential use of ESM direct recapitalisation, need to come into full operation and be ready for use by the SSM to ensure the success of the project.  To all of this, the Central Bank will continue to contribute, not least during the six months of the Presidency.<\/p><p> As far as supervision is concerned, greater distance between supervisors and the banks they regulate can help improve the capacity for challenge and ensure a broader, more detached perspective on issues.  At the same time, local knowledge is equally important.  Balancing these two dimensions will be a key part of the new regime.<\/p><p> While many details remain to be determined, it is clear that much of the supervisory work will still be delegated in practice to national supervisors so that the work we have been doing in Ireland to strengthen the national supervisory system will remain equally relevant for the period ahead.  In addition, it should not be forgotten that the current proposals only refer to banks, and by far the largest part of the national supervisory and regulatory regime relates to other types of financial firms.<\/p><p> My last attendance at this committee was in March 2012 and was focused on the issue of that month's instalment payment on IBRC's promissory notes.  As the committee will recall, an interim solution was applied to that instalment, which was effectively settled with a long-term Government bond rather than cash.  While this was not altogether an ideal solution from anyone's point of view, seeking a non-cash solution for that instalment was a sound tactic for the Government, embarking as it was on the larger question of rearranging the duration and terms of the overall Central Bank indebtedness arising out of the failure of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS and the payment of their creditors.<\/p><p> Since then, there has been an intensive process of discussion and negotiation on this matter, which is one of the two main thrusts of the Government's policy to have a euro area review of the overall indebtedness arising out of the banking crisis.  There is considerable goodwill from all interlocutors in this process.  Nevertheless, it has not been easy to find a generally acceptable solution.  Taking into account both the statutory position and wider policy stance of the ECB, an initiative of this type will be novel and, as such, challenging.  Using our knowledge of central banking law and practice, we have been working carefully to build understanding and confidence around a set of proposed transactions designed to deliver for Ireland, while not taking other decision makers too far out of their comfort zone.  The ECB is an organisation that seeks to proceed as far as possible by consensus, and it is not surprising that this work has been taking quite a while.  In fact, what we have designed from our side is, I believe, largely in the interests of the euro system as a whole.  On work in progress, I have nothing to add today to what has already been said by the Minister for Finance about the prospects and timing of the conclusion to these discussions.  I am happy to take any questions the committee might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358345400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Honohan.

Now that the insolvency legislation has been passed, one observational difficulty there might be is that with the deferment process that was there prior to the insolvency legislation, the ongoing deferment of problems was making difficulties in some situations even worse where compound debt was merely being added up on top of compound debt.  The intention of the insolvency legislation is that it would be seen, for those who are in what might be described as an unrescuable situation or for whom if they were left in their situation it would merely become worse, as an opportunity of getting out of that level of burden.  How will the Central Bank set out to monitor how the banks will progressively and positively engage with that legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600004#D00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358345400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Our view on the legislation, as I mentioned, is favourable.

In fact, as the committee will be aware, the legislation provides, speaking loosely, that there has to have been a six-month engagement period between the bank and the borrower and that is to allow both of them to sort the matter out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1358345400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>On Saturday morning last I had two constituents in my office who now are aware that the insolvency legislation has passed.

They have not been able to service the mortgages on those premises because they have lost their jobs and because of other circumstances and they are now in a situation where continuing to reside in these properties is making a bad situation worse.  The monitoring, evaluation and reporting plan, MERP, for them was only a deferment or a stay of execution.  What they want to do is get out of that property in such a way that they do not have legacy debt remaining in it, and that is what people would hope to see as a result of the insolvency legislation.  My question to the Governor, which is indirectly with regard to how the banks engage with this, is what will the Central Bank be doing to monitor this and create some level of accountability with the banking sector in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600004#D00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358345400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I would reiterate it is neither our intention nor the design of the current regime to only kick the can down the road and make temporary arrangements.

The actual value will be confirmed by the homeowner shortly thereafter and in the normal course this will be accepted by the State.  The valuation of all homes in the country will have major significance for all banks with mortgages and other charges on properties.  It is clear that in many cases the new process may result in many houses being valued at substantially less than the figure at which the banks valued them and the associated loans.  This will have significant implications for the balance sheets of banks.  What discussions has Professor Honohan had with the Government, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the banks to prepare for this?  This will be the first time we have a crystallisation of the values of the residential property market in Ireland.  When property loans were transferred to NAMA the value of these loans was crystallised which resulted in a write-down of 58% of the property loan portfolio.

It seems incongruous that we should go through a major process to value all houses through the Revenue Commissioners while the Central Bank, which is responsible for the stability and the risks of the banks, may not have access directly to that information.  Mr. Honohan that he provided for average prices to be written down by 59%.  That 59% has not trickled down to home owners.  It is still sitting in the bank's balance sheet.  When will we see that 59% write-down?  When will the provision that the taxpayer put into the banks trickle down to home owners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600006#F00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358346600,"counter":38,"content":"<p>It is important to bear in mind that the Government did not provide a sum of money to be parcelled up to borrowers in negative equity.

I welcome Professor Honohan to this meeting.  I always enjoy his engagement with this committee and listening to his opinions outside of the committee.  I have a number of questions but may not have time to get through them all.  Regarding the recapitalisation of the banks - which the Government has decided will only apply to the pillar banks - cold water has been poured on it by various commentators in recent days.  An editorial in the <i>Financial Times<\/i> yesterday stated that there had been a row-back in Europe's position regarding the possibility of the ESM recapitalising banks directly.  It suggests that the European Union will ask member states to guarantee the losses of the ESM or to put up 50% of the recapitalisation funding for the banks.  In today's edition <i>The Wall Street Journal <\/i>provides details of the meeting that took place last week between eurozone leaders and suggests that there is nearly unanimous agreement that national parliaments would recapitalise up to 4.5% of core, tier 1 ratios.  In other words, the first half of the recapitalisation requirement would be provided by national parliaments.  The second half is where the issue gets sticky and that is to be discussed next Monday.  The suggestion is that there would be a joint investment by the ESM, along with national parliaments, up to 30%.  If any of that were to happen it would basically tear into shreds the agreement that was struck last summer regarding separating sovereign and banking debt and breaking that vicious circle.  Obviously Professor Honohan is head of the Central Bank here but as a board member of the ECB, has he seen the Commission's latest report, which is very short, stating this?  Is he aware of the discussions that have taken place and is cold water being poured on this?  Are attempts being made to water down what was agreed in June?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600008#H01000","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358347800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>In general terms I am aware of the discussions but I am not part of them because they do not involve the ECB.  This is an intergovernmental matter.  Certainly, the announcement after the euro area summit last June was a statement from which we took a lot of comfort.  Ever since then we have been trying to find out how it will pan out.  There have been fluctuations in the statements and drafts on different elements.  To some extent, one of the benefits of the creation of the single supervisory mechanism is that it provides confidence to people in creditor countries who fear that they might have to pick up the pieces in the event of a future banking failure.  The assurance that banks in other countries are being well supervised is a step towards providing the confidence that the ESM's involvement in capitalisation of banks could be more generous.  On the question of the 4.5% and whether that winds back to what was put into the banks in 2011, who knows?  What negotiators are talking about now is primarily the future regime.  The discussion in June and the eurozone summit really referred to the previous position of the Irish banks.  I do not know and am not going to suggest that we are clear on the previous activity.  That is a discussion that will be had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600008#H01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1358347800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I appreciate that and acknowledge the fact that Professor Honohan is not at the heart of these discussions.  However, it seems clear that they are trying to row back.  If member states in the future have to guarantee the losses of the ESM for the ESM to invest in banks, it makes it more difficult for our Government to recoup the money that was transferred from the Irish taxpayer to the banks here.<\/p><p>  The promissory note is a key issue and I listened to what Professor Honohan said earlier about extending the duration, changing the terms and so on and that this is all the ECB can really do in this regard.  What people really want is their money back.  They do not want the &euro;28.1 billion that is promised to be injected into the IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank, for the next 15 years to be paid.  They do not want it to be paid by a long-term bond, by a cash payment or the way it was paid last year, through the five-hand trick whereby the Government issues a bond to the IBRC, the IBRC gets &euro;3.1 billion from NAMA, which is owned by the State, IBRC sells the bond to Bank of Ireland, of which we own approximately one third, and then Bank of Ireland gives the money back to NAMA.  That is a five card trick but at the end of the day, the Central Bank got its money, its liability to the ECB was paid off and Ireland's debt has not decreased as a result of the trick.  Is there any situation that Professor Honohan could see where this debt of &euro;28.1 billion would not be payable by Irish taxpayers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600008#H01200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358347800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Not within the central banking system, no.

What we have designed is largely in the interests of the eurozone system as a whole.  The design is there and I appreciate that Professor Honohan is not going to tell us about it here.  However, I ask him to give us some indicators on a few key questions which are of interest to ordinary people because most people do not care about accountancy tricks.  Will this design reduce our debt to GDP ratio?  Will it reduce the amount of capital we have to pay to the IBRC?  Will it reduce the amount of interest to be paid or will an extension of the term actually result in an increased amount of interest?

While it will not change the debt on day one, it would allow a slower and better path to the debt going forward.  Any transaction that involves a lengthening of maturities could end up adding lots more years of interest but if the interest rates are sufficiently low, then that is also advantageous.  One should not worry on that score.  I acknowledge that last year&rsquo;s arrangement was not of great advantage, although it was slightly advantageous to Ireland, but that was because it was part of a wider solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600008#H01600","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358348400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I will move on to mortgages as we are running out of time.  We have had engagements with public interest directors and we have heard from bank CEOs, some of whom have been on the media speaking about the Personal Insolvency Bill, most notably Mr. Richie Boucher who stated categorically that there would be no write-down of debt.  Public interest directors have made the same argument.  I expect that there will be only limited engagement with the Personal Insolvency Bill.<\/p><p>  To return to what Deputy O'Donnell asked previously, what will the Central Bank do on the issue?  I looked at the statement the Governor made before the committee in September 2011.  I agree with what he said then that resolving the problem with arrears would require a case-by-case action by the banks and that the banks must ramp up their effort.  He also said that the Central Bank must ensure that progress is made.<\/p><p>  Since the time when the Governor delivered that statement to the committee 62,000 people were in arrears for more than 90 days.  In September 2012 there were 86,000 people in arrears &ndash; an increase of 24,000.  The number of mortgages that have been restructured has increased from 67,000 to 81,000.  I agree with the Central Bank, Fiona Muldoon and what the Governor and Matthew Elderfield have said before the committee.  The banks have not done enough.  They have not been aggressive enough.<\/p><p>  However, the Central Bank has not done enough.  Is it powerless in terms of enforcing the banks to do that?  It cannot just sit back and say what has been said, which is helpful.  An enforcement mechanism is required that would force the banks to deal with the issue, which they have not done to date.  We have had evidence provided to committees such as from Bank of Ireland, for example, showing that there have been 13 applications for the buy-to-let scheme.   The banks are simply not doing what is needed.  I do not know what powers the Central Bank has.  Professor Honohan said that the Central Bank has set deliverables and they have been delivered.  What were the deliverables that were achieved in the past year?  It is clear that the mortgage crisis got out of control.  One in four people with private domestic dwellings is now in mortgage distress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600009#J00200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358348400,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I am glad that Deputy Doherty pointed out that we set deliverables and they have been delivered because that could give a misleading impression.  The sorts of deliverable that we set were for the banks to provide us with a report that would explain what they are doing.  We would comment on those and the banks in turn would have to make a further report stating what they would do, what number of people they would hire and what protocols would be put in place.  Inspectors have gone into banks and listened to the conversations that were taking place to ascertain whether the process was adequate and used international expertise to engage with people to find a solution.  I am probably not describing the process adequately.  We are quite concerned about this development.  I was also concerned to read and hear the evidence that bank directors were trying to avoid the use of some trigger words around debt.  If not, if it was the case that they were simply saying they would get all the money back, they are not going to get all the money back and that is why capital was invested.  At the same time it is very important that this is not a give-away by the Government because as members are aware, the Government does not have any spare money to give away.<\/p><p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell rightly said that we should not pay lip-service or engage in grandstanding.  That is not what we are doing but our tools are ones of engagement with the banks.  The Chair wants us to come out with targets.  We are working on targets but I do not want there to be too much reliance on targets for the banks to meet because they will meet the targets, but if the target is a simple one, they will meet it in a way that does not deliver the goods.  Apart from what we have said about the directors, I do not think it is the case that the banks are reluctant to do this.  They are hesitating because they are not sure which way to jump as they do not yet have a good way of sorting the debtors that need a fundamental and permanent restructuring from those that can be brought back on track in a reasonable period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1358348400,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank the Governor for attending the meeting.

The first prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, was in 2010.  The next was in 2011.  On both occasions I suggested it was not enough.  Why was that?  The problem, or swamp, we are now stuck in, and from which the banks are not extricating themselves, is that they are not getting on with the job they could have got on with, which is to recalibrate loans to the repayable amounts to allow for normalised remainder spending of household budgets.<\/p> <p>The banks are not extricating themselves from this.  They are not getting on with the job they could have got on with, which is to recalibrate loans to repayable amounts to allow for normalised remainder spending of household budgets, to which Deputy Higgins referred.<\/p><p> Banks need capital to do that.  The first donkey-simple way to get capital was from the State but it is not now because the people who invested in the banks and backed them were bond investors, who were totally exonerated.  They got all their returns, including their principal.  We are offering ourselves up as paschal lambs to the euro system.  It is nuts.  As Deputy Higgins said, Ireland has only 1% of the EU population and accounts for 1.2% of its GDP but we have taken 40% of the banking losses to date in the euro system.  It is the biggest failure, yet we are the people holding the whole structure together.<\/p><p> I do not believe Professor Honohan.  As he said on page 2 of his submission, a series of judgments was made.  The judgments were not good.  I am not patting myself on the back but I said at the time it would cost &euro;100 billion because that is what the facts and figures indicated.  When six small banks lend &euro;400 billion in four years, &euro;100 billion will not be collected hail, rain or snow and, therefore, the provisioning should have been immediate and the creditors should have been brought in and sat down.  The creditors are the very people the Governor is talking about, including the euro system, his bank and the ECB in turn.  He said in reply to Deputy O'Donnell that the ECB is not in the business of giving grants.  Of course it is not but if the ECB is a bank, it also has to make provisions if it made bad loans.  Professor Honohan said we accepted frameworks but all of them have got us to where we are.  Now we have to engage in some fresh thinking.  It is again a judgment call but I do not believe the consequences would be hell, brimstone and firewater.  The banks would have to start solving the problem from first principles.  Deutsche Bank only a month ago had to admit to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US a potential overstatement accounting fraud of &euro;12 billion on its balance sheet.  This is stinky stuff.<\/p><p> We have to get on.  Deputy Fleming is correct that the banks need to engage in write-downs to collectible amounts.  At the end of his contribution, Professor Honohan said: &quot;In fact, what we have designed from our side is, I believe, largely in the interests of the euro system as a whole.&quot;  This raises two questions.  First, what has he designed?  Unless it is a replacement note with zero interest in perpetuity, which is effectively a write-down or write-off, it will be useless.  Second, the euro system is an accepted framework that has not served us well or morally fairly, as Deputy Higgins pointed out.  Let us get real.  I have said <i>ad nauseam<\/i>to the Governor and to the Minister for Finance that they should speak up and make the case that Deputy Higgins outlined.  He was the first man to present the case to President Barroso in the European Parliament two and a half years ago and the President lost his cool.  The Deputy, who never uses strong or bad language, gave him the facts.  He presented what he outlined earlier and Mr. Barroso went ballistic because it was the truth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600011#L03000","speaker":"1027","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358350200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>This is an increasingly biblical encounter.  We have had the creation and hellfire and brimstone.  I would like to pursue the same theme as Deputy Mathews.  The phrase that jumped out at me from the Governor's presentation was the desire not to take other decision makers too far out of their comfort zone.  That is a revealing comment from his point of view.  I have two essential queries to put to him, the first of which relates to the promissory note.  He stated at a previous committee hearing that as a central banker, he cannot envisage circumstances in which the promissory note is not paid within the central banking system.  He went on to say that if that scenario were to unfold, the initiative would have to come from elsewhere.  This is important and I underline that fact because it should not be taken from this meeting that non-payment of the note is simply not an option.  He is saying, as a central banker, that within that system he cannot envisage non-payment but he is conceding that there is a political scenario and a broader scenario within the European system where non-payment is possible without the hellfire, brimstone and catastrophe one might envisage.  I would like him to set out for us how it is that we do not pay because it is not my strong view that it is not our debt and not another cent should be paid in respect of the promissory note.  Will he sketch out the other actors and the other initiatives that need to happen to ensure we do not have to pay the note?  That is the first challenge to him.<\/p><p>  The second also relates to the comfort zone of decision makers.  The Governor referred to delivering his deliverables.  His deliverables, with all due respect, sound lame if it is a case of protocols and listening to conversations between bankers and some unfortunate who cannot meet his or her mortgage repayments and is laden down with debt.  It strikes me that the Central Bank is not prepared to press banks beyond their comfort zone and into the zone of reality, as set out by other members, where it is not a case of a blanket write-down.  However, what is required is bankers facing reality and the reality faced by tens of thousands of families that will never be able to meet their mortgage debt and that cannot be allowed to be left stew in the juices of a pretence that somehow extend and pretend is okay.  That is not okay.  How will the Governor move the banks out of their comfort zone?  Will he set out the alternative scenario where we do not pay the promissory note?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600012#M00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358350200,"counter":193,"content":"<p>With regard to comfort zone, when one uses an unusual phrase, it gets picked on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600012#M00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1358350200,"counter":194,"content":"<p>It was in the Governor's script.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600012#M00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358350200,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I used it and then the Deputy picked up on it.

We have to get an agreement and if we ask for this, which is designed in such a way that it absolutely looks completely unacceptable, they will say \"No\" but maybe we can get the same by designing it in a little bit different way.  That is where the comfort zone comes in; it does not come in for the banks.  The Central Bank has no interest in leaving banks in any comfort zone.  We want results from the banks.  We cannot say, \"Just do it\", because they have not shown the capacity to just do it.  That is why we have to try to get them to have systems that will deliver and that is why it becomes apparently banal and mundane but if they do not have the systems, they will not be able to deliver on any numerical targets that we set in any realistic way.

At a recent event in Dublin I spoke to Ed Balls, MP, who said that even as an opposition politician he would not agree with a financial transaction tax in the UK without the co-operation of New York.

The paper to which the Deputy referred is an old paper about an international system.  Many people were saying that a considerable amount of money could be raised through this.  The problem is that the financial transactions vanish to other parts of the world or to other instruments that one has decided not to tax.  So it does not yield as much revenue as some people believe.  That is taken into account in the discussions in Europe and they do not expect huge revenue.<\/p><p>  Along with the ESRI, the Central Bank conducted some further research with particular focus on the Irish situation, including the IFSC.  Of course, it is not possible to really dig down and see what the effect would be.  This is in the past 12 months and it is published and available.  From memory we found the effects would be moderate overall.  If such a tax was landed on top of us, we felt it would not be the end of the world, but obviously there would be consequences for some financial service providers.  All taxes have consequences, but the Government has decided not to go with the group of countries that favour this tax.  A tax such as this sounds fantastic and some people regard it as an opportunity to get at the part of the economy that caused the crisis.  It is neither one thing nor the other.

MABS did so and the bank is aware of the medical situation.  From 27 December the bank has had her on autodial.  Permanent TSB has been asked by her and by MABS to stop this.

Much has been said previously about Ms Muldoon's comments and the Central Bank has, in the making, a poster girl for those in mortgage arrears.  Are her contributions equally possible to be interpreted as an implicit criticism of the Central Bank because she makes reference to words being misplaced for actions, etc?  Is she implicitly critical of the Central Bank in so far as it has failed to recognise that banks do not change their spots in the sense that they are resolutely pursuing persons who do not have the capacity to pay?  Has the Central Bank done any modelling on the upside for banks of dealing with this issue in the sense of the release into the economy of moneys that are currently not being spent?  I refer to those who need to change a car, redecorate a house and, perhaps, even to go out to eat, the spending in the economy that such activity would unleash and the upside in that respect for the banks.<\/p><p>  My second question is on the issue of banking supervision and the new regime being introduced.  In the context of this change, has the Governor given any consideration to changing the Statute of Limitations in so far as it enables customers and clients of banks who may have been mis-sold products - there is a case which has some currency at present in the Irish banking system - who, because it was unclear that the product that they had purchased was mis-sold to them, are now statute barred from getting involved in a case?  There is the ultimate irony where some, with the benefit of good legal advice, have benefited from pursuing that bank but others are locked outside by virtue of the Statute of Limitations.<\/p><p>  Reference has been made to the possibility of exiting the bailout agreement, but I wish to ask in respect of the desirability of it from the point of view of the affordable funding at low interest that the troika makes available to us relative to the cost of self-financing on the international markets given current interest rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600014#O00700","speaker":"986"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358351400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>On the last point, the borrowings that have been made most recently were cheaper than the average cost of borrowing through the programme.  That is the way the programme is supposed to work.  The programme is supposed to generate a positive momentum where everything is coming back and the markets regain confidence.  In many cases in other countries, the countries can cancel the programme stating, \"We do not need you anymore and we are back in the market fully.\"  The fact that this has been very slow has been due to two matters: first, the ongoing euro area crisis which has hampered the whole matter; and, second, in my view, the lack of a risk-sharing mechanism to do with banking.  The latter was never in the programme and we are still talking about it in terms of the ESM coming forward and making it possible.  That is not part of our current programme.  On what if it had been included, as we discussed at the time, nobody had a mechanism or an agreement to do that.  That is why this programme has been really quite slow.  We are pleased now the troika looks more likely to get out than it did six months ago.  All going well, and on our current trajectory, it would be cheaper to go out of it.

He stated he is helping to promote a better culture to help consumers have more confidence in financial services.  As a member of the committee I must say we do not have much confidence in financial services.  It is a landscape of bankrupt banks across the board.<\/p><p>  Professor Honohan listed the new design features which are being put in place retrospectively, which include a best practice regulatory supervisory toolkit, effective and efficient decision-making procedures and top-notch risk assessment.  However, it is a fact that his predecessors did not do this, which is why we walked into a currency which is so badly designed and which has raised unemployment from 4% to 14.8% and debt to 125% of GDP.<\/p><p>  Professor Honohan's predecessors at the Central Bank stand indicted for sleepwalking into the single currency, unlike the Treasury in the UK which applied tests as to whether it was sensibly based.  We found out at 42% of the total debt that it was a badly designed system.  I know the Central Bank is improving its level of economic expertise but this has an element of the stable door being shut after the horse has bolted.  People outside the Central Bank and the Department of Finance stated those consequences could have been predicted from all of the design faults of the single currency which we have now found and which we are trying to address.  The Department of Finance and the Central Bank need the level of economic expertise we are retrospectively bringing there but it is a major flaw in how we got into this situation.<\/p><p>  With regard to confidence in financial services, the PTSB announced a very large increase in lending.  Did it ask the Central Bank about this?  This is how it started before.  Anglo Irish Bank was not supervised adequately by Professor Honohan's predecessors.  If the PTSB goes on a large spending spree do we know whether other banks will cut back so it will be accommodated within a sensible level of lending in the Irish economy?<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, Professor Honohan referred to the compliant legal structure.  A financial service which is increasingly getting outside people's ability to afford is health insurance.  On 29 September 2011 the European Court of Justice stated the VHI continues to carry out its business without having received authorisation from the Financial Regulator, namely, the Central Bank.  We have had the Minister for Health owning a health insurance company and regulating the sector, while the European Court of Justice has stated it is the task of the Central Bank and I support this view.  A report published by the Commission last week stated the health sector in Ireland is a major source of inefficiencies in the public finances and in the lack of competitiveness.<\/p> <p>Should we not be compliant with the European court's instructions and will the witness advise the Minister for Health on the matter?  Professor Honohan is the financial regulator.<\/p><p> There is a report due on stockbrokers and there was malpractice in the area.  People also lack confidence in pension fund financial services, and pension funds seem to operate by adding extra years and accumulating vast debts, which worries people.  It seems strange that the area is regulated by the Department of Social Welfare and not the Central Bank.  It is a financial service which has directors trading while insolvent, as there are &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million in debts in some pension funds.  As we try to change the financial landscape, including health insurance, stocks, pension funds and accountancy, how can we get a respectable financial landscape?<\/p><p> Accountants have been known to move money between banks at 11.50 p.m. one day, with it recorded as being in the account all year, before moving it out again at 12.10 a.m. the following day.  That reflects badly on Ireland's standing.  I do not know who is supposed to regulate accountants but we are into our fifth year since such malpractice became evident and nobody has been charged or gone to jail because of them.  Tidying our financial landscape requires a dynamism which has not been there in the past, although I know the witness is trying to introduce it.  There has been much malpractice and Ireland does not present a very attractive financial landscape; one could say the financial landscape has contributed to mass unemployment and significant debt burden.  Much more tidying is required in that field.<\/p><p> I will support Professor Honohan in anything he can do to bring this about.  The financial sector caused this crisis in the Irish economy and it urgently requires tidying.  I thank the Chairman and Professor Honohan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600015#P02900","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358352600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I understand a decision has been taken to transfer the supervision of health insurance to the Central Bank and we have started the process of examining the firm.

Our two surviving banks should not be called going concerns but they are just about surviving.  Their capitalisation is still falling short of what is needed, which is an expression of their inability to deal with the existing reality.

Professor Honohan has indicated that he does not like predicting the future but are there signals of a concern as we enter into the process?  Those concerns may relate to the requirement for additional capital, however large or small that would be.<\/p><p>  The next question is related to the workings of the European banking system.  The OECD has released a report on capital ratios for banks across the European system, although I am not sure if the witness has seen it.  It has suggested that the core tier 1 capital ratio is not satisfactory as it requires the banks to weight their own products for risks.  It also has government bonds from euro member states as non-risk weighted.  Essentially, there is a reliance on the banks.  The OECD has suggested something similar to the United States, where there is 5% on all assets.  The report argues that European banks are under-capitalised to the tune of &euro;400 billion, with France and Germany being the leaders in this under-capitalisation.<\/p><p>  There is obviously weight behind this OECD report.  The target of the ECB is 9% core tier 1.  Is there any concern within the ECB about the targets?  Is there a concern that banks across Europe could be under-capitalised?<\/p> <p>Obviously, &euro;400 billion is a huge amount of money across the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013011600016#Q01900","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358353200,"counter":300,"content":"<p>As regards the stress test, I will not be drawn into an assessment of what that will be.  We are doing a serious exercise and have more information now and more analysis of what type of borrowers are in distress.  Some things have not gone as well since the last stress test, while other things have gone a bit better.  I will not be drawn into that, however.<\/p><p>  There has been a lot of discussion over the capitalisation of banks.  It is clear that the American banks have come out of this crisis faster than many people expected.  There is a lot of talk about $700 billion being poured into the banking system but most of it poured out again.  In most cases, the US government and its agencies cleared out of it.  <\/p><p>  In the European banks, there have been a number of stress tests using different models and approaches.  None of them was as in depth as ours because we obviously had the biggest problem to deal with.  <\/p><p>  As far as some of those specific points are concerned, including the measurement of risk-weighted capital, the Central Bank does not use very much of the banks' own models for risk weighting on the assets.  We have overrides in there and we do not think those models have really been tested over a long enough, stable period.  Therefore, we are not vulnerable to that particular critique.  We like to see what we have.

Women's Aid is part of the Turn Off the Red Light, TORL, campaign and is aware that some leading members of the campaign have presented to the committee.  Our focus will be on the links between prostitution and domestic violence and, in particular, on domestic violence as a factor of entry into prostitution and the similarities and common vulnerabilities between these two forms of violence against women.  Both are violations of human rights and a barrier to gender equality.  Like women experiencing domestic violence, women engaged in prostitution experience physical, sexual, psychological and financial abuse.  The issue of control is central in both situations.  The isolation, emotional and financial dependency, the threats and the use of violence are tactics that we also see in our work.<\/p><p>  The following words reported in the Paying the Price report by a woman named Frances are strikingly similar to what women experiencing domestic violence tell us every day:<blockquote>For my second pimp there was no way I could finish work without having at least &pound;200 every day... I didn't have a penny of it.  He chose my clothes... he chose my food, he told me when to eat, when to sleep, when to work, when to go home, when to speak.  I just could not do anything without his permission.<\/blockquote>Another similarity is the range of extremely harmful effects from this violence which include psychological harm, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and low self-confidence, as well as physical harm and severe injuries.  The two issues conflate when the intimate partner of the woman is the person coercing her into prostitution.<\/p><p>  In our work we sometimes hear of women experiencing domestic violence who are forced by their abusive partner to work as a prostitute or who are coerced by their partner to have sex with other persons in exchange for money or for drugs.  Conversely, Ruhama comes across the issue of grooming or direct coercion into prostitution by an intimate partner in the work they do with women involved in prostitution.  Intimate partner abuse by a partner or pimp is often a reality for women engaged in prostitution.  This is confirmed by US and UK research outlined in our submission.<\/p><p>  At times, women experiencing or escaping domestic violence who are forced into prostitution by the lack of any other income generation opportunity.  Poverty and lack of access to money and resources makes women vulnerable to entry into prostitution, particularly women with no access to household income for themselves and their children.  Following separation, non-payment of maintenance can be a major issue.  Some of the women we work with are not entitled to welfare benefits or social housing and may find themselves in extreme poverty.  Domestic violence is a major cause of homelessness, making women and children more vulnerable to prostitution.  A study of 60 homeless women in Ireland published in 2012 found that 72% of them had experienced violence and abuse in childhood and two thirds had experienced intimate partner violence, with 15% having engaged in sex work as a means of generating income.<\/p><p>  Child abuse and domestic violence often co-occur.  The Paying the Price report states that 85% of women in prostitution report physical abuse in the family, with 45% reporting familial sexual abuse.  It also concludes that, &quot;Given their vulnerability, children who have been affected by domestic violence are likely to be over-represented among children abused through prostitution&quot;.  Other TORL members have previously referred to the young age at which women get involved in prostitution, many of them when they are still under age.  In this respect, we are concerned about the trend of so-called &quot;loverboys&quot; where by young girls are groomed and coerced into prostitution by older boyfriends.  The UK report I mentioned also states:<blockquote>There is evidence to show that there are shifting patterns in the way in which prostitution is operating. The trend is away from pimps controlling a number of women and towards 'pimp\/partner' relationships. <\/blockquote>Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research on this issue in Ireland.  A recent article on women in Northern Ireland outlines the similarities and links between domestic violence and prostitution, especially with reference to the cycle of entrapment into prostitution and the cycle of domestic abuse.<\/p> <p>In our experience the law can be a powerful instrument to change attitudes and set the limits of what is and is not acceptable in society.  However, legislative change, while vital, is not enough on its own.  Support services and access to housing and welfare supports are equally important to offer viable exit strategies. <\/p><p> Women&rsquo;s Aid believes prostitution is intrinsically exploitative, harmful and violent and best tackled by targeting demand.  Targeting the sex buyer sends a clear message that buying sex is not socially acceptable and for this reason, we support the call for introducing legislation based on the Swedish model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600003#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Martin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358345400,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I ask members to confine their contributions to asking focused questions.

The decision on penalties should be based on an examination of what would be effective and what move us in the right direction.

The submission refers to a 2010 evaluation of the Swedish model which indicates that issues such as the indoor sex trade and technology such as mobile telephones are being targeted by the Swedish police.  A delegation from the joint committee visited Sweden in November to find out a little more about the operation of the Swedish law on the ground.  I was impressed by what we heard from the Swedish police who pointed out that the new model, which decriminalises the seller of sex, has assisted them in investigating and prosecuting offences because the woman, the seller of sex, is not at risk of being prosecuted or criminalised.  I do not know if the witnesses wish to comment or have a view on that issue but it strikes me that there is a parallel with domestic violence.  In the case of the latter, the police work in conjunction with someone who is viewed as a victim and under the Swedish model for dealing with prostitution, the seller of sex is essentially viewed as a victim or witness, rather than as another person who can be prosecuted, as is the case under the Irish system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600004#G01000","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358345400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>In terms of domestic violence, in many cases the woman is placed under pressure from her partner to withdraw from any criminal processes.  This is a live and ongoing difficulty for many women and one which needs to be addressed.  Any measures that can be introduced to remove these types of pressures from women and allow them to support criminal investigations and so forth would be much more effective if they mirrored the position regarding domestic violence.  Unfortunately, this is very often not the case.  The waiting time to have a barring order issued at the Dublin District Law Office in Dolphin House is approximately 12 weeks, which is a long time for people who are under pressure and whose partner knows everything about them.  Even if a barring order is in place or one feels one is protected, one needs a great deal of support and protection around that time.

They might take them when they are on the mitch.  We referred to an article that goes through this in some detail.  It is clear from talking to our support workers that similar things are happening to some extent here.  What was interesting about Holland is that it is a country that has taken a different approach from the Swedish approach.  It has not addressed the demand and it still leaves a huge number of women very vulnerable.  That was the concern.<\/p><p>  On the issue of control, we see a huge amount of isolation with domestic violence.  Certainly, the \"Prime Time\" programme showed women who never had a minute's peace, were at the end of a mobile telephone all the time and were not in a position to be able to make contact.  They were very much controlled.  I cannot imagine that this would shift significantly in a different jurisdiction.  However, it is important that somebody is able to control their own destiny and to be involved in work that is dignified and respected.

If there is less demand, it might not be necessary to have the same resources in terms of policing and one could concentrate those resources on certain points.  However, initially there might be a demand for increasing resources.  As regards resources for supporting the women, Ms O'Connor's research refers to 1,000 women in Ireland.  While the numbers are huge in the sense of the harm being done, they are not huge in terms of the resources we should be able to provide.

The shift in the Swedish model is that it criminalises the buyer.  It might mean there is a reduced market but it does not penalise a woman who is already involved in something that is potentially quite dangerous at times.  I have been involved with the issue of violence against women for a long time.  I was a volunteer in the Rape Crisis Centre a long time ago and have kept up to date with much of the research.  Women can be extremely vulnerable, certainly when one considers much of the serial killing in the past.  I was in Leeds during the time before the Yorkshire Ripper was captured.  He had moved from killing women who were seen as sex workers to students.  The view of women that is supported in society is very important.  It is important for women in terms of how they feel safe and what they can do.  When I spoke about coming here today to the women I work with, to gather information, they said they would see it as a positive endorsement to see something like this introduced in Ireland, whereby it is not acceptable that women's bodies are for sale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600005#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Martin"},{"type":"speech","time":1358346000,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Thank you for your input.

It is an alliance of sex workers, researchers and health and social care providers directly engaged with sex workers.  SWAI's mission is to promote the social inclusion, health, safety, civil rights and right to self determination of female, male and transgender sex workers in Ireland.  As a priority, we assert that any developments or changes in laws on prostitution should be informed by the voices of sex workers.  We trust they will be consulted in this process.<\/p><p>  I am a social scientist and an educator.  I have conducted research on prostitution for the national advisory committee on drugs and I engage with international organisations on sex work research.  I am speaking here on behalf of SWAI.<\/p><p>  We welcome the Government's decision to review legislation on prostitution in Ireland.  However, SWAI strongly opposes current proposals to introduce the Swedish model of criminalising people who buy sexual services.  I will comment briefly on international findings regarding such legislation and its potential impact on health and safety for sex workers and their customers.  In Sweden, the law has not succeeded in eliminating prostitution or trafficking.  In Norway, the legislation enacted in 2009 has had harmful, unintended consequences for sex workers.  The Ministry of Justice surveyed 123 sex workers in Oslo last year.  A total of 59% had experienced violence in the course of their work as opposed to 52% in 2008.  In addition, 25 sex workers were raped in the last year in Norway.  The law had heightened societal disapproval.  Harassment had increased.  The women felt more criminalised, stigmatised and isolated.<\/p> <p>Above all, they were afraid to report the violence and seek support.<\/p><p> As it stands, Norway is considering repealing its law in this area.  The UN has stated: \"[T]he [Swedish] law has not improved &ndash; indeed it has worsened &ndash; the lives of sex workers.\"  The Global Commission on HIV and the Law recommends decriminalisation of private and consensual adult sexual behaviours, including voluntary sex work, on the basis that criminalisation serves to \"drive people underground, away from essential health services, and heighten their risk of HIV\".  The World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization also oppose the criminalisation of clients.  The Irish Government is committed to reducing the spread of HIV, but the reality is that criminalising clients of prostitution will drive them and the providers underground and away from essential health services, including programmes to eradicate HIV.<\/p><p> SWAI's key concerns regarding proposed legislation relate to its potential impact on the health needs of sex workers and their clients, and the safety and freedom of sex workers.  There is concern about the incidence of trafficking into sex work in Ireland.  SWAI abhors coercion by trafficking or other means.  However, the research to which I referred indicates strongly that while criminalising clients may deter some operations, its main effect will be to drive the industry underground into the hands of criminals, thus making the detection of coercion and exploitation more rather than less difficult.  On behalf of SWAI, I thank the committee for the opportunity to present our concerns regarding this significant legal issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600005#H01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Teresa Whitaker","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358346600,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Whitaker.

Much of the information we are receiving suggests that people enter prostitution at a young age and for various reasons.

The numerous reports published in the past 20 years show that, sadly, such abuse is not an uncommon feature in Irish society.  We cannot, however, generalise about the background or situation of sex workers.  In looking at research, one must consider the social context including, in particular, location.  Without a doubt, some people enter sex work voluntarily.  There is a massive amount of research from Australia and New Zealand, for example, showing that there are women in their 20s and 30s who go into prostitution by choice and consider themselves sex workers.  The issue of people being groomed for prostitution at a very early age is a separate matter.  Those who are coerced, exploited or groomed by older people are in a different category from those who enter the business willingly.  There are laws to protect children in Ireland and that is not related to the situation of people who enter sex work voluntarily.<\/p><p>  Of the 35 people we interviewed for our research, three had been coerced into prostitution.  The others, who were using substances such as heroin or cocaine, chose sex work over other types of criminal activities including shoplifting, stealing and pushing or trafficking drugs.  Their choices were very limited but the option they chose was prostitution.  When I started my research, I had the same opinion as has been expressed here today.  As a sociologist who came through the traditional Irish universities and participated in feminist studies, I assumed that all women were coerced into prostitution.  I could not imagine how any woman in her right mind would do it and that it must be a terrible thing for all of them.  When I spoke to these women, however, I discovered that to them it was just work.  They were doing it to make money and had learned all types of survival strategies, such as how to negotiate with punters and so on.  However, the research from Sweden shows that sex workers there can no longer negotiate with clients because everything is done in a big rush.  Whereas before they might check out whether a potential client has a passenger in the back seat, for instance, there is no time for such precautions when the transaction must be done very quickly.  The research from Norway in the past year shows that for the women who remain in prostitution, their lives are in greater danger than they were before criminalisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600006#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Teresa Whitaker"},{"type":"speech","time":1358346600,"counter":361,"content":"<p>In the case of the people Dr. Whitaker represents in this country, how many have made the decision independently to choose prostitution as a way of life?

Making it illegal for men to buy sex will inevitably affect the women who are selling sex.  We are saying that the Government must take a compassionate approach to this very sensitive issue.<\/p> <p>The bottom line is to help people and to help society.  If we introduce the Swedish model, we will just push it all underground like we have done with so many other things in Irish society.  We really believe this is not the way forward.  Let us look at Australia and New Zealand.  Why is the committee looking at Sweden as a model?  Prohibition has never worked in any country.  Look at what happened when there was an attempt to prohibit alcohol in the United States.  It does not work.  The same is true of cigarette smoking.  Prohibition does not work; it just drives things underground.<\/p><p> In Sweden, pimping has got worse because now women need a protector in order to have someone between the client and the sex worker.  Pimping has increased in Sweden and sex tourism has also increased there.

A number of us heard Dr. Whitaker&rsquo;s presentation previously at the Department of Justice and Equality conference and we have been immersed in the topic for some time.  I disagree with Dr. Whitaker&rsquo;s analysis of the Swedish law.  Having read the recent analysis and having visited Sweden and spoken to many of the stakeholders, we have seen strong results in terms of halving the incidence of street prostitution since the law was introduced in 1999.  What we have heard and read is that the Swedish model is under serious consideration for expansion to other countries, notably France and this country also.  One must bear that in mind to balance out what Dr. Whitaker said.<\/p><p>  I also take issue with what Dr. Whitaker said about criminalisation.  Under the 1993 legislation, the purchase of sex is not itself an offence.  However, all the surrounding circumstances such as loitering for the purpose of prostitution and soliciting are criminalised.  The sale and purchase of sex are criminalised in certain conditions when it is done in an organised fashion and indoors.  Effectively, clients are currently criminalised.  That begs the question of what Dr. Whitaker is advocating.  Is the Swedish model not preferable to the current Irish model following her analysis of the negative effects of criminalisation, as it effectively criminalises both parties involved - the seller and the buyer of sex?  Dr. Whitaker says criminalisation has negative consequences.  If that is the case, is it not better to decriminalise the seller of sex, as in the Swedish model, than our current model?  If not, what model does Dr. Whitaker favour?<\/p><p>  Prostitution is underground in this country but it must still be accessible in order that people can purchase sex.  Numbers must be made available on the Internet and people must be able to know where they can buy sex.  It can never be underground to the extent of making it impossible to prosecute.  Again, what we heard in Sweden is that it is easier for police to prosecute where the seller of sex is not criminalised and is therefore not herself a target for the police.  It is easier then to get the evidence necessary to bring in the people organising the sale of sex &ndash; the pimps and traffickers.  Surely that is in everyone&rsquo;s interests no matter what our position on prostitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600007#K02000","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358347200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bacik for her question.

The most particular criticism is that the Swedish system drives prostitution further underground.  When we met with the Swedish justice committee, the Swedish police and social workers, we put that to every one of them, playing the role of devil's advocate.  All of them replied that prostitution by its very nature is underground but to sell \"the commodity\" it must be marketed, it must be put on a website.  Even though we talk about driving it underground, the seller of the commodity must market it to sustain a business.  There must be advertising of sex workers on a website to invite customers.  Their response, particularly from a policing perspective, was that this is never truly underground, even if efforts are made to be covert, because there must be open marketing.  What does the alliance make of that analysis?<\/p><p>  We have heard the point that not every sex worker has been trafficked or coerced, there are those who choose and who wish to continue working in that industry.  A social worker at the coal face who appeared before us and who has dealt with hundreds of women in this situation, told us that almost all the women she was working with on an exit strategy did not want to remain in prostitution.  Very few wanted to remain working in the sex industry.  Obviously a small number wanted to remain and that is the cohort Dr. Whitaker is advocating for.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, there are groups who work at the coal face with victims of prostitution: domestic violence groups, immigrant groups and trade unions.  This plethora of organisations has given evidence that in the vast majority of cases this is damaging to the women and men in this situation.  Our Swedish counterparts told us that we cannot legislate for the minority the alliance advocates for, we must legislate for the majority, we must look at the bigger picture to protect those who do not wish to continue.

The authorities in the regions and countries in question obviously did not believe only a minority was involved and they clearly believed it was safer to decriminalise it.  It is interesting to note that since decriminalisation pimps are largely absent from the sex industry in New Zealand.  Women have kicked out the male managers who previously managed brothels because they no longer needed them when prostitution was decriminalised. They run the brothels themselves and there is less evidence of pimping in New Zealand.

It is a tragedy that the trafficking of women has been mixed up with the issue of prostitution because they are two entirely separate issues.  Every discussion of prostitution becomes emotional and immediately strays into the areas of trafficking.  This is seriously hindering efforts to find a solution that addresses the needs of female, male and transgender people who want to work in the sex industry and those who need their services.  I am not a psychologist or lawyer but I hope my experience in life has made me a compassionate person.  While it is fine for people who are in legitimate sexual relationships, the compassion I feel is for those who need and may have to purchase the services of others.  That is my main point.<\/p><p>  When this issue came on the radar last year I noted statistics from the police in Sweden showing that the recently introduced Swedish model had resulted in prostitution moving from the main streets into back alleys and caused an increase in violence against women prostitutes.  I have seen the relevant figures.  <\/p><p>  I compliment Dr. Whitaker on her exemplary and rational presentation.  She should present her case on \"Prime Time\".  I note she arrived at her conclusions on the basis of research she had carried out.

Some of the women I speak to have indicated that the clients they prefer are those who have baby seats in the back of the car because they are the guys who go home to their wives afterwards.  I will not judge men - I will leave that to God - or comment on the reason they have sex drives.<\/p><p>  In some countries, men with disabilities can pay for the services of a sex worker.  In Australia, a woman who was born with a certain medical condition whose name I do not recall decided to enter politics and is now a Member of Parliament.

I also found it highly disturbing that the women were afraid to report violence to the police because attitudes are changing in Norway and people are become less tolerant of prostitution.

One must define what one means by \"exploitation\".  Who is being exploited?  Is it the person who gives the money or the person who gets the money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600010#N00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Teresa Whitaker"},{"type":"speech","time":1358349000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>It is making people do something they do not want to do or making a decision that they are able to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600010#N00600","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358349000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>Exactly.

It is quite difficult to come in at this stage when much of the discussion has already taken place, and I hope members will forgive me if I repeat anything that has already been covered.  I am grateful for the opportunity afforded to me and my colleague, Dr. Jane Pillinger, with whom I co-authored a research paper entitled Globalisation, Sex Trafficking and Prostitution, to present to the committee.  Several speakers referred to the lack of research in this area.  In fact, our research gives a very comprehensive review of both trafficking for sexual exploitation and the prostitution regime as it currently exists in Ireland.  The research has been validated by the Garda and the figures contained therein are very accurate.  It is our estimate that some 1,000 women are being purchased for sex at any given time in Ireland.<\/p><p>  I propose to confine myself today to some observations on the role of government in regard to this very contentious issue.  There are two main approaches taken by governments internationally.  Under the first approach, which is taken by a large number of countries, the state regards the demand for the purchase of a person for sexual gratification as legitimate, acceptable or, as Dr. Whitaker described it, inevitable.  Leading from this position is the notion that government should regulate and legislate to provide a legal and regulated market in which this particular consumer demand is met.  In other words, the state has a capacity and duty to protect the rights and welfare of girls and women who are made available to meet that demand.  This approach is probably best represented within the European Union by the Netherlands and Germany.  The stated aim of the Dutch law, for example, is to ensure that all trade in sex is \"desirable\" prostitution, provided only by adult, free, independent sex workers in legal locations.  The objective is to avoid \"undesirable\" prostitution by removing elements of coercion, force and associated criminality, such pimping, child prostitution, organised crime and trafficking.<\/p><p>  In my view, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that, ten years on, this approach has been a complete failure in the Netherlands.  The growth of the legal sector has reached unmanageable levels, with approximately 1,700 brothels and location-bound premises and an estimated 25,000 prostitutes serving a population of 16 million.  At the same time, the notion that the provision of a safe legal sector would remove the need for an illegal sector has been wholly disproved.  All of the research, backed up by the evidence of Dutch police, indicates that the illegal sector in Holland is as large, if not larger, than the regulated sector, and that associated organised crime is out of control.  Moreover, despite the fact that a key objective of the new regime was that it would function as an anti-trafficking measure, the number of trafficking victims is, in fact, increasing.  The 2007 evaluation, which is very comprehensive, found that pimping was widespread.<\/p><p>  It is very important to note that the pressure to regulate and legalise in the first place does come from a desire to safeguard the welfare and rights of sex workers.  Sadly, however, the evidence is increasingly more robust that prostitution is not a solution to women's poverty and economic need.  On the contrary, it exacerbates that need.  Women's welfare is very low down on the list of priorities for the main players in the market, namely, pimps, sex business owners and organised crime.  Ten years after the introduction of the new regime in Holland, the evaluators conclude that the emotional well-being of women is lower than it was prior to legalisation on all mental health indicators.  Despite a commitment in the law to ensure exit routes for women, only 6% of municipalities are compliant.<\/p><p>  A similar approach has been taken in Germany, the view being that prostitution should be treated as legitimate work.  Again, the idea was that those engaged in prostitution would be able to access legal entitlements, protection and health care.  That approach has now been deemed to have failed utterly.  In her latest book, Debra Satz argues that some markets are inherently noxious.  It is my view that governments should have no role in legitimising a noxious market.<\/p><p>  The second approach to the issue of prostitution is the Swedish one.  A decision was made in that country that the demand for the purchase of sex which requires making available a certain number of women and girls is not an acceptable, legitimate demand, not a legitimate market and, moreover, that such a market undermines gender equality.  That was the perspective from which the Swedes came at the issue.  They also rejected the notion that the state should seek to control this type of market.  Much of the discussion regarding the Swedish model has focused on whether it has been a success or a failure.  The International Labour Organization is very clear in its position that Sweden has had the greatest success in this area, with its sex trade sector now a diminished, tiny market in comparison with those in similar jurisdictions.  In Denmark, for example, the market is three to four times larger despite its population being only 5.3 million.  In Germany, according to the economists at the International Labour Organization, the sector is 60 times larger than in Sweden, even though Germany's population is only ten times greater.<\/p><p>  If we are seeking to effect a reduction in demand and a reduction in the numbers of people in prostitution, the evidence of what will actually work is irrefutable at this stage.<\/p> <p>The Nordic countries are moving towards a reduction and an elimination.  They are not perfect.  They have not eliminated prostitution at this point and I do not think the word \"model\" is as helpful as the word \"approach\".  They have been moving over the last ten years towards an irrefutable position which is that they have a diminished and tiny market in comparison with other countries.<\/p><p> Finally, Senator White brought up the issue of the relationship between trafficking for sexual exploitation and prostitution.  Two recent research papers published by the International Labour Organization have shown that there is a very clear correlation, which it has demonstrated and proven, between the scale of prostitution, that is, the number of people involved in prostitution, and the number of victims of trafficking and that the ratio is probably between 10% and 24%.  In other words, regardless of the prostitution regime - such as regulation in the Netherlands or tolerance in Ireland - if there are 1,000 women involved in prostitution, at least 10% to 24% of those women would be deemed as having been trafficked for sexual exploitation.<\/p><p> Trafficking is not the only source of violence and coercion, however.  A lot of the discussion today has focused on the fact that a lot of prostitution here is underground and indoors and it is critical that we look at more recent evidence regarding indoor prostitution.  A recent study of over 200 women in Chicago, for example, showed that the levels of sexual violence associated with indoor prostitution are higher than the levels of sexual violence on the streets.  There are certain levels of drug violence and physical violence on the streets but when discussing indoor prostitution, we should not assume that it is somehow a safer or more acceptable environment for women to work in.<\/p><p> As someone who has worked in the areas of sexual rights, reproductive rights and violence against women for most of my adult life, I believe and hope that all of us in this room are genuinely concerned about the rights of women in prostitution and women in general.  However, it is incredibly naive and flies in the face of the overwhelming evidence to believe that we can make prostitution safe.  It is an inherently harmful, abusive, exploitative and coercive industry.  It would be very remiss not to examine that overwhelming evidence and I am very glad that this committee is doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600011#O01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Monica O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358350200,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600012#P00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1358350200,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connor for her presentation.

I have read the criticisms from people like Petra &Ouml;stergren.  One of the most common attacks on the Swedish model is that the prostitution is now underground, but all prostitution is underground.  However, as Jonas Trolle of the special investigation unit has said, one presses a button and one is able to reach the prostitute.  It is a market and the supply is available.  It is not as underground as people think.  In Ireland we researched the industry and found it is in apartment blocks.  I was in apartment blocks in the Irish Financial Services Centre area.  Prostitution is all over Dublin and I have been in many apartment blocks where women are available for sex.  The reality is, if one wants to buy sex, it is very easy to find.  The Swedish police are involved in tracking and surveillance and are finding it very easy to track and find prostitution.<br \/><font color=\"#222222\">  Another issue concerns the debate about prostitution on the streets versus prostitution indoors.  Prostitution is primarily happening indoors.  It has been argued that it went underground in Sweden but over the last ten years, prostitution in almost every country has moved indoors, primarily.

In Sweden, for example, it is often forgotten that major educational campaigns were conducted alongside the criminalisation process.  The drink-driving campaign in Ireland is a useful example in this regard.  It is not an either-or situation.  We must go for education on what is acceptable.  The law in Sweden is declarative and normative and not just punitive.  What we should be attempting to do is to change the values.  We need to change how men see women in general and change the fact that they see it as acceptable to buy consent and to override consent in the context of  a consumerist model.  I would urge such an approach, which is educational but is also penalty-based.  Fines were mentioned, and in Sweden fines are issued.  They have a very rehabilitative system of justice.  They are not imprisoning people.  That is not what is happening.

Therefore, binary or polarisation of the issue is totally unnecessary.  Obviously if one decriminalises victims then one ensures that there is access to all HIV and healthcare.  The situation in Europe is very different to what was referred to by the UN.  For example, Sweden does not have an anti-harm reduction policy.  The polarisation of the matter ensures that there is an enhancement of harm reduction and harm elimination.  It is a parallel and complimentary system.  I accept that in places like India, which has a massive level of children and young people in prostitution, one does not want to criminalise them in such a way that they cannot access healthcare.  That is not what the Swedish or Nordic approaches are about.  There is confusion about the report, that it somehow suggests that what we are advocating in Ireland is not entirely supportive of harm reduction.  <\/p><p>  There is some confusion about gay and lesbian rights in this report.

One cannot introduce legislation without a cultural shift in society or educational programmes taking place.  I have a sense of how young girls and young men view themselves in terms of their sexuality and sexual power.  I know about the commercial pressures that are placed on children which shortens their childhood and demands them to be sexual objects before they are ready.  Does that play a part in dealing with prostitution here?  The delegation may have touched on the matter earlier and I apologise for going over old ground.  How big a role does drugs play in leading people into the sex trade?  I was a political counsellor in the inner city and I had to deal with an issue related to street prostitution.  At the time the Garda suggested that a drug habit led to the huge number of young women in prostitution.<\/p><p>  The Swedish approach seems to be the most sensible.  The delegation has outlined the comparative situations in the countries that surround Sweden and it has led people to believe that the Swedish model is a good approach.

I agree with him that this is not a simple matter but I will give two brief answers.<\/p><p>  There are between 40 to 60 young women on the streets in Dublin because of drug related issues.  Unfortunately, it has not been mentioned that 90% of prostitution is conducted indoors and the prostitutes are young migrant women.  Their level of drug abuse is quite different and includes prescription drugs, cocaine and other forms of drugs.  Drugs are still involved but prostitution is less visible.  Prostitution does not solve the issues of poverty, drug addiction and migrant women but exacerbates them.  The more young women who are in prostitution then the more drugs will be used.  Recently I interviewed women and I witnessed their gradual deterioration because they took more and more drugs to cope with what they had to do and they have quickly spiralled out of control.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for services, especially the provision of health services for the women who will speak about drugs and all of those issues at the next session.<\/p><p>  I passionately support the providing young men and women with education on sexuality.  By criminalising demand one would create a norm and provide an opportunity to discuss sexual consent and what consensual adult sex is.  It is not about the purchase, objectification and commodification of young girls.  My son travelled with a Swedish friend and he said that it was interesting that we have forgotten that in Sweden the criminalisation of prostitution was accompanied by a lot of education on how to perceive sexuality and young people participated in programmes about sexual consent.  It would be helpful if people could see that the issues are not mutually exclusive.  Imposing a penalty here would be a strong message by the Government that we do not accept that this set of girls are available for sale.  This approach would present a real opportunity for a wider discussion.<\/p> <p> I referred to the issue of drink driving.  If we as a society state that something is not acceptable, attitudes change.  Normative behaviour has much to do with what we have decided is acceptable.  I have worked in the areas that have been mentioned and I was a teacher.  The issues in question go hand in hand.

My doctoral research focused on the lived experiences of women involved in prostitution in Ireland and, in particular, on how their experiences were impacted by the context within which they negotiated their lives.  In the next few minutes, I will argue that any consideration of policy change should seek to enable rather than disempower those engaged in negotiating risk within the sex work environment.  I will briefly discuss some of the major findings of my research and their implications for policy.<\/p><p>  As has been mentioned, sex workers are not an homogenous group.  There is a variety of experiences of sex work and policy must account for this variability.  Sex work is a complex social phenomenon and experiences, including of risk, differ among sex workers, even within the same context.  Risk is not inherent - it is situational.  Risks transpire differently for different individuals.<\/p><p>  The women with whom I spoke as part of my study challenged the stereotypical notions of women and men in prostitution as passive or being vulnerable to risk.  They were active risk managers in their everyday lives.  However, their strategies or capacities for minimising risk were severely compromised within a criminalised regime, particularly so in the case of the most vulnerable people involved in prostitution.  As mentioned, criminalising activities associated with prostitution primarily targets those who are most visible and, as such, has the greatest negative impact on the most vulnerable.<\/p><p>  While I found evidence of positive relationships between sex workers and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, many of the women with whom I spoke felt that, because they operated outside of the law, they did not have recourse to legal safeguards and could not report violent crimes.  This serious issue is compounded by international evidence highlighting the impact of criminalised or partially criminalised environments on the capacities of sex workers to control where, under what circumstances and to whom they sell sex.  This exposes them to violence and exploitation.  The women with whom I spoke called for official recognition to ensure that their safety would be an institutional priority.<\/p><p>  Proponents of the Swedish model seek to criminalise demands as a means of eliminating prostitution.  While selling sex is legal in Sweden, there is a legislative limbo of sorts, as it is difficult for sex workers to do so and to do so safely.  This is a concern.  Furthermore, viewing sex work through a paradigm of violence against women and viewing all women involved in sex work as being at risk limits the capacity to distinguish between acts to which the women consent, however mistaken we believe their consent is, and acts to which sex workers have not consented and could leave them physically harmed or dead.  As such, it limits the opportunity to intervene to ensure the latter type of violence is reduced.<\/p><p>  An important issue has not been raised today, namely, that the Swedish legislation on banning the purchase of sex reduces sex work to a heterosexual exchange between a female seller and a male buyer.  This ban ignores the reality of male prostitution.  There is evidence in Ireland, particularly from the Gay Men's Health Project, of the lived realities and the issues impacting on the lives of male sex workers.  This issue needs to be considered.<\/p><p>  The ability to isolate and target victims of trafficking, coercion, exploitation and enslavement in the sex industry is severely compromised when all activities associated with that industry are regarded as exploitation.  Evidence from Sweden suggests that sex work is becoming less visible rather than less common.  Judging by presentations on a previous day, the issue of prostitution adapting to policy change needs consideration.  Some commentators have regarded the Swedish model as impacting on the sex industry in such a way that it becomes a chameleon.  Rather than retreating, it simply changes form to adapt to the new circumstances.  This makes law enforcement unworkable and perpetuates risks for the most vulnerable, as they become less visible.<\/p><p>  The criticism of the 2010 official evaluation of the Sex Purchase Act has been noted.  Senator Zappone referred to the lack of scientific rigour.  From a social science perspective, insisting that the purchase of sex needed to remain criminalised limited and weakened the integrity of the evaluative process.<\/p><p>  There has been mounting public criticism of the Swedish model within Sweden despite the official line of widespread public support for the ban.  The Swedish model, which has been described as a primarily male disciplinary model, does nothing to address gender inequalities and neglects other inequalities that can play important structural roles in prostitution, for example, class and race.  Furthermore, such a system compounds the inequalities faced by an already disenfranchised group of individuals involved in prostitution.<\/p><p>  Policies that solve problems need to be begin with pragmatic evidence-based data if they are to construct responses that do not start from ideological standpoints.<\/p> <p>While there are arguments, ideological and otherwise, for and against the merits of different prostitution systems, as have been noted, what should be of greatest concern in any debate is the effectiveness of policy in safeguarding the health and human rights of sex workers.  We do not know for sure what is valid and how much more needs to be found out, but much of the international evidence points to policies of decriminalisation rather than legalisation as being moves in the right direction.<\/p><p> While the exploitation and coercion of marginalised women, children and men into the sex industry needs to be the focus of criminal justice policy, structures of oppression and inequality that limit autonomy, particularly for women, cannot be addressed through prostitution law.  Instead, they call for wider social policy interventions.  Marginalising voices through exclusion and stigmatising through legislation compound some of the oppressive practices described at this meeting.  Shifting the focus away from criminal justice and towards public health, social justice and social care enables those who work with the most vulnerable groups in the sex industry to provide optimum support.  Safety for sex workers should be prioritised through harm reduction to protect those who are most vulnerable, to intervene for those who are at risk and to acknowledge those who do not conform to a victim identity.<\/p><p> While different perspectives have abounded and been aired at this meeting, perhaps we could find points of intersection concerning shared commitments to the safety, social justice and politics of inclusion for all, but particularly sex workers, in issues that will impact on their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600014#R00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathryn McGarry","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358352000,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McGarry for her interesting presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600015#S00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1358352000,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me to speak.  I will summarise our written submission and discuss free choice, violence against women and the legislation.  Our submission comes from a feminist perspective, in that we believe that prostitution is inherently exploitative of women.  From an ideological perspective as well as a practical one, the Swedish model is the best route to take in terms of legislation.<\/p><p>  We referred to trafficking.  Many women who are involved in prostitution do not fit the legal definition of having been trafficked, yet they did not enter the industry through free choice.  Since many women entered prostitution as children, they did not consent.  Coercion and deception are also issues, as are the \"lover boy\" type of relationships and pressure.  Poverty can lead to women who are in desperate situations and with limited choices entering prostitution.  Dr. Whitaker mentioned that women may choose prostitution over, for example, shoplifting or drug pushing, but the argument for free choice is not great if the only alternatives are other illegal activities.  It must be acknowledged that the majority of women in prostitution have not made free choices to enter the industry.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Ferris stated, the belief of all of the women present that we would never freely enter the sex industry is acknowledgement of how unlikely such a choice is for women.  We accept that some women freely choose to do so, but the majority do not.  We should legislate for the majority.<\/p><p>  Prostitution is inherently exploitative and there is a culture of coercion and violence owing to pimps, traffickers and brothel owners.  It is the idea that someone can buy another person's body to use as he or she pleases.  Given the culture of prostitution, the prostitute feels that he or she cannot say \"No\" to whatever is suggested and must go along with it once money changes hands even though an agreement has been negotiated beforehand.  This leads to a disassociation from the experience and a numbing of the physical senses.  For these reasons, there is a high instance of substance abuse.<\/p><p>  This situation is not in line with the dignity of people, particularly women.  Although it is not solely women who work in the sex industry, they form the majority.  The majority of buyers are men.  This creates a gender dynamic whereby the bodies of women are for sale in the sex industry, a situation that relates to the wider dynamic of the objectification of women in society and the media.<\/p><p>  We support the Swedish model.  Demand could be reduced by criminalising the sex industry.  Buyers have identified the risk of disclosure and gaining criminal records as a major deterrent for them.  We are told that, as the buyers are ordinary men, it would be bad to criminalise them, but there is no right to a sex life if it comes at the expense of someone else's right not to be abused and exploited because he or she is in desperate circumstances.  Demand can be reduced and the sex industry can be shrunk.<\/p><p>  Legislation would send a strong message to the effect that women's bodies cannot be bought and sold, but it would help were the legislation to be supported by an educational campaign similar to Sweden's.  Education on consent and sexuality needs to be in place in Irish schools so that societal norms can be changed when legislation is brought into effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600015#S00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emma Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1358352000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Regan.

I stated that arising from my study, viewing all women as \"at-risk\" in prostitution blurs the line, limiting the opportunity to make a distinction between acts to which a person has consented - however mistakenly we believe that is - and acts to which a person has not consented and which may leave him or her physically harmed or at risk from an individual.  It reduces the opportunity to intervene and target violence against women and men in prostitution.  If prostitution is regarded as inherently violent, we do not make any qualitative distinction between violence perpetrated against sex workers and the violence of society that forces somebody into the sex trade.<\/p><p>  It is a complex issue and there are a number of different ideological standpoints in this regard.  Such a stance can be unhelpful as it blurs the lines somewhat.  For example, it makes operational definitions difficult to establish from the outset, and coupled with this is the lack of substantial evidence on experiences in the sex industry in Ireland as a base line.  I make this point given the criticisms of the official Swedish evaluation, with the idea that sketchy evidence was presented that was very inconclusive with regard to what works, women's safety and so on.  With evaluation, we need pre-intervention or pre-policy data collection as well as post-policy data collection for comparison.  That was not available in Sweden and we do not have anything substantial in Ireland, regardless of some of the really good attempts at this work from Ms Monica O'Connor, Dr. Jane Pillinger and others involved in data collection on the sex industry in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Much of the conversation about the sex industry is Dublin-based and we must think about what is going on elsewhere.

This is not just global; it is happening within small communities.  The issue is very much one of the grooming of young vulnerable women by family members, pimps, networks of local criminals and so on.  The vulnerability and disadvantage experienced by so many of the women who come into prostitution, particularly those who do so at a young age, needs to be addressed as a serious issue.  It is not a free choice for somebody to come into prostitution because it is the only opportunity for them to earn money as an alternative to drug trafficking or involvement in drugs.  It is about ensuring those young women have sustainable exit routes out of prostitution.  The research both Ms O'Connor and I did in the dignity project showed this is a multifaceted issue.  It is not just about demand; it is also about making sure of the protection for the women, the identification of exploitation and abuse and the criminalisation of the traffickers in order that it is not an isolated strategy and is one of many strategies.  Fundamentally, we come from the position that the targeting of young vulnerable women whether they are from developing countries is because of poverty, lack of education and a lack of knowledge about what is happening.

The Lithuanian Minister told me that they do not need to lock these girls up in vans and take them across borders in chains.  The reality is they deceive them about the glamorous life they will have in Ireland.  They go through Lithuania and come here thinking they will be models.  These are 16 and 17 year old girls.  Focusing on force and coercion and not looking at the vulnerability and risk factors, as Dr. Pillinger said, and the targeting of those vulnerabilities is very na&iuml;ve.  It is also very disingenuous to differentiate between girls who are trafficked and those who are not trafficked.  The reality is that when they end up in the circumstances in Ireland, they are in equally exploitative situations regardless of the means of entry.  I believe that Dr. Pillinger would agree with me that at a policy level in Europe there is a shift in seeing that continuum.  A recent report referred to it as a continuum of predatory practices.  Rather than simply saying there is this very clear division, it is a whole continuum of coercion.  It is very rare that on reaching 21 a person wakes up and says: \"Today is the day I won't go to medical school and will go down to the local brothel.\"  The continuum is very important in regard to coercion and also in terms of choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600018#V01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Monica O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358354400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I will allow one final question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600019#W00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1358354400,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I have a question for Dr. McGarry.

As I mentioned in my presentation, there are a variety of experiences of sex workers involved in the sex industry.  Not every person involved in the sex industry is exploited.  Not every person has the same entry route or pathway into prostitution.  People engage in prostitution for a range of reasons.  As I said in response to a previous question, by failing to make a qualitative distinction between the violence of a society that forces somebody into the sex trade and however we might describe that, and violence as perpetrated against individuals in the sex trade - those who are enslaved in the sex trade, exploited in the sex trade, trafficked into the sex trade and so on - we limit the opportunity to intervene in those cases because if everything is regarded as exploitation, how do we identify real exploitation?  While we do not have the numbers to quantify that, if a number of women argue they are involved voluntarily and engage in sex work independently without coercion or exploitation, and we paint it all with the same brush, then we are denying the supports and services that should be targeted at real victims of exploitation and enslavement.  For that purpose and given the range of evidence internationally which supports the notion, we should separate sex work from trafficking in terms of our responses because, otherwise, the issue gets completely blurred and we cannot intervene for those who are really at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2013011600019#W00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Kathryn McGarry"},{"type":"speech","time":1358354400,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Why would somebody at the age of 21 or 22 decide to take that path?
