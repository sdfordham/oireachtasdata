A total of 92% of the expenditure fell under the housing, water services and community and rural development programmes.  At programme level, the most significant reduction year-on-year was in the area of housing, where spending fell by &euro;94 million compared to 2012.  The provision for the housing programme in 2013 was almost &euro;77 million, or 11%, less than the previous year&rsquo;s outturn.  In addition, expenditure in 2013 was almost &euro;17 million or 3% less than the amount provided.  The underspend in the year was attributed primarily to a lower than expected take-up by approved housing bodies of funding available under the capital assistance and capital advance leasing facility schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Spending under the vote on the water services programme was almost &euro;52 million less than provided in the Estimate.  This was attributed to difficulties encountered by contractors in securing necessary bonds, issues with contributions from local authorities to project costs and a need to progress the water sector reform programme.  As the committee is aware, responsibility for the funding of most water services passed to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014.  <\/p>  <p>  The main receipts recorded in the 2013 appropriation account were &euro;62 million provided by the EU under the LEADER rural economy sub-programme and treated as appropriations in aid of the Vote  and &euro;43 million of extra Exchequer receipts under the EU emissions trading scheme.  The net surplus on the Vote at the end of 2013 amounted to &euro;120 million.  With the approval of the Minister for Finance, capital funding of &euro;72 million not spent in 2013 was carried over to 2014.  The remaining &euro;48 million was duly surrendered to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  My audit certificate refers to three chapters in my report on the accounts of the public services related to the Vote.  In February last, the Committee examined the chapters dealing with matters related to water services and the land aggregation scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  As in previous years, chapter 5 was compiled to present an overview of the level of funding provided by central Government to local authorities and the purposes for which that funding is provided.  Relevant information has to be drawn together from a number of accounts to get a full picture of the transfers and of trends over time.  In 2013, transfers of funding from central Government sources to local authorities totalled around &euro;2.4 billion.  The bulk of the transfers came from the local government fund, Vote 25, Environment, Community and Local Government and Vote 31, Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The local government fund, which is also administered by the Department, was financed mainly by motor tax receipts, which totalled &euro;1.1 billion in the year.<\/p>  <p>  Central Government transfers to local authorities in 2013 represented just over 40 % of the figure for 2008 when transfers peaked at around &euro;5.8 billion.  That decline reflects both the overall reduction in public expenditure since 2008 and the transfer of certain responsibilities from local authorities.  The reduction in transfers has impacted on local authority capital spending in particular.<\/p>  <p>  Special report number 84 was completed in July 2014.  The report is the result of an initiative under which national audit offices in eight EU member states, including my own office, carried out coordinated audits of the implementation and enforcement of the 2006 European Waste Shipment Regulation, which sets out the rules for cross-border shipment of waste within, to and from the EU area.  <\/p>  <p>         The regulation covers classification of all types of waste, a system for licensing carriers and the notification of waste movements, as well as an inspection and enforcement regime for waste handling and transport facilities.  <\/p> <p> Under the regulation, the Department has overall policy responsibility for waste management.  It assigned overall responsibility for implementation of the regulation in Ireland to Dublin City Council, effectively giving the council a national remit.  The council has established the National Transfrontier Shipment Office, NTFSO, to implement and enforce the regulation and that office has contracted out certain aspects of the enforcement regime to a private sector service provider.<\/p> <p> The co-ordinated audit established that, in terms of the structures and resources available for enforcement, Ireland compared favourably relative to other states.  It was the only one of the states examined to have established a dedicated national implementation and enforcement body.  Ireland ranked second highest of the eight countries examined in terms of the number of inspections carried out at waste facilities and ports.  However, the number of inspections has fallen significantly.  The 3,200 inspections carried out in 2013 represented a 35% decrease on the peak level of 4,900 inspections in 2011.  We also found that the rate of detection of infringements during inspections of waste imports and exports had fallen from 16% in 2012 to 6% in 2013.  It is unclear whether the decline is due to improved compliance or less effective inspections.<\/p> <p> The regulation requires member states to implement an effective system to penalise infringements.  In comparison with other countries, it was found that Ireland issued a relatively large number of warning letters in respect of minor infringements.  However, the number of infringements leading to fines or legal actions was relatively low.  The report recommends that, in addition to its risk-based inspections, the NTFSO carry out sufficient random checks and use the results to estimate the overall level of compliance with the waste shipment regulation.  It also recommends that the Department ensure an enforcement strategy is developed to set the strategic direction for enforcement activity over a three to five year timeline.<\/p> <p> The special report also deals with a programme in which the State is engaged to repatriate a significant volume of waste, originating south of the Border, that was dumped in 16 illegal waste sites in Northern Ireland between 2002 and 2004.  The direct costs incurred by the State in respect of five site clearances completed by the end of 2012 totalled just over &euro;5.4 million.  The costs per tonne at the sites where clearance was completed during 2012 were significantly lower than the cost for the sites cleared earlier.  This is primarily due to the lower unit rates for waste disposal available under a framework contract established by the NTFSO.  The report recommends that the Department consider the potential for procurement initiatives to produce savings for other classes of expenditure under the waste repatriation programme such as the transport of the waste to licensed facilities in Ireland.<\/p> <p> The report notes that the Environmental Protection Agency's office of environmental enforcement continues to examine material uncovered at the illegal dump sites in Northern Ireland with a view to identifying offenders and considering the potential for prosecutions.  There have been no prosecutions in Ireland to date in the current repatriation exercise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435222800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Deputy Patrick O'Donovan took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1435222800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

As requested, I have provided an advance briefing for the meeting and will, therefore, keep my opening comments short.<\/p>  <p>  The State's public finances moved further along the pathway towards sustainability in 2013.  A key challenge facing the Department in that year, in common with most other public bodies at the time, was the increased pressure on resources, both human and financial.  In overall terms, the Department's gross outturn in 2013, including a capital carryover from the previous year, was some 8% lower than the corresponding outturn in 2012. <\/p>  <p>  The Department had significant achievements in 2013 in delivering on key policies and programmes.  Our overall objectives were to improve the quality of life of citizens and communities, foster economic and social development and enhance environmental protection.  In 2013 a number of critical areas benefited from increased funding over the previous year.  They included certain local authority housing schemes and the Leader and PEACE programmes.  In overall terms, the Department was assigned more than 21% of the total Exchequer capital allocation in 2013, which went towards implementing major housing, water, rural development and other programmes.<\/p>  <p>  Total spending from the Vote on the various housing programmes, including the provision of social housing and improvement and regeneration measures, amounted to almost &euro;580 million in 2013.  This spend was used to meet housing needs through a range of programmes, including the local authority construction and acquisition programme, the approved housing body programme, leasing and the rental accommodation scheme.<\/p>  <p>  An ambitious programme of retrofitting and energy efficiency upgrading accelerated in 2013, with improvements to more than 13,000 local authority units from departmental funding of almost &euro;27 million.  In addition, more than 7,000 households were supported to live as independently as possible through the housing adaptation grants scheme for older people and people with a disability, at a total cost to the Exchequer of just over &euro;38 million.<\/p>  <p>  Significant water services investment continued in 2013, with some &euro;280 million spent by the Department on these services, including &euro;34 million on the rural water programme.  Prior to the transfer of responsibility for water services to Irish Water at the beginning of 2014, local authorities were responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure, with funding provided by the Department under the water services investment programme.  The final programme administered by the Department ran from 2010 to the end of 2013.  Under the programme in 2013, 55 major contracts were completed.  It comprised 38 water supply projects, including 21 water conservation projects and 17 wastewater projects. <\/p>  <p>  Intensive work also continued throughout 2013 on the organisational, financial, economic and environmental models for Irish Water and the relevant legislative framework, leading to the enactment of two water services Bills.  The first, enacted in March 2013, provided for the establishment of Irish Water on an interim basis and the roll-out of the nationwide domestic metering programme.  In December 2013 the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provided for the full establishment of Irish Water and the economic regulation of the new utility. <\/p>  <p>  During 2013 funding of &euro;82 million was provided under axes 3 and 4 of the Leader rural development programme, RDP, resulting in 1,301 infrastructural enhancements in villages and communities across the country and support for 786 new tourism actions.  Enterprise support funding was provided under a number of RDP programme measures, resulting in the creation of 1,121 full-time jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Funding of some &euro;48 million was provided for local development bodies for the delivery of the local and community development programme, LCDP, in 2013.  During the year the LCDP supported close to 50,000 people in entering the labour market.  This number included some 19,700 people progressing into labour market training and more than 7,400 individuals progressing into employment or self-employment as a result of LCDP actions. <\/p>  <p>  The chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report on the central government funding of local authorities provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income since 2006, detailing the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible and the range of funding sources.  Transfers of funding from central government sources to local authorities in 2013 totalled some &euro;2.36 billion. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of accountability, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, provides for independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  It audits local government bodies in accordance with a statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.  Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, a local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement and any associated statutory audit report to all members of the local authority for their consideration at the next practicable council meeting.  <\/p>  <p>           The Government's action programme for effective local government, in addition to providing for an expanded role for the local government system, particularly in terms of community and local economic development, recognised the need to enhance scrutiny arrangements.  A significant development in this regard has been the establishment of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, bringing an important added dimension of independent scrutiny to local government performance.  The NOAC will scrutinise local government performance in fulfilling national, regional and local mandates, scrutinise value for money where State funds are channelled through local government, and support the development of best practice and enhanced efficiency in the performance of local government functions.<\/p> <p> The final item on the agenda today is the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the transhipment of waste.  As members will be aware, the report reviews the implementation and enforcement of the European waste shipment regulation in Ireland.  It also reports on the discovery of waste originating from Ireland at a number of unlicensed sites in Northern Ireland, associated costs incurred and progress achieved in repatriating the waste.  The report makes a number of recommendations which have been taken on board by the Department.<\/p> <p> The Department established a single authority to implement and enforce the European waste shipment regulation.  This authority, the National TransFrontier Shipment Office, NTFSO, has played a central role in the implementation of the waste framework directive, the waste shipment regulation and national waste policy.  The primary focus is on maximising the resource that can be extracted from waste and developing a sustainable and self-sufficient approach to the management of our waste in accordance with the proximity principle.  As a general rule, waste should be dealt with as near to the place of generation as possible.<\/p> <p> The establishment of the NTFSO has been a success.  It has driven significant efficiencies, improved cost-effectiveness in the sector and streamlined service delivery to industry.  The office has also improved compliance with respect to the import and export of waste.  Inspections undertaken by the NTFSO in 2013 indicate a compliance rate of 94% with the requirements of the waste shipment regulation.  While managing the movement of waste across the Border remains challenging, these achievements are worthy of note.<\/p> <p> The report makes a number of recommendations to improve further the performance of Ireland&rsquo;s implementation arrangements for the waste shipment regulation.  These are welcome and I am glad to say that the recommendations have either been acted upon since publication of the report or are actively in train.  One of the recommendations relates to ensuring the costs of the North-South waste repatriation programme are minimised.  This is one of the legacies from a time of less rigorous environmental enforcement on both sides of the Border, and further costs associated with repatriation will arise in the years ahead.  The Department continues to engage with the Northern Ireland authorities proactively to secure the most cost-effective and environmentally beneficial disposal routes for the waste still to be excavated from the remaining sites.  I am glad to note that procurement initiatives taken by the NTFSO, in line with recommendations in the report, are already realising significant cost savings.<\/p> <p> The matters I have referred to illustrate well the broad range of programmes and activities for which my Department has responsibility.  I am, of course, happy to respond to questions on these and other issues that emerge in the course of the committee's work today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435222800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I wish to ask about a few specific topics.  I am interested in one in particular, as are most Oireachtas Members, having served some time in local government.<\/p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General laid out the figures.  From the Central Fund, the local government fund and subventions from the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Transport, Tourism and Sport, approximately &euro;2.4 billion went to local authorities in 2013.  From the other documentation provided, we can see that the income of local authorities that year was in the region of &euro;6 billion.  Some 60% of their funding came from other sources, but we have no picture of that.  It did not come through the Department's Vote.  As the Accounting Officer of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which is the mother Department of local authorities, Mr. McCarthy might discuss the 60%.  He can forward to us a general breakdown of it if he does not have the information with him.  For example, what is the breakdown between commercial rates, development levies, planning fees, parking fees, housing rent, housing loan repayments, landfill fees, fire service charges and other miscellaneous income?<\/p>  <p>  An issue that constantly arises for the committee is that we only get a bit of the picture.  We are not the audit group of local authorities.  However, given that &euro;2.4 billion of voted funding is going to local authorities, we want to know that it is being well spent.  We can only know that if we know the totality of what is happening.  How does Mr. McCarthy know that the &euro;2.4 billion is spent on the projects the Department has identified, given that it probably goes into a large pot with a lot of other moneys raised by local authorities?  The Department receives headings subsequently as to where money was spent, but there is no separate stream through which it can trace that funding once the cheque is sent.  Am I right in that regard?  Does Mr. McCarthy get my question?  It is broad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#L00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I understand fully where the Deputy is coming from in this regard.  In the first instance, we rely on the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, and the audits it conducts.  They form a crucial part of the architecture in terms of ensuring expenditure in local government is incurred appropriately and efficiently.  Capital funding is more closely associated with individual projects, meaning there would be greater bilateral engagement between local authorities and us or other Departments, including Transport, Tourism and Sport in respect of road projects.  There would be a specific relationship.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the wider funding of local authorities, for example, the commercial rates and housing loans and rents the Deputy mentioned, each year the LGAS produces what it calls an activity report whereby it pulls together the outcome of the audits for all the main local authorities into a single report.  This gives us an overall national perspective of the performance of local authorities under a range of headings, including the specific income sources to which the Deputy referred.  It provides the Department a platform to engage with local authorities as necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of commercial rates.  Their collection level concerns everyone, not least the local authorities themselves.  In recent years and partly influenced by the economic downturn, the rate of collection has been declining.  In 2009, the collection rate was approximately 86%.  In 2013, it was 77%.  Interestingly, 2013 was the first time in four or five years that one could see the percentage rate starting to rise again.  Another point worthy of note is that this percentage is not just the percentage of the rates levied in the year but also of the arrears.  If one were to strip out the arrears, which have to be pursued, one would see that the actual in-year level of collection was higher.<\/p>  <p>  While it is welcome that the level of rates collection is rising, it still has a long way to go.  It is at 77%.  An exercise was done centrally, led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, regarding debt collection generally within the public sector.  That was completed last year.  Arising from it, various initiatives are being taken forward in the individual sectors, including local government.  A specific group has been set up within that sector to take on rates as a first area of concerted activity.  In partnership with the sector, we are in a process of trying to set a target of a progressive 2% to 2.5% increase in the collection level per annum, supported by a sharing of best practice.  There is significant variation across local authorities.  We are trying to avoid reinventing the wheel by taking best practice from where it can be gleaned.<\/p>  <p>  The other significant matter the Deputy mentioned, and it is one that is worthy of particular note, is that of loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435222800,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Housing loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#L00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>It is a matter on which we keep a close eye.  We know a great deal about the private mortgage market and the extent of arrears arising there.  <\/p>  <p>         Local authorities also have an historic loan book relating to house purchases.  The collection level for loans in 2013 was 69%.  As things stand, in terms of the latest data available, there has been some element of improvement over the last 12 months but there are still approximately 5,800 local authority mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days.  That represents approximately 31% of the total number of local authority loans, which is significantly higher than the corresponding figure in the private mortgage market, which stands at around 10% or 11%.  We are now engaged in a process, working through the local authorities, which is the equivalent of a mortgage arrears resolution process.  The local government system is going through those 5,725 mortgages that are in arrears of more than 90 days.  Each local authority is sitting down with each of those loan holders to try to work out the best solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435222800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>We understand that and we all understand there may be a higher level of unemployment in the client base than is the case in the private mortgage sector.  We understand that and, as public representatives, we all deal with it every day.<\/p><p>The Central Bank criticised seven financial institutions yesterday for continuing to take other actions against people, even when arrangements were in place.  If the Central Bank was to examine the local authority system, it would probably find a much worse situation.  The standard practice in local authorities when they have a restructuring agreement in place is to keep the court case live and to keep adjourning it, just in case the client slips behind in payments.  If they put an agreement in place and withdraw court proceedings but the client falls behind in payments, the process involved in bringing the case back to court can be long drawn out.  I would just make the observation that it is not just private sector operators who are continuing to take other actions against people.  It seems to be standard practice and perhaps for good reason, in the interests of the taxpayer.  <\/p><p>Mr. McCarthy made reference to a financial report from the local government auditor.  When will we see the first report from the aforementioned national oversight and audit commission?  I ask Mr. McCarthy to send on copies of the last report he referred to.  I note that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states that the collation of local authority expenditure outturns for 2013 were not finalised at the time he wrote his report.  If they have been finalised since, I ask that they be sent on to the committee.  <\/p><p>On commercial rates, I accept that the nominal rates have not been increased by most local authorities and there may even have been a decrease in one or two cases.  That said, in 2013 commercial rates represented 34% of income for local authorities, rising to 36% in 2014 and is projected to reach 38% this year.  While that is probably a reflection of other income going down, I ask the Department to give us a ten year figure for commercial rates as a percentage of total local authority income.  The data for the three years to which I have referred show a shocking increase.  We all talk about helping small businesses but when we look at the stark facts, we see that the percentage of local authority income coming from commercial rates is increasing year on year.  <\/p><p>On the issue of waste, we now have three regions in the country.  Submissions were completed at the end of January and we are meeting our target of 45% recycling, which is good, and landfill of 39%.  However, I received a document last night called The State of Ireland 2015, A Review of Infrastructure in Ireland by Engineers Ireland.  It goes through various infrastructure in Ireland, including communications, transport, waste management and so forth and grades it.  On waste management the report states that &quot;the management of waste in Ireland is being kept in equilibrium by the exporting of black bin waste&quot;.  The authors go on to argue:<\/p><blockquote>the current trend of exporting residual municipal (and hazardous) wastes for treatment to waste-to-energy, incineration and cement kilns in other European member<br \/><br \/>states reflects the State&rsquo;s inability to date to adequately manage its own residual wastes.  The export solution is providing short-term gains, in terms of diverting waste from landfill<\/blockquote>  <p>That is possibly why we are meeting our landfill targets; we are putting the waste on ships.  It is a dishonest approach to say we are great because we have reduced the amount of waste that is going to landfill when we are just putting our waste in landfill sites in other countries.  We are exporting our waste but, as a country, we should be able to deal with our own waste.  I am sure the witnesses will tell us that there are some waste recovery projects due to come on stream.  <\/p><p>I ask the witnesses to provide figures on the amount, in kilos, of waste produced by the average household here.  My biggest issue is that despite the statistics we have on what is going to landfill, what is being recycled and so forth, I suspect that up to 50% of households in the country are not involved in the official waste management system at all.  I know that where I live, for example, there was a time when everyone used to be able to afford a bin.  Now a wheelie bin costs &euro;360 per year, which is phenomenal and I can understand why householders do not bother any more.  They throw their waste in the back garden, on the side of the road or dump it anywhere they can.  The biggest issue and the elephant in the room, which is never captured by our statistics, is the amount of waste that is not coming into the official waste management system at all.  It is lovely to talk about what is in the system but I am far more concerned about what is not in the system and is being buried in drains, ditches and bogs.  The main reason is that the cost is prohibitive.  If a wheelie bin was affordable, we would have a massive uptake but it is not affordable for many people.  It is also almost immoral that we are dumping our landfill waste in China, England, the Netherlands and elsewhere.  That is not a good idea.  I ask the witnesses to address those points before we deal with the Northern Ireland transshipment issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#M00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I will loop back to the rates issue before dealing with the questions on waste.  It is important to bear in mind that the 2015 percentages are estimated on the basis of budgets and may not be the correct final figure.  I suspect there is an element of economic buoyancy in the figures, to the extent that there has been a pick-up in economic activity with new businesses establishing.  There was some analysis done of the 2012 rates income and from memory, 80% of businesses that paid rates in 2012 in the Dublin City Council area had a rates bill of less than &euro;5,000 per annum.  That means there is a smaller number of larger entities that are paying a very significant amount in commercial rates.  As the Deputy said himself, part of the change in the percentage is explained by the fact that revenue from other sources has been contracting.  That said, in overall terms, the rate of commercial rates levied has not increased for four or five years, with only one or two exceptions.  In a few cases, the rates actually came down.<\/p>  <p>  The 2013 overall national report is publicly available and we will send on a copy to the committee.  It is on our website and is a very useful platform for us.  We take it as a baseline document for guiding some of our engagements with local authorities on the financial side of things as we progress through the year.  We will certainly make a copy of that report available to the Deputy.  In terms of the extent to which waste is going abroad, it is not so much for landfill but primarily for energy recovery.  It is going into cement kilns or thermal treatment facilities.  <\/p>  <p>         That is not a sustainable way to deal with our waste from two points of view.  First, the potential for recovering energy is lost to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1435222800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>Deputy John McGuinness took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1435222800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>And the jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#N00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Second, it leaves us exposed to the vagaries of facilities in other countries.

It will take possibly up to &euro;30 million to sort out the problems arising from illegal dumping outside the State.  To me, it represents a phenomenal failure by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in protecting the environment that we have to spend up to &euro;80 million of Irish taxpayers' money on cleaning up the illegal dumping that happened under everybody's eyes.  One could not drive from Dublin to Cork via Naas without knowing something illegal was happening there for years on end.  We all know the cost of what happened.  We all saw the smoke for many years.  Simultaneously, landfill levies of &euro;75 per tonne were imposed.  Perhaps somebody thought that was a good idea to discourage people from going to landfill. However, it incentivised people to move from official landfill sites to illegal landfill sites on the island of Ireland, which we now have to spend &euro;80 million cleaning up.  By definition, most of those guys were cowboys, if that is what they were doing, and everybody knows what they were doing.  As I am sure they are long gone, it will be impossible to get any money from them.  Therefore, the prospect of recovering any of that money is very slim.  Are there any similar problems in the system that will hit us again in the next few years?

It was 1996, with the introduction of the Waste Management Act in that year, before we had what we could legitimately say was a modern legislative framework to govern waste all the way from collection through to treatment and disposal.  Already there was 20 years of catching up to be done.  As we moved on we took some progressive steps around waste management plans in terms of what we wanted to achieve.  We set out clear targets for recycling and recovery.  We are now at the level of European norms.  As the Deputy rightly said, it gives me no pleasure to sit here and speak about the extent of public funds going into Kerdiffstown and places across the Border in terms of dealing with the waste that was taken to the North illegally.  It is a legacy issue.  In terms of the Northern Ireland situation and the repatriation of waste, we have completed work on ten out of the 17 sites, which represents about 86,000 tonnes of waste, at a cost of about &euro;7 million.

Is there a mechanism to monitor that, which I suspect there is not, or is such funding simply a general contribution?  With sports lottery grants, people can see the completion of a running track, a sports track or a community facility.  Such a project is specifically identified and a grant of &euro;100,000, &euro;5,000 or &euro;40,000 is allocated for it, whereas with this funding I get the impression that a social housing programme would have got X amount of it.

In effect, there were two cases where we found ourselves at the receiving end of fines for non-implementation.  To put it in context, going back to 2010 or 2011, we were at that stage managing in excess of 30 live infringements of EU environmental legislation.  Going back to what I said earlier about the legacy we were dealing with in regard to waste, these were similar legacy issues.  We have put in a huge effort during the past three or four years, both from a transposition and a practical implementation point of view, to try to deal with that.  The remaining number of cases we are managing, I think, from memory, is six, so they have been significantly reduced.  One of those is a very large waste case which is tied into some of the issues we discussed earlier and which we expect the Commission will close later this year because of the progress made.  Unfortunately, there were two cases where by the time the work associated with completing transposition and implementation was finished, the court had completed its work and had given a judgment against us.  One of them was, as the Deputy said, in the application of the environmental impact assessment directive - a particular part of it.  By the time it came to levying the fine, we had our house in order, so that was a lump sum fine.  There was no ongoing daily fine.  That was &euro;1.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  On the septic tanks fine, similarly, we were almost there, so the lump sum element of it was, from memory, &euro;2 million and the ongoing daily fine was just shy of &euro;650,000.  One issue was still outstanding, so there was a daily fine applied for a period of about three months.  We have no other cases at this stage that are at a fines stage before the European Court of Justice.  From an environmental compliance and a quality of environment point of view, it is critical that we are not in that space but, equally, from a financial point of view, it is critical that we are not in that space.

I would say there is one and it is the issue of homelessness.  The Department is the organisation responsible for housing.  While we have come through a recession, we have come from a position where there was a requirement to have 30,000 houses per annum.  We were building more than that number for a few years and we had a surplus and there are unfinished estates and we could talk about that.  There are many vacant houses and many of them are being controlled by the banks and they will not let them to be sold until their value goes up.  The issue of family homelessness and children living in hostels and hotels has occurred in recent times and it was foreseeable for the past two years.  If I asked Mr. McCarthy on 1 January 2013, the start of the year under consideration, how many families were homeless in Ireland, I would say the figure was very few, but if I asked him what the figure is today, the number is such that it is a national shame.  That has happened and Mr. McCarthy's Department plus one other Department that is responsible for cutting rent supplement has created this issue of family homelessness.  It is not all as result of the big bad banks.  Some of these people might have been some of Department's tenants because it is as good as any of the banks, as I mentioned earlier, in going to court for evictions.  I suspect that if we added up the number of surrenders the Department has had, it would probably be as many as some of the banks.<\/p>  <p>  The Department was not ahead of the curve on this in recent years.  When Jonathan Corrie died outside the gates of the national Parliament last year, there was a big drive to act and two buildings were converted.  That is a sticking plaster in terms of what is needed.  That had to be done but an underlying problem has arisen, not when we were going into or during a recession but when we were coming out of one.  There is no excuse for the increase in the incidence of homelessness that we have seen on the streets and in the increase in the number of families with children living in hotels.  <\/p>  <p>               The Comptroller and Auditor General just mentioned that there was a &euro;94 million reduction in expenditure on housing in 2013 because somebody did not take up the funding.  That was indicative of whatever was happening in the system.  We looked at the figures for total expenditure and payments to local government.  Current expenditure has remained relatively static but, obviously, the drop has been in capital expenditure, which is on the housing side.  Mr. McCarthy cannot be satisfied.  The Department, which is responsible for housing, cannot come in here today and say it has done a good job on homelessness.  It should not be the issue that it is.  It is a new phenomenon that was foreseeable and avoidable.  I am not talking about houses in the Shannon region that people do not want.  There are good new houses for sale to local authorities priced &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 all over the country.  Perhaps they are not in Dublin 2 or Dublin 4 but they are all over Ireland.  The Department could house any amount of families at the moment for a minimal amount of money.  As Mr. McCarthy knows, prices are starting to rise dramatically this year and the Department will be able to buy far fewer houses with the same amount of money next year.  Could Mr. McCarthy give me his thoughts?  I will revisit this issue because the political and permanent government systems have let the citizens down when it comes to homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#O01500","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I suppose everybody would agree that any person or any family finding themselves homeless is not in a good place.  We have certainly been pulling out all the stops over a number of years to deal with this issue.  In respect of anticipating the issue, budgets were significantly reduced every year since 2008 for reasons we all understand.  The housing budget was reduced until 2015, when it was significantly increased.  On the one hand, there was a large number of empty units and our budget had historically been very heavily focused on capital build and buy.  We reoriented our approach towards meeting housing needs very significantly in response to the economic downturn.  In the short to medium term, it allowed us to stretch the available resources through current mechanisms to be able to house more households than if we were putting the money up-front into capital schemes.  The reality was that there was an oversupply of accommodation in 2008, 2009 and 2010, much of which was available at a good price both for rent and purchase.  We did a very significant reorientation of our housing funding programmes.  If we had not done so, the situation would be considerably worse.  That is cold comfort for people who find themselves homeless and I do not mean to use it to justify that.  I am just providing the context regarding how we changed our approach to meeting housing needs.<\/p>  <p>  Looking at it in its broadest sense, the fundamental issue is a lack of supply in the housing market.  This is translating into increases in house prices and rents.  The Government has put the Construction 2020 strategy in place for the housing sector to free up more land and bring it into play for housing.  Legislation is before the House at the moment that is designed to assist in that process, but Construction 2020 encompasses a range of actions to get housing supply levels back up to a better position.  However, until such time as we can restore equilibrium in the wider housing market, we must devote more resources towards dealing with families presenting as homeless and trying to provide short-terms solutions before moving on to longer-term solutions.  The roll-out of the social housing strategy, which was published by the Government in the autumn of 2014, is kicking in this year.  The significant increase in resources will assist us in that regard.  A significant increase in funding is being provided in respect of homelessness, but that involves shorter-term solutions.  It is the broader increase in financial resources for housing programmes and social housing programmes more generally that will provide us with the medium to longer-term solutions.  We work exceptionally closely with Dublin local authorities practically on a weekly basis, keeping the situation under review, modifying our approaches, introducing new initiatives such as giving priority to homeless households in allocations policy and the provision of additional resources to source accommodation in the rental and acquisitions markets.  Even in Dublin, there are still some places where one can acquire property at good value.  There are many places in the country where, from a value-for-money perspective, acquisitions would provide one with better capacity and a better return in the short term than building.  Nevertheless, a significant building programme has now been announced and is moving on.  It had been the focus of considerable attention for a number of years to ensure that we did not get into a difficult situation.  We are in the situation we are in right now, but had we not changed our approach five years ago-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435222800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>What change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#P00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>It related primarily to the extent to which we moved towards current funded mechanisms-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435222800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Does Mr. McCarthy mean rent supplement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#P00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>No, not rent supplement.

We have been in discussions with Monaghan County Council and are funding a pilot programme of sampling abandoned laundering waste material.

Foremen within the county councils will say that they have still not sorted out their boundaries.  There is a row over budgets.  The urban centres that are associated, for example, Kilkenny city versus county, are not functioning as they should.  It is almost impossible for the elected members to do their business in each of these electoral areas.  From a people's perspective, they believe that they have been short-changed in relation to the structure of local government.  It is becoming a real issue politically for people who are tapped in to local communities and local government.<\/p>  <p>  I draw Mr. McCarthy's attention to the statement made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in which he raised doubts about how the new system was working.  From my perspective and through dealing with this committee, I wonder about the costs involved in all that in terms of the changes that are being made, the regrading, and the spending and division of the budgets.  How well is that division of the budget serving local communities?  Are we getting real value for money or are further moneys being taken from the top to feed into bureaucracy at local levels?  Is less being spent on the various programmes of work within the local authority areas?  I suggest to Mr. McCarthy that if he asked most councillors and, indeed, most officials, if they were to be straight with him, they would raise a huge number of questions over what is now going on at local government level.  My concern, apart from the value for money aspect, is that it has disconnected local communities from what they had before in terms of their sense of local democracy and their input and their importance within it.<\/p>  <p>  I use the example of Kilkenny Borough Council versus Kilkenny County Council again.  The geographical areas that the foremen and engineers within council areas are asked to service are just ridiculous.  I know that is not Mr. McCarthy's call but I am giving him feedback on it.  The budgets of urban areas have been cut so significantly that local authority employees do not have the range of work to do.  That is a serious problem.  It is not just about the structures and the political administration or the work for councillors, it is about the administration of those areas.  There was a comparison made to Cromwell in Kilkenny, which I do not want to repeat here, but something like that was mentioned, to the effect he did less damage than this local government Bill.  I will discuss this further with Mr. McCarthy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#V02500","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Please do, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#V02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1435222800,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. McCarthy and his team.  On the funding of local government, when one looks at the graph of the allocation of funding, one sees that there has been a dramatic drop since 2008 and I think that has impacted on the level of services.  While there has been a subvention of funding, the &euro;2.4 billion now is considerably less than the &euro;5.8 billion in 2008.  There is a real deficit or shortfall.<\/p>  <p>  Will Mr. McCarthy explain the situation on the status of the gateway cities?  <\/p>  <p>               There was a huge investment programme by the Department in Sligo predicated on the population in the region growing from 20,000 to 100,000.  Mr. McCarthy's Department encouraged the necessary adjustment and spend which resulted in huge inherited debt which is now left on the books of local authorities.  Every service was put in, encouraged, designed and promoted by the Department and the debt has been left with the local authority. There is now a huge deficit in Sligo County Council where services and essential services are being cut and libraries are being closed.  I understand they have spoken with Mr. Lemass but this huge debt was promoted by the Department, taken on board by the CEO of the council at the time and driven by the Department, yet there is no retribution at all.  The local authorities are expected to service this debt and it is cutting back services.<\/p> <p> A case was taken in Sligo which went to the Supreme Court.  It was encouraged by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and its officials who are witnesses in the case, and which will cost &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million in legal costs alone.  The local authority is duty bound by the State and the Department and the Government.  This case will set a precedent on rights of way which were deemed to be local authority but were proven, in court, to be private.  That legal bill has to be paid by the local authority.  Should it not be paid by the Department? The payment of this legal bill will result in the removal of practically every service in the area.  Will Mr. McCarthy comment on this?<\/p> <p> The gateway status was a very ambitious plan at the time but the insight or the vision behind it was very much misguided.  It was based on the concept that one could quadruple a population in a region of the west.  Could the Department advise on how local authorities are to deal with this huge debt? Even with the local property tax, the distribution by the State of motor taxation and what was given by the Exchequer in 2008, I believe that local authorities have a major problem of funding.  In a small population with a small ratable base there is no point in saying we are giving back the LPT or matching the equivalent fund.  It is different in Dublin and it is not equivalent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#V02700","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Sligo and a number of other locations were designated as gateways under the national spatial strategy which was launched 13 years ago in 2002.  The world changed dramatically for everybody in 2007 and 2008, which necessitated a significant process of retrenchment and efficiency across the local government system and public bodies.  Staffing reductions, for example, in local government over the period 2008-14 were significant, at 28% to 29%.  All local authorities had to implement measures to balance their financial situation.  During that period the Department took a number of initiatives to assist local authorities before we found ourselves not having the resources to sustain some of those, but we did make efforts.

It is outrageous and if it was a business, they would step in immediately and attempt to rescue it.  We have abandoned not just transparency and accountability but also our traditions, our heritage and all that local government stood for.  I know we should not comment on policy here but I think it is an appalling policy and it is one that will have to be reversed, undoubtedly, at some stage.  That is my personal view.<\/p>  <p>  An issue involving Meath County Council and dumping was raised at this committee previously.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport were involved in the discussion because it related to road construction.  Everyone is now running a million miles away from that problem and no one seems to want to resolve it.  The latest twist in the story is that the individual who owns the site in question and on whose lands significant amounts of material was dumped, is now being asked for significant sums of money from the FOI section in the council in his efforts to resolve what was a wrongdoing by somebody in local government, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or somewhere.  Is there anything Mr. McCarthy can do to determine exactly what the current position is in regard to this matter?  It involves the Departments of Environment, Community and Local Government and Transport, Tourism and Sport and a citizen.  It appears that the State is using its considerable muscle and understanding of the system to give this individual the runaround.  All he wants is for whoever allegedly wrongly dumped material on the site to sort it out but he cannot get to first base with the local authority or with anyone else.  In terms of serving the citizen, is there any possibility that someone from the local authority would intervene in some way and give him some direction as to the course he should take?  I am not referring here to legal action but the course he should take to try to resolve the matter.  Who is the decision maker in this process?  We talked earlier about the transportation of material to Northern Ireland, illegal dumping and compensation of &euro;30 million and here we have an individual who is trying to resolve matters and cannot do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015062500002#Y01200","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435222800,"counter":384,"content":"<p>This is an enforcement issue associated with suggestions of illegal dumping.

Deputy Sean Fleming raised the issue of homelessness in the context of the work done in refurbishing houses.

I know from my constituency which covers two counties, Carlow and Kilkenny, that there is an unacceptably high number of local authority houses that are not occupied.  I also know that at any one time up to ten families can be placed in a hotel in Kilkenny and that more is being paid to accommodate people in a hotel than would have been paid if they had remained in rented accommodation paid for by the State.

So I'll cover, in essentially chronological order, matters that were dealt with in my written statement.  First, the recapitalisation of the banks in 2010 in the context of NAMA purchases, then the September 2010 bank funding cliff, the move to the EU-IMF programme in November 2010 - which, understandably, is this afternoon's topic but I'll cover it all in one ... remarks today - the programme structure and, finally, the improved funding conditions which helped to make the programme a success.  I will conclude with a few remarks about institutional change.<\/p> <p>  So on recapitalisation of the banks, given the existence of the watertight guarantee enacted through the CIFS legislation of October 2008, in designing policy with regard to bank capitalisation I was guided by a fixed principle, informed by the Central Bank's statutory mandate, that any event of default by a bank - as would trigger a large cash call on the State - was to be avoided in view of the financial instability that this would cause.  In practice, this implied that the Central Bank had to ensure that all of the guaranteed banks would continue to maintain regulatory capital compliant with international standards.  This would help ensure that they had access to the ECB standard liquidity facilities as well as, where necessary, ELA.  As the NAMA purchases would necessarily be staggered over a period of months, the Central Bank decided to take the announcement of the valuations of the first tranche of NAMA loan purchases as the occasion to establish the necessary capital infusions for Allied ... for AIB, Bank of Ireland and EBS, the going concern guaranteed banks selling loans into NAMA.<\/p> <p>  When they became available late March 2010, the initial NAMA valuations, based only on the handful of exposures that had been fully valued in time for that date ... these entailed much higher percentage losses than had been generally expected by industry specialists.  So the capital requirements announced by the Central Bank at the end of March 2010 - in what was known as PCAR 2010 - assumed that all of the NAMA purchases would involve haircuts as large as the first tranche.  They  also took account of forward-looking loss estimates in a base case and stress scenario of the non-NAMA books.  For example, a flat 5% loan loss estimate much higher than that assumed by the banks' managements themselves was applied to the residential mortgage portfolios.  Given the prevailing uncertainty surrounding these badly impaired portfolios, there was still a large margin of error which might eventually consume the apparent surplus above the international minima ... the international capital standard minima.  Unfortunately, the later tranches of NAMA purchases which became available in August and September did imply much higher losses, with the result that additional capital requirements had to be announced in September for AIB and also for Anglo at that time - in that case because of Anglo management's estimate of additional costs implied by the wind-down plan that the Government had just already announced in the same month.<\/p> <p>  Now, the September 2010 bank funding cliff.  Faced with a steep cliff of bank liabilities ... liability maturities in September 2010, I gave some consideration to possible alternative courses of action which might be recommended to Government.  As explained in my written statement, the only safe way forward seemed to continue to rely on ELA while also pursuing all possible steps to rebuild confidence and recognising that recourse to an IMF programme would be the fall-back position.  By that month, September 2010, most informed international observers began to factor in a likely need for Ireland to enter a programme of official financial assistance.  The main influences were the perspective rapid increase in ELA - due to the funding cliff, which arose because it was the end of the initial guarantee period - and the growing evidence that the Government's multi-year fiscal plan at that stage would not stabilise the debts ... the State's debt dynamics.  The drip feed of bad news about bank recapitalisation needs did not help.<\/p> <p>  Now, the move to the EU-IMF programme: by 4 November 2010, when spreads on ten-year bonds exceeded 500 basis points or five percentage points and depositor outflows were accelerating, also reflecting a loss of confidence, it was clear to me that application for a programme could no longer safely be deferred and by, well, the following week, I guess, 11 November, the Minister for Finance had agreed to exploratory discussions with troika officials in Brussels.<\/p><p>Delayed until 14 November, apparently because of the need for the troika to agree a strategy among themselves - though that's conjecture, I guess - these discussions, attended by about 20 Irish officials, confirmed that there was a basis for full negotiations on a programme which, with the approval of the Minister, began in Dublin on 18 November.  These meetings took place in an increasingly tense situation of national and international media speculation, market tensions, which had brought the yield on Irish Government ten-year bonds above 8% and considerable international official alarm at the highest levels.<\/p><p> So, on the structure I would just say the following, the EU-IMF programme structure, the programme finally agreed with the troika, it largely reflected the four-year budgetary plan which was published by the Government at the outset of the negotiations, or during the course of the negotiations might be more precise.  Indeed, in the negotiations, the target date for reaching the threshold deficit level of 3% of GDP was pushed back to 2015.  But would the implied degree of fiscal adjustment be sufficient to bring the public finances back onto a sustainable path?  Here the remaining question mark over the banking system was key.  All in all, the Central Bank found the financial terms of the programme disappointing and unsatisfactory, especially in regard to the high interest rates and the lack of some kind of insurance mechanism against tail risks in the banks.  Nevertheless, it was crystal clear to me that no better terms could quickly be achieved.  Therefore, having set out these concerns, I advised the Government in writing that it should proceed on the basis of the programme, given that the alternative of struggling forward without access to market finance would have been more economically damaging.  If the programme proved unable to deliver a sustainable debt path, as seemed at that point possible, even likely, then the financial terms could probably be renegotiated.  It is a fact that, had programme funding not been availed of, much more severe spending and tax adjustments would have been needed.<\/p><p> Now, the better financing conditions that subsequently made the programme a success.  Indeed there were subsequent, considerable improvements in the terms of financing, not least through the reduction of EU interest rates from the initial level of about 5.7%, 5.8% per annum and the lengthening of the loan maturities and subsequently through the carefully designed financial arrangements around the liquidation of IBRC, especially the so-called promissory note exchange.  And these improvements, combined of course with close adherence to the budgetary targets in the following three years, allowed the Government to take the decision to exit the programme on schedule at the end of 2013.  Despite the risks and pressures involved at the outset, recourse to the EU-IMF loan proved to be a successful policy move for Ireland, limiting the need for fiscal austerity because funding was made available in amounts and at costs far below what the market would have offered and underpinning a relatively rapid return to confidence.  Successive Governments' adherence to the programme in difficult political circumstances helped restore Ireland's international reputation for disciplined macroeconomic management, a reputation essential for sustained recovery of employment and incomes.<\/p><p> So, just a few words on other aspects.  I ... clearly I've omitted a lot that could be said, including in particular on the areas of institutional reform that were introduced in the Central Bank since 2009 to enhance the bank's ability to deal with new tasks, as well as upgrading its capacity to deliver on the remainder of its mandate, having regard to the weaknesses that had been identified.  Very extensive changes in regulatory and supervising staffing, methodology and culture brought into the Central Bank, 2009 to 2013, have been documented in papers submitted by the Central Bank to the inquiry and I believe that the smooth transition of the prudential aspects of Ireland's supervision of banks to the ECB's single supervisory mechanism in November 2014 testifies to the credibility of the transformation that was achieved in those years.<\/p><p> On the rehabilitation and restructuring of banking in Ireland, I suppose the central banking, aside from the recapitalisation aspects in this period, I have spoken repeatedly to Oireachtas committees about the disappointingly slow progress in dealing with non-performing loans, especially, but not only, mortgage arrears.<\/p><p>Banks have now got reasonably effective systems in place to deal with collection and restructuring on the scale needed, but they did not introduce adequate system until chivvied or harassed by the Central Bank from late 2011.  The mortgage arrears targets introduced in early 2013 simplified a quantitative assessment of progress being made by the banks.  An increasing number of loan restructurings, designed to be fully sustainable, have been agreed.  Compliance with the restructured payment schedule is high, though deeper restructuring would be desirable, as it would arguably increase assurance that borrowers would not fall again into arrears and would also reduce debt overhang in the economy at large.  However, despite all of the efforts, including the initiation of court repossession proceedings, there is still insufficient engagement between borrower and lender in a large number of cases, resulting in lengthy delays, leave the borrowers in a limbo of over indebtedness and hamper both the borrowers' and the banks' ability to put the crisis behind them.<\/p><p> So, in conclusion, in the period under review the Central Bank has sought to help the Irish economy recover as much as possible from the calamitous economic and financial losses resulting from the collapse of the bank-driven boom.  As far as banking regulation and macro-prudential policy are concerned, these are complex and ever changing fields of endeavour, demanding skilled and committed officials.  The failures of the past provide lessons for the present, and at the Central Bank, we have tried to learn and apply those lessons. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Governor, thank you for our opening remarks.

He mapped out, first of all staffing.  He said \"You're way understaffed and you've got to separate the functions\".  Take enforcement, which is the question you're asking me, Chathaoirligh, enforcement has to be taken right away from supervision.  Of course, they have to talk to each other, the supervisors will feed the enforcers with information, but take it right away so that once the job has been identified, that there's a breach here that has to be followed up and pursued, that that will not now contaminate the day-to-day examination of ... forward-looking examination, and is taken to a directorate where specialist skills are applied to documenting the breach, deciding whether it's sufficient to warrant ... or what kind of action is warranted and then pursuing it.

And that's because, after the guarantee, as I understand it, the banks issued bonds and deposits to mature at or before ... shortly before the guarantee.  So it was well known this was going to be a cliff; so we're going to have to do something to build sufficient confidence in the banking system that the depositors, when they get to the end of September, will say, \"Oh yeah we'll just roll that over for another year\".  That's, of course, what we failed to do.  But what did we ... how did we try to do it?  We tried to do it by getting a ... convince ... to take the uncertain bad loans from the property developers - which were the big problem: if they weren't there we wouldn't have this problem, take them off the banks' books, recapitalise the banks and keep the public finances obviously in a convincingly convergent way.

And remember that NAMA - people often say \"Oh, well, things got a lot worse and, you know, the problem was 2010 and 2011.\"   NAMA was paying the price at the November 2009 prices.  So NAMA wasn't saying, \"Oh I'm sorry now, I was going to pay this amount but the prices have just fallen in March and April and May\".  The prices continued to fall.  It's lucky they came back because otherwise NAMA would be heading for a big loss.  So those losses were embedded and when it became evident to the market ... and probably the timing of the way it became evident, in August and September of 2010, coming just to the cliff, nobody was going to roll their deposits.  Now why did we not clean up the banks, close down this one, Anglo was there as a running sore, why did we not close it down?  If we'd closed it down, as I mentioned before, the guarantee was there and all of the bondholders would say \"We noticed that you guaranteed all this stuff, and our bond isn't due until 2011 or 2014 or some date like that but our bond also contains an acceleration clause that says if a bank is closed down, then our bond falls due immediately.  So it's due immediately.  Government, you have guaranteed this, pay the money.\"  So, we couldn't do any of those drastic steps, which might have helped build confidence - though it's very hard to build confidence by closing a bank, as you see even nationalising Anglo in January 2009 had a ... the way it came out, had a very adverse effect on confidence, which was not expected; not expected at all, that nationalisation in January of 2009.

You're very welcome back, Governor Honohan.  Can I start by asking you about your official report, where you refer to the over-reliance in the financial stability reports from the Central Bank on the annual stress tests and even the stress tests in the summer of 2008 provided a reassuring picture.  How has the Central Bank addressed this over-reliance since?  And do you view the ECB stress tests as the appropriate mechanism for the Irish banking sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#X01600","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":799,"content":"<p>Yes.  So, an important distinction that I'd make is between the stress ... between stress tests, which start from the presumption that you will know what will happen in a base case and then you say \"What happens if things are much worse than we currently believe?\"  That exercise requires you to know how ... you say \"Well, does much worse mean?\"  You'd have to define an economic situation.  GDP will fall, inflation will rise, inflation will fall ... some scenario and then work out what will that mean for the bank's profit and loss.  But the much more important element and the element that wasn't included in the stress tests of the early 2000s was an \"as is\" assessment.  An \"as is\" assessment of the recoverable value of the loans, not just the accountants' value of the loans, which is based on accounting conventions but isn't really forward looking and this asset quality review dimension, which we started to bring in a very broad aggregative way in 2010 and then, when the BlackRock people were here, in a more detailed loan-by-loan basis.  That is what makes a difference and that is what is the linchpin of the ECB's approach and I think we contributed to that in discussions in the ECB during 2013 to their design of that, that they now have as a centrepiece the asset quality review with the stress test dimension being a sort of secondary.  Another reason the stress test is secondary is, you take one scenario, this will be a bad scenario and you might have time to take two scenarios, that scenario.   But you can't imagine all bad scenarios that could happen.  Some scenarios will be good for some banks and bad for others.  What if the scenario is, oil prices go up ... well, that might be good for some.  What if oil prices go down?  That is also bad for people.  So, yes, the short answer is yes, we have done a lot more and there are many other calculations that we can do in the background but it's okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#X01700","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":800,"content":"<p>On page 9 of your witness statement, you refer back to the issue of the guarantee and you make the point that its impact has been over-analysed and I think, for the first time, you put a figure on the potential costs of that decision as opposed to an alternative decision which might have involved trying to bail in the bondholders of Anglo and INBS, and you put a figure of somewhere between &euro;2 billion and &euro;10 billion, possibly.  Can you just elaborate on that because very often the guarantee decision is cited as the decision that cost &euro;64 billion?  You're making a fundamentally different point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#X01800","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":801,"content":"<p>Yes, and I thought the only way of focusing attention on this is to put a number.  Even though it's a wide range and there must be massive uncertainty about it because you hear witness after witness saying \"We could have done this but it would have cost a lot.\"  Well, hello, what was done cost a lot, so let's get quantitative about this and say how much more, is it actually plus or a minus?  And, you know, I'm sure lots of people could challenge those numbers.  Why did the numbers work out so low?  Partly because the scenario that I'm describing, this is a scenario where you actually knew the losses that were embedded in the banks and you decided to ... try to go for broke and you threaten the ... we don't threaten but you say \"Oh, we're really go to bail in everybody here.\"  While there are a lot of decision trees that happen after that, you have to see what are they going to say.  Well, they might say \"Don't do that\".  They will say \"Don't do that\".  But then they say \"Will you risk share with us?\"  Well, what will that lead to?  They'll say \"Oh, yes, don't worry, we'll look after you, we'll give you ELA, don't worry.\"  So, you're not quite sure what you will get.  You might in the end say \"Well, actually we won't bail them in.  That was just a bluff and we won't bail them in.\"  If you did bail in, I agree with the witnesses that have said that would be extremely costly in economic disruption and it might cost you &euro;20 billion, easily &euro;20 billion.  How would you get to &euro;20 billion?  Well, for example, if GDP fell by an additional 2% and then it stayed 2% lower for a couple of years and then gradually got back to the path, very quickly, you've got &euro;20 billion there.  So, it's quite ... you lose a lot of what you seem to save by not paying these people that you don't want to pay.  Also, some of the people ... let me say, oh, the bondholders - Irish credit unions, obviously, it's not going to be mostly, no.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#X01900","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":802,"content":"<p>Can I take you, Governor, to September 2010, when the future of Anglo Irish Bank was under serious consideration?

I think there were, perhaps, over 20 Members of the Oireachtas attended and we received a presentation from Alan Dukes, Mike Aynsley and Maarten van Eden, the chief financial officer, and they made a very strong picture at the time that really, Anglo should be split into a good bank and a bad bank and they highlighted, from their perspective, the risks of being over-dependent on a duopoly of AIB and Bank of Ireland and they stressed the need for a corporate bank to emerge from what remained of Anglo Irish Bank.

I remember when we were in Washington in early October for the IMF annual meetings, one of the topics was that resources of the IMF.  Do they have enough money to lend?  And the example explicitly was given, for example, for Ireland.  Oh, we didn't apply for anything so and then when Brian Lenihan and myself and other colleagues met the IMF country team, we discussed in quite a lot of detail what would a programme look like.  So Brian Lenihan was very interested in this.  So it's completely hypothetical and then I remember meeting with the secretary, the deputy secretary or Under Secretary of the US Treasury because, again with Brian Lenihan, Dr. Brainard and she ... we were explicitly talking in hypothetical terms.  I think Brian Lenihan started talking about a programme and if I'm remembering rightly now I said, \"Of course, this is entirely hypothetical.\"  But this is early October so it was very, very much in the air and Brian Lenihan's view was I think that he needed time to prepare the ground for a major fiscal adjustment, which would be part of the programme, and he couldn't be rushing into a programme if he didn't have that time.

He said, \"In many ways [the] letter was entirely superfluous, since it was already clear by the time of the letter that the Government was going to opt into a programme.\"  Now, that would imply, in the same way that somebody would apply for a mortgage, you might be many months negotiating with the bank and then you sign off on the mortgage eventually.  But speaking on the same related matter, Jean-Claude Trichet, when he appeared at the IEA-hosted event in Kilmainham on 30 April 2015, speaking in around the same issue, said as \"you know, we could also have continued on our side after having gone up to 100% of ... GDP ... to 200% of ... GDP, and why not 300% of ... GDP?\".  This relates to the ELA exposure, and we'll have the ... more exact sum hopefully later this afternoon.  He then went on to say, \"Then what would the [commission of inquiry been] asking for\", referring to this inquiry, as to what our terms of reference would be.  He goes on to say, \"You would say, 'were you totally crazy at the ECB to continue, when we were going into the wall at 100 mph, to continue to provide liquidity and liquidity, and liquidity?'.\"  So, Governor Honohan, can I ask you, was Mr. Trichet right in this regard if this action hadn't happened and the entry into the programme had been delayed, would the cost of the bailout have even been bigger for Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#FF02100","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>Well ... I'd like to say two things about that.  First of all, I think he was not correct in saying that the ELA was going to grow up out of all, all proportion.<\/p><p>In fact, by that stage, I was presenting projections of ELA which proved to be - and the total access of the banks ... of the Central Bank proved to be reasonably accurate, as these things go.

So they had no perception.<\/p><p> Now, if the access to the programme had been deferred, what would the consequence have been?  Well, I'd like to put it this way, I think the need for a programme could've been avoided if the ECB had decided - which I think they would consider themselves not wanting to do - if they had decided to say, \"It doesn't matter, we will fund the Irish banks.  Don't you worry about the Irish banks, we trust the Irish State\", then the programme might not have been necessary because the markets might've said, \"Well, that's all right then.  The banks are going to be okay, so there won't be any run on the banks\", and the markets are saying, \"Yes, we'll lend to the Irish Government; it's going to cost them though.  It's going to cost them 7%, 8%, 9%.\"  So the Irish Government could probably have staggered on and staggered through the crises of 2011 and 2012, when the rates of interest would've been ever higher and higher and now we would be saddled with much higher debt servicing costs.  So, actually, although the ECB, in a way, by saying ... by refusing to give an open-ended guarantee that the banks would be funded, it actually, inadvertently, did us a favour by allowing the State to go right through those difficult euro crisis years of 2011 and 2012 with the protection of official funding at low interest rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#FF02200","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1027,"content":"<p>And the funding you're talking about now ... just to clarify, is that funding specific to the banks or funding specific-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#GG00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>Funding for the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>So that's the Exchequer deficit being-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#GG00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#GG00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1031,"content":"<p>-----being met as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#GG00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1032,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#GG00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>So, by turn, if a programme had been entered earlier than November 2010, would the cost ... or was there an opportunity for the cost to be potentially less?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#GG00800","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I don't think so because if you recall, towards the end of September 2010, the NTMA announced ... or the Minister announced, that the NTMA had enough cash for several months so it stopped borrowing.

So he was very cross.  You know, &quot;Why are they trying to rush me?  What's this?&quot;  So he was very cross.  There was no talking to him.  So I went back into the meeting, my tail between my legs, and I wondered what was going to happen next.  And I started to worry that I wasn't doing enough, that there was a sense of panic - both in the official circles but especially in the market, and they had these outflows - and I thought, &quot;I should be doing something.&quot;  And I ... somebody sent me a copy of the <i>Financial Times<\/i>' leader article, which was saying Ireland should be preparing for a bank run, and I'm sitting down here doing nothing?  And the leader in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>says Ireland should be preparing for a bank run when I should be doing something, if I should be preparing for a bank run.  So I thought maybe ... maybe if I could say on the radio, &quot;Look, we have loads of money, central banks, we can provide money to these banks, you don't need to be taking your money out, your money is perfectly safe.&quot;  So I took the opportunity in ... not in a meeting but just in a corridor, to ask the relevant senior people, &quot;Will you contradict me if I say the ECB will ... &quot;Don't worry, ECB will give unlimited money.&quot;  Because then I would be armed with a statement that I could make.<br\/><br\/>Now, let me backtrack that a week before, actually more like two weeks before, when there were ... outflows were starting to build up, one evening - among many conversations - one evening Brian Lenihan phoned me, I was just outside the Luas on Stephen's Green and he said, &quot;Look, we're hearing from this part of the country and that part of the country that there are outflows.  You should make a statement.&quot;  And I said, &quot;Well, I don't think that's a good idea, because I've no ... I can't just say, &quot;Don't worry, everything will be all right&quot;, I have to have some story, I have to have some explanation, justification for this.&quot;  He said, &quot;Well, look, I'll leave it to you, I bow to your ...&quot;.  So what did the ECB people say?  They said, &quot;We will contradict you, because we cannot give an open-ended guarantee.&quot;  So I spent the night thinking about what I should do and I decided that, first of all, that time was of the essence, market movements very, very ... you know, once you lose the confidence of the markets it can take a long time to get it back.  So I thought, &quot;Now, you must act now.&quot;  And I thought I'd probably be able to convince people that the Central Bank is going to provide their money, even if I don't give a promise that the ECB ... and I think if you look at the wording of the statement ... of the interview that I gave on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; you'll see I went very, very close to saying that the ECB would provide all the finances that would be necessary.  And then I pulled back, saying, &quot;Of course I would have to ask them, but I don't think they'll say 'No'.&quot;  And I got away with it.  They didn't contradict me.  So that was my whole thinking.<br\/><br\/>Now, was I trying to contradict the Taoiseach?  Was I trying to contradict other Ministers who'd said that?  No, I wasn't trying to do that.  Maybe I wasn't sufficiently attuned to the political happenings that were going on in Dublin because I'd been in Brussels and Frankfurt and, you know, doing all these discussions.  When the Taoiseach said ... of the time said, &quot;We're not in negotiations,&quot; I took that to be the standard thing ... understood, by informed people, to say, &quot;Oh you're not in negotiations, you're in pre-negotiations&quot;, and that it was one of these kind, &quot;Oh, you know, we'll go into the little room, we'll have this round table, and we'll have this square table,&quot; that's that what he was ... he wasn't ... so when I said well, we're not ... I didn't say we were in negotiations, we were in discussions, &quot;I hope that, I hope it will be successful, I will suggest that we go into a ...&quot;.  So I thought I was safe enough on the political arena.  I knew they wouldn't be all that happy that I made the announcement but I didn't realise they'd be so unhappy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#HH02300","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1094,"content":"<p>Can I just clarify one thing, Mr. Honohan?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#HH02400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#HH02500","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>Did you instigate the call or did RTE contact you?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#HH02600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>No, I contacted them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#HH02700","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#HH02800","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>I contacted them, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#HH02900","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#HH03000","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>Did you tell either Brian Cowen or Brian Lenihan that you were going to make the call?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#HH03100","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>No, I didn't, I didn't.

So start with the November 2010.  When I got back from Frankfurt on Thursday, 18 November, I participated in the first of these meetings, a high-level meeting, it was quite amusing because we talked about more or less procedural things.  We were picking up from what we had discussed in Brussels.  It was in Kevin Cardiff's room in the Department of Finance and there must have been about 12 or 15 people there, so it was principals, it was just, the senior people.  And after an hour or two we broke, and maybe it was 8 o'clock, and we broke for sandwiches, and during the sandwiches, the IMF representative said, \"Of course this is not part of our discussions but what about the bondholders?  I mean, there are unguaranteed bondholders, how many of them are there?  And just hypothetically, what would happen if there was some mechanism for imposing haircuts on them?\"  Well, this was the first we'd heard of anything like this, even after two days of meetings in Brussels.<\/p><p>And obviously, it was a strange attempt by the IMF to bring back on to the table something which presumably they must have ... had been brushed aside in their pre-meetings with the rest of the troika.  So, this was our first idea that one of the institutions, at least, would support some mechanism for burden-sharing with senior bondholders at the banks.  We were very excited by this ... on the ... there is a unanimous view on the Irish side that this was a great opportunity.  Why?  Because now we were in a period of three years, prospectively, protected by official financing so that any disturbances in the markets could be contained and also the reputation risk of burning bondholders would be greatly diminished if it was at the behest of the IMF, who know about these things.  So immediately, this was a great plus.  So, there followed in subsequent days, it was clear that the others didn't want this discussion to go greyface and they were uneasy and they said, \"I think we should get back to the meeting proper now\", and stuff like that.  So, there were further discussions, not all of which I was involved in, over the coming ... the next few days.  So that's that episode.  Were the ECB involved in this?

Now, I just want to ask you in relation to where the next crisis might come from, which is a question you kind of posed there.  Is it disturbing or not to see in the Irish funds industry promotional material the following, &quot;Through its work with governmental and industry committees and working groups, [Irish funds] contributes to and influences the development of Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory and legislative framework.&quot;  That's one quote and the second one is:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Irish regulated funds are exempt from Irish tax on income and gains derived from their investments and are not subject to any Irish tax on their net asset value. There are additionally no net asset, transfer or capital taxes on the issue, transfer or redemption of units owned by non-Irish resident investors. ... Non-Irish investors are not subject to Irish tax on their investment and do not incur any withholding taxes on payments from the fund.<\/blockquote>A question that arises for me, which I would like to pose to you, Governor, is the finance industry, perhaps, one crisis ahead of the State and the regulatory system?  And let me just put it in this context: that in the 2000s, we had evidence here in the 2000s during the bubble, the regulator was assiduously regulating for issues that had taken place in the previous ten years, consumer issues, etc.  You have been busy putting in place regulation to try and prevent what happened during the bubble.  But here, we have remarkable language and a promotion not unlike what we heard in relation to property tax breaks, etc.  So, is it possible that another crisis is developing here, that the Irish State or regulatory system is not on top of?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#KK01700","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1167,"content":"<p>Okay.  No, I think it's a very important question.<\/p><p>First of all, some things have definitely improved.  The Central Bank does keep a watching eye on the work of the clearing house group but it does not participate in its discussions and we no longer have any responsibility, statutory responsibility for developing the financial sector, which was a goal.  We also don't any longer have ... there was an industry panel, a panel of industry specialists, which had certain powers under the previous legislation to poke around in what the Central Bank was doing for as far as regulation was concerned and lobby in that.  We don't have that; that was ruled out of the new legislation.  The tax matters have nothing to do with the Central Bank.  Now, certainly these non-bank areas are ... Ireland is one of the largest centres in Europe for funds.  It is also a substantial centre for insurance.  We have increased our efforts to supervise the ... Funds is supposed to be simple, but then, mortgage lending was also supposed to be simple.  Simple because these funds, the investors are supposed to be sophisticated wholesale entities and there is no risk of them to the payment system or to the general run of things.  So, in principle, funds could collapse and the Government wouldn't be entailed.<\/p><p> However, we have to make sure the funds are doing what they say they are doing and that they are set up in accordance with the various pieces of legislation, mainly European legislation on the funds, and we do have a supervisory effort there.  It seems to me that the regulation there has become very, very complex, very demanding and we will be increasing our staffing again on that side.<\/p><p> On insurance, we have already identified a sector of insurance which had grown here in the 2000s, a sector which was ... or a product, a range of products under the general heading of variable annuities, which were very complex and rather risky products.  We noticed that Ireland was becoming one of the centres for this and we didn't like that because it sounded as if there might be some reasons ... we wanted to make sure that we were regulating it adequately and we weren't just getting these businesses coming here because they were getting some, kind of, lighter run on it.  So we scrutinised that very closely, we discovered the risks that are involved and we have imposed much higher capital requirements on the firms that were providing these products and we're satisfied that this is safe.  I'll give you just an example from the numbers that I had there.  In 2009, insurance supervision, we had 42 people and, in the house at present, we have 96.8 people on insurance.  So we are not just regulating ... not just concentrating on the last war, we are looking to the next war and insurance and funds.  Funds figures are more complicated because they are mixed up with some other stuff.

I just want to deal with one other matter, and if I can get a particular document up on screen there.  Professor, this is a letter to yourself of 25 October 2012.  The letter is from Minister Noonan and it relates to the Minister for Finance writing to you requesting that you present the Government proposal to the economic management council, EMC, of 8 November 2012, covering the liquidation of IBRC and the replacement of the promissory notes with long-dated Government bonds.<\/p> <p>  And if I can go to the second page of that, because the second page is where the ask actually is, and it's the very last paragraph there with bullet points.  It says, \"The ECB agree, as a minimum, to a long-term [this is what they're asking you to go to Europe and talk to the ECB about] weighted average life for Government and Government guaranteed marketable bonds, in line with the proposal.\"  The other ask that they ask you to take to the ECB is, \"The ECB agree that the Central Bank of Ireland will affirm to the market that it will hold these bonds to maturity in order to ensure the financial stability of Ireland.\"  And the third ask they're asking you to take to the ECB is that, \"The MFI status is retained for IBRC, for technical reasons, post liquidation, until the assets are sold.\"  It concludes, \"Absent agreement on these key issues the proposal will not proceed.\"  So these are the key requirements to set up the liquidation of IBRC.  Could you outline to the committee this afternoon, the reception this proposal was ... how the ECB received this proposal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#NN01000","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435186800,"counter":1211,"content":"<p>So, bullet points 1 and 3 were fully agreed by the ECB, and so the average life of Government bonds that were used in this transaction was 34.5 years.  My idea was 40 years and it was whittled away to 34.5, which I thought was long enough.  The second point was challenged by ... on legal grounds, by ECB staff, who felt that a commitment to hold the bonds to maturity would create serious concerns about possible inconsistency with Article 123 of the treaty.  Our lawyers in both the Central Bank and independent lawyers, were engaged by, I believe the ... well, either Central Bank or by the Government, I can't remember, felt that this argument was wrong and that we could hold them to maturity.  But, the ECB held out very firmly and said there had to be a prospect of disposing of these bonds so that they would not be held to maturity.<\/p> <p>  And, over the following months, there were detailed discussions and negotiations, and in the end a form of wording was agreed where ... which was acceptable to the Government, despite the statement in the letter, which said that they would be disposed  ... the bonds would be disposed of as quickly as possible, subject to financial stability conditions.<\/p> <p>  So, you can see the financial stability argument is there, and then, in addition, there was a schedule which was a minimum schedule, and that minimum schedule was back-loaded, but it was going to ensure that the bonds were disposed of well before maturity, thereby disposing of the bulk of the legal concerns.<\/p> <p>  So, I would say we ... those three principles were there and we had to ... Irish side had to concede, to some extent, on the second one.  Turned out, however, because of the financial structure of the bonds, floating rate notes and so forth, that the great fall in interest rates and in the spread of the Irish Government against German bonds, that this second condition no longer was vital for the concerns of the Department of Finance and the fiscal concerns of the Government, that actually, disposing of the bonds into stable financial conditions at these lower spreads gave you as much advantage as hanging onto them, in terms of the profit flow of the Central Bank.  So, actually everything has worked out.  The design was fail-safe and it has worked quite advantageously.  So the Central Bank has since then been disposing of these bonds and continues to do so.  The financial stability conditions allow that and it's disposing of them more rapidly than envisioned and will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015062500002#NN01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Patrick Honohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1435186800,"counter":1212,"content":"<p>Thank you.

It was poorly informed in regard to the motivation of the players, the key players, and the behaviour of the key players.  And I think it very badly misrepresents both the opportunities and the strategies of the Irish side, suggesting that there was some missed opportunity.  There are all sorts of funny things about the piece.  It doesn't really hang together.  Now, it was a contrarian view, yes, but it was a contrarian view, in this case, after the event.  Now, sometimes he was ... he was very much, you know, be careful, because this is happening.  I mean, he made lots of important contributions on a number of issues, of course, the property lending, and the residential mortgages, that was, sort of obvious, but he ... that ... he was wrong on this, he was wrong also, as we know now, on the stress tests of 2014 on what was going to be used to damage the Irish business sector.  And he also tries to present the Central Bank, or me, as being a great advocate of paying banks before everybody else, which I think is very, very unfair.  I didn't do the guarantee.  I tried to get as ... claw back as much as possible.<\/p><p> There was a crunch time for a decision on these issues in September 2010, when we were coming to the cliff.  And that's why I included in my statement that footnote elaborately setting out what I thought about at the time, which was six months or eight months before he produced that article.  So it wasn't as if we were just sitting there saying \"Ah sure, everything's all right, oh, suddenly we're in a programme\", no, we seriously considered this and we decided it was not safe to do something like this and that if there had to be a restructuring, it should be in a different environment later.  And probably I did have, as I mentioned before, an idea that, you know, what ... the best way to restructure if it should become necessary, which it hadn't.  And then he advocated, he explicitly advocated in the article, cutting public expenditure at a stroke.  Well, that's like adding a super-charged austerity, an extra &euro;30 billion or something of super-charged austerity ... like, why?  Why did he want that?  It doesn't make any sense.  If he's going to be a defaultist, which in a way he was and in a way he wasn't, he was saying \"Bankruptcy is disastrous\", but he did want us to default on the guaranteed bonds; so it's hard to say whether he wanted it or not, well, you would not default before you had run the course of borrowing as much as was going, so ... and Brian Lenihan had no game plan for holding out for six months.  And if he had, which he didn't, he could still have held out for six months, it was nothing to do with me.<\/p><p> And there was lots of stuff.  He said that ... I had a look at it recently, so, because I knew, I think you mentioned it earlier on, and he said \"This all comes down to arithmetic.\"  Okay, that's true, I am very much in favour of that.  He said, \"In 2014 the debt of the Irish State will be &euro;250 billion.\"  Well, actually it was &euro;203 billion and that's a difference.  So, look, I have a lot of respect and a lot of time for Morgan Kelly.

They are important because they are a serious and preventable cause of congenital malformations.  About one in 1,000 pregnancies is complicated by neural tube defect.  To put that in context, 80 families every year are touched by the crisis of having a pregnancy with a neural tube defect.  <\/p> <p>  This group of congenital abnormalities includes anencephaly which, as the members may be aware, is incompatible with life.  Death before birth is common and survival beyond the first week of life rare.  Spina bifida and encephalocoele both have a high peri-natal and infant mortality.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, about 80% of infants with spina bifida survive, although the condition is associated with varying degrees of disability.  The number of babies live-born with spina bifida in Ireland is higher than in any country with the exception of Malta.  That is, in part, because of our legislation on termination of pregnancy.  In my view, this means we have a greater responsibility to prevent neural tube defects than many other EU countries do.<\/p> <p>  NTDs carry a heavy, life-long burden of illness for the individual, parents and families and, incidentally, there is a heavy financial burden for the health services.<\/p><p>Some neural tube defects are genetic in origin but two landmark studies from the 1990s indicate that approximately two thirds are preventable by increasing the mother's consumption of folic acid before and during the early days of pregnancy.  There are three possible sources of folate.  The first is food, and I have listed in my submission the various foodstuffs.  I will not go through them in detail.  The bio-availability of folate from food is limited and it is strongly influenced by methods of preparation.  For example, boiling degrades the natural form of vitamin but steaming does not.  During pregnancy, the demands for folate increase as it is important for the development of the baby.  Even if a woman is on a healthy diet and where food is prepared appropriately, it is very difficult for any woman to achieve the necessary amounts of folate through dietary means alone.<br\/><br\/>The second source of folate is folic acid supplements.  Based on scientific evidence over the past 24 years, it is recommended that the optimum dose of supplemental folic acid for the prevention of neural tube defects is 400 micrograms orally per day, which is readily available from pharmacists over the counter.  However, with individual women where there is increased risk of neural tube defects, a higher dose of 5 mg orally per day should be taken, and this requires a prescription before it is dispensed.  In particular, this applies to women with a history of neural tube defects, women who are obese or with type 2 diabetes mellitus or women on particular medication, such as certain anti-epileptic drugs.<br\/><br\/>The third source of folate is food fortification, which may be mandatory or voluntary.  In North America, food fortification with folic acid is mandatory and this has been associated with a decrease in the incidence of neural tube defects in the United States, Canada and other countries such as South Africa and Chile.  In Ireland and the rest of the European Union - with the exception of Sweden - food fortification with folic acid is voluntary.  There was a recommendation that went to the Government in 2006 about mandatory food fortification but following a report from the Food Safety Authority in 2008, the Government decided not to mandate fortification.<br\/><br\/>I will now move to some recent research published in Ireland that is relevant to much of the discussion.  Ireland had a high incidence of neural tube defects compared with the rest of Europe and the rate had been falling.  However, a recent comprehensive national study was undertaken by my colleagues in the HSE EUROCAT, and I acknowledge the work of Dr. Bob McDonnell and Dr. Virginia Delany in carrying out this detailed national study.  It indicates that the incidence of neural tube defects in Ireland had increased significantly from the previous audit in 2005 and 2006; this increase was from 0.92 per thousand births to 1.17 per thousand births in 2009 to 2011.  Of the 236 cases over three years, approximately half were due to spina bifida and another half were due to anencephaly.  Importantly, of the 94 babies born with spina bifida, 90% survived the neonatal period and the overwhelming majority ended up having spinal surgery in the national centre in Temple Street.  Interestingly, the incidence of neural tube defects was higher outside Dublin, and that was significant.  The increase in the incidence may be explained by better case ascertainment in the recent study but we believe that is not the case and the incidence has now stopped falling.<br\/><br\/>With regard to food fortification, an important study was carried out by Dr. Mary Rose Sweeney and her team in Dublin City University, where they audited fortified foods available in supermarkets in the Republic of Ireland.  They visited six of the top supermarkets by market share in Dublin and compared folic acid levels with nutrition levels from two previous studies in 2004 and 2008.  They found that the voluntary fortification of food has been reduced in Ireland and this decision has been taken by food manufacturers.<br\/><br\/>A third piece of research was carried out by my colleague, Dr. McKeating, who studied women booking antenatal care in the Coombe.  She found that the number of women taking periconceptual folic acid had fallen from 45% in 2009 to 43% in 2013.  This fall is statistically significant and at a time one would hope the number of women taking periconceptual folic acid would increase, it is coming down.  This decrease was more likely to occur in women who had children before, who were older, who were obese and who were born in Ireland.  Some women in our society are more vulnerable than others when it comes to not taking periconceptual folic acid.<br\/><br\/>A recent study published from the UCD centre of a large series of women in the Coombe indicates that only one in four women takes folic acid for more than 12 weeks before pregnancy, as is recommended.  Looking at it another way, three of four women booking antenatal care have inadequate folic acid supplementation at the start of pregnancy.  Women who planned their pregnancy or who were having their first baby were more likely to take folic acid.  We have just reviewed all the guidelines on folic acid in the European Union that are produced by national bodies.  There is inconsistency across national and international guidance about folic acid supplementation, and this must be confusing for the general population and women of child-bearing age in particular.<br\/><br\/>Based on our research to date, we have recently received a large grant from <i>safe<\/i>food, an all-island body, and we are planning to look at what exactly are the red cell folate levels in women at the start of pregnancy in Dublin, Cork and Belfast.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is currently reviewing the issue of food fortification and there is a report due to go to the Minister, so I do not wish to pre-empt that report.<br\/><br\/>Where does this leave us?  We need to update and revise the national guidance that we give to women of childbearing age.  In the past we have often told women that if they plan to become pregnant, they should take folic acid.  The problem is that a third of pregnancies in the country are unplanned and those figures are similar to other countries.  With the two thirds of pregnancies that are planned, in half of those the women conceives within three months of planning the pregnancy, and therefore there is not enough folic acid on board by the time she conceives.  We also need to get across a message to women who are at increased risk that they need to take high doses of folic acid, with a prescription required from a doctor.<br\/><br\/>It is a long time since there was a public health campaign on the subject of periconceptual folic acid.  We need to relaunch such a scheme and prioritise those women who are particularly vulnerable.  As part of any public health campaign, health care professionals nationally and internationally need to be consistent in their communication and highlight the importance of pre-pregnancy supplementation in addition to that in early pregnancy.<\/p><p>Health care professionals nationally and internationally need to be consistent in their communications and to highlight the importance of pre-pregnancy supplementation as well as that in early pregnancy.<\/p><p> We find from recent studies carried out in the Coombe that women of childbearing age use smart phones extensively to access pregnancy-related information.  We suggest that future campaigns should use social media as well as traditional communication tools.<\/p><p> The issue of mandatory food fortification with FA needs to be reviewed urgently by the Government and this has implications not only for the Department of Health but also for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As food and food ingredients are now sourced globally this issue would benefit, in my view, from a pan-European approach to the regulation and subsequent monitoring of all food fortification.  In the meantime, I recommend that there is an improvement in communications about voluntary FA fortification between the food industry and women and health care professionals.  The food manufacturers reduced the amount of fortification in food but they failed to communicate that message to women of childbearing age and failed to communicate it to health care professionals.  This reduction in voluntary FA fortification and in supplementation may explain in part why we have seen an increase in the incidence of neural-tube defects nationally in recent years.

I am interested in the point that in America there is food fortification but that although the neural-tube defects incidence has reduced that reduction is less than had been hoped.  Reference has been made to collating statistics.  Professor Turner says there is a higher incidence in Ireland than in Malta, probably because of our abortion legislation.  How are statistics on neural-tube defects, and the impact of food fortification on their reduction, collated, given the varying levels of termination around the world and transnational movement of people?<\/p> <p>  On the broader issue of food fortification, does this cover all food types or are there specific types of food that are more beneficial to women for periconceptual FA intake?  There is now an obesity problem in this country.  Demographics show that in ten years&rsquo; time many women of childbearing age will be obese.  How does Professor Turner suggest we plan for that?  While the Food Safety Authority is carrying out a review on food fortification is it wise for any country to put the health of the nation into the hands of food manufacturers without there being some form of regulatory oversight?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#E00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1671,"content":"<p>I was trying to find out what was the first paper from Ireland on the issue of FA and neural tube defects because a lot of research was done on this here by Professor Weir and Dr. Scott.  Ireland has contributed significantly to this area.  I am delighted to see such high quality publications from Professor Turner and others in this area.<\/p> <p>  I thank Professor Turner.  This is very important.  Much time is wasted within the walls of these buildings but there is a real chance that something could come out of today&rsquo;s meeting that could make a difference.  Professor Turner refers to people having surgery for neural-tube defects and while I am rusty on paediatrics my clear recollection is that the surgery for patients with neural tube defects does not correct the underlying neurological deficit.  If somebody is born with severe spina bifida to the extent of having neurological compromise or paralysis the surgery does not fix that, it closes the defect in the skin and back.  There is no treatment for a neural tube defect.  What you see is what you get.  <\/p> <p>  What is the cost of FA supplementation?  Whenever we attempt anything in public health which can be construed as mass medication there will be a fringe of objectors who will raise concerns about potential side effects and health consequences of the intervention because we are medicating many people who do not need the intervention to bring a great benefit to a small number of people.  Is there any credible evidence that there are any side effects from mass medication with folic supplements, either medicinally or through food supplementation?  Do we know what was the chain of events whereby the food industry decided to reduce the folic content?  Was it just a cost issue?  Did it find it cheaper not to do it or were there other considerations?  This may not be something Professor Turner has first-hand experience of but I would welcome his speculation on it. <\/p> <p>  Some of the issues Professor Turner has mentioned about the epidemiology of the decline in the uptake of FA among women presenting for antenatal care had a little ring of being a surrogate for socio-educational status and I presume that is a major factor.  In so many issues in public health, be it obesity or cigarette smoking, we find that the burden of preventable illness is falling on the people who can least afford it.  I would be grateful for Professor Turner&rsquo;s insights into that.<\/p> <p>  What would be Professor Turner&rsquo;s best guess if we had a folate tsar?  I dread to say it because I am sure the Health Service Executive, HSE, will think of appointing one.  If we had full compliance with best practice, knowing what we can achieve with maximum folate supplementation, what does Professor Turner think would be the impact of that nirvana-like implementation of health policy on the reduction in the number of cases of neural tube defects?<\/p> <p>  I thank Professor Turner and encourage him to keep up the good work clinically and in the research arena.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#E00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1672,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Turner for his comprehensive presentation.

He said that the decrease over five years was more likely to occur in women who had children before, who were aged between 30 and 39 years, who were obese and who had been born in Ireland.  I know we have an obesity problem but is there an increasing number of obese pregnant women?  Does that arise more now than it did five or ten years ago?

Would all the maternity units across the country and-or the GPs be involved in the rolling out of the campaign?  The reason I am raising the issue of the involvement of the GPs, is that a person speaking at a recent GP meeting on obesity raised the issue of doctors discussing child obesity with the parents.  They responded by saying \"No\".  One GP gave the example of raising it and then the entire family moved from the practice.  <\/p><p> How does one get a message across in a very diplomatic way?

One might have a baby diagnosed with spina bifida in one hospital being transferred to be delivered in a second hospital and the surgery being carried out in a third hospital.  There are a series of sets of data.  One of the challenges - this is why this study by Dr. Bob McDonnell and Ms Virginia Delaney was so important - is that they drilled into the detail of individual cases to ensure there was no double counting.  Many of the data sets in the past were confined to babies beyond 24 weeks gestation but we have had to drill down and try to get some of the data to which Deputy Kelleher referred.<font color=\"#545454\">  <\/font>Much of the international data is regionally based.

The recent study is also very enlightening because when one looks at the big six supermarkets in terms of market share, two of the six have entered the market in the past ten years.  One of the big German conglomerates fortifies its food.  The other does not.  They now have 16% of the market share.  They have foodstuffs that are very price sensitive and are likely to be availed of by those who are socially disadvantaged.  The public is not aware of these facts.  It is not aware that a certain food was fortified in the past but is not being fortified now.  That is unfair on women who are of child bearing age.  The women will often look at the labels and see that it is fortified but when they buy the same food six months later they will not look at the label again to see whether the company has continued to fortify the food.  There is a responsibility on the food manufacturers to notify the public in the first instance and the health care professionals and policy makers, who should be aware of such changes, if they propose to make changes in the voluntary fortification of foods.<\/p> <p>  In terms of specific food categories, it is different when it comes to mandatory food fortification.  In general, governments world wide have generally focused on flour.  That is what has been done in North America, on the basis that most people eat bread.  Again we need to be conscious of the fact that people's food habits are evolving over time and for example a lot of women have changed to eating snack bars on the way to work or for lunch and are not eating bread to the same extent as in the past.  With mandatory fortification programme, one cannot assume that food eating practices are constant and that they are the same for women of child bearing age compared to women or men in other circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I will address Deputy Kelleher's question on obesity levels.  Again Dr. McKeating has recently published a paper in the Scandinavian journal which shows that one in six women booking for antenatal care in the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital is now obese.  The patients attending the Coombe number one in eight of everybody born in the Republic of Ireland, so it is a representative sample.  Dr. McKeating's research indicates that the obesity levels in the country are stable.  What is worrying is that she also was able to demonstrate that 2% of the population are morbidly obese and have a body mass index of greater than 40.  In absolute numbers it has gone up 50% in five years.  This is very challenging at several levels and has results in a major increase in the number of women with gestational diabetes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael Turner"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1678,"content":"<p>Is there any particular reason for the five year period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#F00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435221000,"counter":1679,"content":"<p>Up until 2009, the women had not been weighed at their first visit.  We reintroduced weighing in 2009.  There is a lot of good data internationally on obesity levels outside of pregnancy but there is a paucity of information about obesity during pregnancy itself.  This has implications not just for folic acid.  We know that obese women are more likely to have congenital malformations.  We know they are more likely to have babies with neural tube defects.  We also know that, technically, because of their obesity it is harder to make the diagnosis of neural tube defects because when one comes to do the scan, the baby is further away from the probe.  The obesity crisis is another issue that merits attention.<\/p> <p>  I will now deal with the cost of supplementation.  The costs of fortification for the food industry in extremely low, I read a figure of the order of 19 cent per individual per annum.  It is a pittance.  One can buy folic acid supplements over the counter.  The cost varies from pharmacy to pharmacy and one can get better deals from some pharmacists compared to others.<\/p><p>Again, this is in the order of &euro;4 or &euro;5 per month.  My concern about the decrease is that it is a discretionary spend and the demographic of women in their 20s and 30s who should be spending money on supplementation are also those who are struggling to make ends meet with their mortgages and trying to feed their families.  They prioritise the nutrition of the children they already have without planning for the children they might have in future.  This may explain the regional differences with regard to Dublin.  We do not know precisely why there are differences between Dublin and the rest of Ireland, but we know from the Central Statistics Office that people in Dublin spend 20% more on food than people outside Dublin.  This highlights the importance of doing national audits.  In the past, many of the audits on neural tube defects were Dublin-centric because of the excellent data collection in the three Dublin maternity hospitals.  We need to audit outcomes throughout the country and not just in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>Senator Crown asked about the side effects.  There are concerns, and he would probably know more about it than I do, about whether excessive folic acid may be associated with cancer, particularly bowel cancer.  I do not find the evidence particularly compelling in terms of risk.  It is weak.  There is also evidence that cancer is associated with folic depletion.  Folic acid may have benefits other than preventing neural tube defects.  The evidence suggests that it also prevents cardiac congenital abnormalities and cleft lip and palate abnormalities.  It may prevent cardiac disease and stroke in adults.  Having lots of folic acid in one's diet and taking folic acid supplements has benefits which go beyond preventing neural tube defects.<br\/><br\/>All pregnancy outcomes have a social gradient, and this is very important.  It is those women who need folic acid supplementation the most who do not avail of it.  When it comes to the planning of pregnancy, there is a very strong social gradient.  This is important not just in terms of folic acid supplementation but with regard to preparation for pregnancy generally, including losing weight, increasing physical exercise and stopping smoking.<br\/><br\/>If we had complete compliance with folic acid supplementation - in other words, if every woman took it for three months before she became pregnant - it is estimated that two thirds of cases of neural tube defects would be prevented.  To put this in context, approximately 50 to 60 families every year have a baby who must come to Temple Street for surgery, which corrects the defect rather than the neurological issue, so 40 families would be spared this trauma.  There is no good data as to the cost to the health services of neural tube defects in Ireland, other than to say that a big review was published four years ago which estimated that each case of spina bifida costs &euro;500,000 over the lifetime of the person concerned.  If one takes this &euro;500,000 and multiplies it by 60, it is &euro;30 million.  We could do a lot with &euro;30 million in maternity services.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the consistency of our guidelines, we need to get our house in order nationally.  Some guidelines say that folic acid should be taken when one is planning pregnancy, while others say it should be taken one month beforehand and others say three months beforehand.  In general, most European guidelines were published after the landmark studies of the 1990s, but the more recent research suggests that folic acid should be taken for three months beforehand.  The European guidelines need to be updated.  The Canadians and Australians have updated their guidelines and they are advanced.  If we get our house in order there is something that could be done at EU level in terms of aligning guidelines, particularly now with women in their 20s and 30s moving more freely between EU countries.  We need to have consistency.<br\/><br\/>The demographic in question uses social media a lot.  This has advantages because we know from our work in the Coombe that 95% of pregnant women use their smartphones for pregnancy-related information.  Interestingly, those who are socially disadvantaged also use it a lot.  It has advantages in that it is inexpensive.  We can measure its use, we can archive it, we can update it very quickly and we know what parts of it are used.  We cannot do this with traditional communication channels.  Not just on the issue of folic acid, but on the issue of providing information to women who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy, we need to have a national e-health strategy when it comes to maternity services.  I am pleased to report that I was at a meeting recently at which I learned that <i>safe<\/i>food is planning to launch a social media campaign in July on folic acid supplementation.<br\/><br\/>Senator Burke asked about childhood obesity and whether it was an issue.  If a mother or father is obese the child is three to four times more likely to be obese.  This is why, when we speak about maternal obesity, we see it not just in terms of the mother; it is a family issue.  If mothers have a healthy lifestyle and diet, we hope the fathers will improve.  We know that one in six fathers-to-be in the Coombe are also obese.  We hope that if the parents have a healthy diet the children will have a healthy diet.  There is concern about obesity begetting obesity.  Nationally we need a strategy on breaking the intergenerational cycle of obesity.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Deputy Byrne on the regional differences.  Transition year is a great opportunity across the board to educate girls and boys on what they should do to modify their risks subsequently in life.  There are huge educational opportunities that we are not taking as a country at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael Turner","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1681,"content":"<p>To go back to a few issues, the people who most require public health messages are those least likely to hear them.

It should be part of the routine GP care that young children should be assessed because one of the problems is that parents sometimes do not recognise obesity in their own children.  Sometimes they can be very sensitive.  When we came to measure the fathers, there were two fathers who would not step on the weighing scale and it was obvious to everybody that they were both morbidly obese.  There is a sense of denial when it comes to the obesity issue.  As part of the new under six contract, children should be assessed for obesity at certain milestones, because early intervention in childhood is far more productive than waiting until their teenage years.  Again, it is linked to dietary policies and physical activity and sports, so it touches on that in terms of national policy.  If every GP had to do the same measurements as part of their GP care, people would not move from one general practitioner to another because they did not like what the first GP had to say.

They do this on an ongoing, routine basis - it is regular surveillance.  Some of these registries are regional registries within countries and some are national registries.  For example, in Scandinavia there are national registries in Norway, Sweden and Finland which monitor, on a yearly basis, the numbers of all congenital birth defects.<\/p> <p>  The European network, of which there are three Irish HSE member registries, is called EUROCAT.  The registries monitor all birth defects, including live and still births, and the terminations within Europe.  The Irish registries measure the live and still births.  The termination issue is a sensitive one and some mothers will choose to go abroad for a termination for some serious congenital anomalies.  We do not have information on that.  It is the same in the United States in that they have a network of registries that monitor all the birth defects as well.  The statistics are reliable and will provide the actual numbers so we rely on the data from Europe and from ourselves.  <\/p> <p>  In recent years, within the Irish situation, there have been some difficulties in gathering data, particularly in the east.  There are three registries in Ireland - one in the east, one in the south-east, and one in the south.  They monitor, between them, about 62% of births for congenital anomalies.  They were operating fairly efficiently up until about three, four, or five years ago when data protection limitations began to cause some issues.  These were due to be addressed in the Health Information Bill, which we have been expecting for some time, which would give cover that would allow the registry to operate efficiently so that there would be accurate data on neural tube defects and all other types of birth defect.  At this stage, a couple of the registries are experiencing difficulty in gathering data on birth defects, including neural tube defects and that is why there have had to be special national studies to see what the number of neural tube defects were from 2009 to 2011.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.  <\/p> <p>  The ideal situation would be that there would be a national registry within Ireland that would monitor all birth defects, including neural tube defects so one could see every year what the situation is rather than have to have a special survey in 2005 to 2006 and then another one in 2009 to 2011 and maybe another one later on.  There is need for a national registry and this has been part of the recommendations of the folic acid committee that was set up, the Implementation Group on Folic Acid Fortification.  In their recommendations, they suggested there should be national surveillance on neural tube defects.  So the legislation to allow that to happen needs to be put in place.  It is not actually a financial issue because the capacity is probably just about there to do it within the current system - it is a legislative issue.  That needs to be done. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Bob McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1688,"content":"<p>When Dr. McDonnell says it is a legislative issue, in a hierarchy, is it a priority?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#H00700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435221000,"counter":1689,"content":"<p>Yes, it is an absolute priority.

We know that the ultrasound services for diagnostic purposes are far better in the big academic centres than in the 13 smaller units.  This may be part of another discussion on the maternity services but the ultrasound services in the smaller hospitals are deficient.  The committee has heard a lot of talk about this.

Professor Turner cited the recent study which showed it decreased from 2009 to 2013. The recommendation in 2006 from the Department of Health was that there should be mandatory fortification of staple foods in Ireland.  As a work up to this, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland did a baseline study of the incidences of neural tube defects, between 2005 and 2007, which was fairly low.  The food industry anticipated there would be fortification, and there was a lot of voluntary fortification of their breads, cereals, milks, etc., in advance of this because they knew it was coming down the line.  The effect was that it seemed to increase the levels of folic acid in women's blood.  When the FSAI actually looked at the amount of voluntary fortification occurring during that period it found that the food producers were overestimating the amounts required and putting a lot more folic acid into the products that they should have been.  In 2008, when the incidences of NTDs had decreased, when women's folic acid levels were quite high and when there was already voluntary fortification happening, it was decided to not fortify.  The world food producers were advised that they had a lot of folic acid in their products and they then decreased the amount in their products.  That will have decreased the amount of folic acid that women were getting.  We did our own survey for the period 2009-11 and we saw that the numbers of incidences of neural tube defects had crept back up again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Bob McDonnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435221000,"counter":1695,"content":"<p>The EU regulates food fortification.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland confirmed that there was a scheme in place for folic acid fortification but it was withdrawn in Ireland in 2010 because the EU introduced legislation on the addition of vitamins and minerals, which made the then folic acid flash labelling scheme superfluous.  This is being driven at EU level so questions around mandatory food fortification cannot be answered just by ourselves for a number of reasons.  Food and food ingredients now cross borders so it is difficult to try to regulate nationally.  Regulation and monitoring of mandatory fortification requires an EU approach because there is a big difference between having something on the label and measuring the folic acid in the food.  There is an urgency now for the EU to get its act together.  The British Medical Association recommends mandatory food fortification but the EU governments are sitting on their hands on this important issue.  This is partly due to the fact that, clinically, the issue of neural tube defects is not as important in other countries as it is in this country - they deal with the problem differently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Michael Turner"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1696,"content":"<p>We have good primary care centres across the country and GP practices, where there are television sets.

People attend GP practices for many reasons, including younger people who may have children in the future.  Knowing my own girls and their friends, I find that many young people, young women in particular, are very conscious of their image and what they eat and they eat healthier.  When buying foods they make efforts to get more vegetables and fruit.  Much of this goes to the old-fashioned family lifestyle.

I am joined this morning by colleagues from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Ms. Elizabeth Canavan, assistant secretary and Dr. Anne-Marie Brooks, principal officer.  I know that the joint committee is doing its own work on child care and family issues, and welcome the opportunity to discuss issues of common interest.  This morning&rsquo;s discussion also gives us an opportunity to hear and reflect on the views of the committee as we reach the final stages of our own work.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The inter-Departmental group, IDG, which I chair, was established by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in January of this year.  Its purpose is to identify and assess policies and future options for improving the affordability, quality and supply of services in the early years and school-age care and education sector in Ireland.  The group comprises officials from all of the Departments with a significant interest in the area, namely, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Social Protection, Education and Skills, Justice and Equality, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, and the Department of the Taoiseach.  We have met on five occasions to date, and have also worked bilaterally within and beyond the Departments which are on the IDG itself.  We have consulted with key stakeholders, both directly and online.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Children and Youth Affairs led an open policy debate with a range of stakeholders from the early years and school-age care and education sector on 31 March.  We also hosted an online public consultation process aimed at providers, practitioners, academics and advocates, together with a separate consultation process, also online, aimed directly towards parents.  The inputs from these processes have proved very useful and will be fully reflected in the final report of the inter-departmental group.  The Department has had valuable assistance in developing cost estimates and in facilitating and analysing outputs from the open policy debate and the online consultation processes from the Centre for Effective Services, Start Strong and Pobal, for which we are very grateful.<\/p><p>The Government currently spends some &euro;260 million each year on early years and school-age care and education services.  The bulk of this, approximately &euro;246 million, goes on three programmes for approximately 100,000 children and aims to improve the affordability, accessibility and quality in the sector.  The three programmes are the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, the community childcare subvention, CCS, and the training and employment childcare, TEC, programmes.  The remaining &euro;14 million is directed towards funding all city and county child care committees, the national voluntary child care organisations and a range of quality development and training initiatives such as the learner fund, better start, childminder development grants and toddler group grants.<br\/><br\/>In addition to these forms of direct investment, the State spends some &euro;2.2 billion on a range of child-related payments including the universal child benefit and the targeted schemes of family income supplement, back to school clothing and footwear, and guardians' payments.  Finally, the Government spent almost &euro;270 million on maternity benefit and adoptive benefit entitlements in 2014.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the interdepartmental group's work, the committee will appreciate that it is ongoing and that I cannot pre-empt what its final conclusions will be.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will wish to bring the report to Government for consideration in the first instance.  However, I think it might be helpful to outline the overall policy objectives with which the group is dealing and to sketch out what we are trying to achieve in terms of quality, affordability and accessibility of services and outputs.  <br\/><br\/>In the first instance, I think it is fair to say that our work is very much in keeping with the previously stated objectives of Government policy.  In line with our terms of reference we are aiming to promote optimal development for all children and to narrow the gap in attainment between more and less advantaged children through the provision of quality early childhood care and education services.  This is pursued at present, for example, through the ECCE scheme.  We aim to enable parents to prepare for a return to paid employment by participating in training, education and other activation measures.  At present we pursue this under the suite of training and education child care programmes.  We aim to support families, particularly those in low paid employment, in making work pay.  Currently we aim to do this, for example, through the community child care subvention.<br\/><br\/>Uniting these three objectives is the goal of reducing poverty.  We know that poverty is inter-generational; quality investment in the early years benefits all children, but the poorest children benefit most from the developmental opportunities.  Investment prepares children to reap benefits from school attendance.  More than three quarters of poor children live in jobless households.  To tackle child poverty effectively, we need to develop the services and supports that will help their parents earn enough to leave poverty permanently.  We aim to achieve this through the programmes I have just mentioned, in conjunction with income support measures such as child benefit, family income supplement and lone parents schemes.<br\/><br\/>These four objectives are very much interrelated and can work in a complementary way.  However, there can also be tensions between them.  For example, cheaper child care in a deregulated environment might support easier access and greater affordability, but it could have a detrimental effect on children through poor quality of service.  Similarly, a rapid introduction of a very high bar of qualifications could have a positive effect on children&rsquo;s outcomes, but at the expense of higher cost, restricted supply of places and problems of affordability and access for parents.  The challenge for the interdepartmental group, therefore, is to keep these objectives in balance and at all times to remember that the needs of children must come first when we are designing our child care policies. <br\/><br\/>We want to address three key concerns for the sector - affordability, quality and accessibility.  In terms of affordability of services the critical issues are the cost of child care supports for parents and sustainability issues for providers.  Parents need to be able to afford services at reasonable cost, which has of course been an issue of considerable concern in the debate.  We are conscious of the importance of ensuring a sustainable early years service for providers, so that services can be offered in a stable environment and parents can be reassured about continuity of provision.  However, we must also be concerned with affordability for the Exchequer and any options that are put forward must be realistic, implementable and demonstrate their value.<br\/><br\/>In terms of quality, we want parents to be reassured about the standards applied to the services given to children.  This raises issues about training and qualifications of the workforce, the standards of facilities and the way in which quality is monitored and assessed.  International research underlines the importance of quality in this sector.  The literature indicates that although access is a key issue, access without quality may even be detrimental to children.  Similarly, the research indicates that high quality is of particular value to vulnerable children.<br\/><br\/>In the case of accessibility, we are concerned with the supply of services, including their availability within a reasonable geographic distance, and the ability of parents and their children to use the service in a way that meets their needs.  <br\/><br\/>Within our terms of reference we are examining the issue of after-school services.  This includes the need to explore models of provision, to develop a quality infrastructure and to make it accessible and affordable.  From the perspective of the interdepartmental group's work, it is important to say that we have been asked to develop costed options for consideration by Government.  Our job is to examine the current system and to put forward possible approaches for Government.  It will, of course, be a matter for Government to decide on its priorities and to set a strategic platform for any additional investment it wishes to devote to the sector in the coming years.  The interdepartmental group's brief is designed to help Government by identifying possible options for consideration and by estimating their respective costs and benefits.<b><\/b><br\/><br\/>The latest census data, in respect of 2014, indicates that there are approximately 436,000 children aged between nought and five years and almost 460,000 children aged six to 12 years living in Ireland.  Of these, about 18.3% live in a lone parent household and 5.8% of them have a disability.  The latest data from the EU survey on income and living conditions estimates that some 7.4% of nought to five year olds and 11.1% of six to 12 year olds are classified as living in consistent poverty.<br\/><br\/>In this context, the value of initiatives in the early years and school-age sector has been well documented in the international literature.  It is clear that quality investment in this area improves outcomes for children and families.  Properly designed, investment can help children to benefit more from school and it can compensate to a degree for inequalities in other factors related to disadvantage and parental income.  Investment is associated with better health for children, better employment attributes, lower crime, less need for social interventions and greater civic contribution as well as the economic benefits to society of a more skilled workforce, higher productivity and direct employment effects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1704,"content":"<p>There is a vote in the D&aacute;il so I propose we let Dr. Lynch finish his remarks and we will then suspend until after the vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#M00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435221000,"counter":1705,"content":"<p>Most important, well-structured investment benefits children directly and that should be our key concern.<\/p> <p>  The interdepartmental group's terms of reference refer specifically to children with special needs.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has recognised the problems faced by some children in accessing the free preschool programme, although some measures have been in place to try to ensure easier access.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where the child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, the pre-school year can be split over two years on a pro rata basis, for example using the programme for two days a week in the first year and three days a week in the second year.<\/p> <p>  Recently, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, and Health agreed to work together to improve things by developing a new model of supports for pre-school children with special needs.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is leading the process with full and active support from the other two Departments and their respective agencies.  A group comprising representatives from these three Departments, the HSE, Tusla, the National Council for Special Education, the National Disability Authority, Better Start and the Dublin City Childcare Committee has started its work.  We aim to have an agreed model by early September, with a view to making a cross-departmentally supported proposal for the resources required in time for the Estimates process.  There will, no doubt, be challenges to agreeing an appropriate and workable model for children and implementing it but we are determined to address this long-standing issue to the benefit of children with special needs.

We have had a number of successful sessions on early childhood care and education.  There is common agreement across all political parties and independent Members that we need to see greater investment in high-quality and affordable child care.  While I welcome the establishment of the interdepartmental group, I question why it has taken so long to establish it.  However, it is not for any of the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p><p>The previous early years strategy took up us to 2010 and we are still awaiting the publication of the new strategy.  I believe that a lot of policy developed in the past number of years on a very <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis with no overarching strategy or vision.  Has the strategy been finalised?  If so, when will it be published?  Is it feeding into the interdepartmental group in respect of specific initiatives the Department is working on?<\/p><p>Dr. Lynch spoke about bringing forward costed options.  Has he been given a target for the size of the allocation in respect of which he will be permitted to make proposals?  We are all acutely aware of the existing allocation but has he been given a direction by the Minister on increasing expenditure by a certain amount and, if so, can he bring forward proposals to match the expenditure?<\/p><p> I have repeatedly raised over recent years the issue of special educational needs provision.  Why has a second working group been established to investigate special educational needs?  Surely this should be dealt with as a priority area by the existing interdepartmental group, which already brings together the main stakeholders.  Is the framework for action on the inclusion of children with special educational needs and early education, which was commissioned in 2010 by the Department of Education and Skills, being considered?  It is to the detriment of young children with learning difficulties that we have a plan which is not being implemented.  That is a disgrace.<\/p><p> I was concerned to hear the claim that a new model may benefit from piloting.  If the Minister made that claim I would see it as a fancy way of saying it would be implemented on a phased basis rather than through a national roll-out.  Supports for children with special educational needs are good in some areas but more limited in others.  We need to deal with that inconsistency.  Can the witnesses confirm whether the supports will be in place for the free preschool year in 2015?<\/p><p> Quality was a common thread throughout Dr. Lynch's presentation, and rightly so.  What is the status of the eight-point quality plan?  The new standards have not been announced and the qualification requirements have been delayed by 12 months.  Everyone I have engaged with on this subject has stressed the importance of having a qualified workforce.  A target was set whereby everyone would have a level six qualification by September 2015 but that was kicked down the line by 12 months.  When will the early years strategy be published?  Why is the new registration process is still not operational despite the fact we put the legislation in place?  These tangible quality improvement measures should have been delivered by now.<\/p><p> In regard to the community child care subvention, CCS, scheme, in 2013 the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, launched a report commissioned by the Donegal county child care committee.  She gave a clear commitment that the scheme was under review and acknowledged that the CCS segregated children from less well-off families and that, by virtue of the fact it is only available in community facilities, two thirds of services are not eligible to provide the scheme.  This has meant that some of the most vulnerable families have been left without the necessary supports because of their geographical location.  Yesterday I attended a cross-party seminar on prevention and early intervention which set out stark evidence on the importance of early intervention.  The CCS scheme could provide a funding stream to help children from the most vulnerable of families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#O00400","speaker":"1065","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1712,"content":"<p>I note a vote is taking place in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#P00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1713,"content":"<p>I understand there will also be a vote in the Seanad shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#P00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1714,"content":"<p>Does Deputy McLellan wish to speak now or shall we suspend the committee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#P00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1715,"content":"<p>I do not mind.

The issue of the crisis in the quality of child care in the State has come up repeatedly during our hearings.  The Government is about to be monitored on quality.  The European Council of Ministers last week approved the employment performance monitor for 2015.  For Ireland, the report identifies the availability of affordable and quality child care as a key challenge for Ireland and one the Commission will monitor.  Is the Minister serious about improving quality?  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs recently rode back on the minimum qualifications for child care workers, as Deputy Troy stated earlier.  What is the reasoning behind this and how does the Minister intend to put the issue of quality firmly on the child care agenda?<\/p> <p>  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has published a list of questions for the Government.  Question No. 12 asks that the Government provide updated information on measures taken to provide early childhood education, particularly for children with disabilities, and provide information on measures to ensure teachers and schools are provided with the necessary training and resources to address the needs of children from ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities.  Given the significant barriers to access for children with disabilities in this State, what does the Minister plan to do on this?<\/p> <p>  There was a proposal last week suggesting to increase investment to facilitate lower child-staff ratios to support children with special needs.  There is a different group looking into special needs, according to a letter we got from the Minister last week.  Could this be considered and is the Department suggesting the capitation rate should be increased for children with special needs?  Does this include SNA support?<\/p> <p>  The other issue with special needs is whether there will be a guarantee to a full second free preschool year for children with additional needs.  Such children have broken-up time over two years but my party believes this is detrimental to their progress.  It has been brought to our attention that sometimes children are not diagnosed in the first year, they may be diagnosed late on and they may have to go home for a year if the parents cannot afford it.  This latter issue is significant.

What are the Minister's plans to implement a system of registration, inspection and support in order that childminders do not work in complete isolation, as they do currently?

To make a declaration of interest, I am the chairperson of Early Childhood Ireland, but that is a governance role and I am not necessarily advocating its positions.<\/p> <p>  My first question is in regard to inspections.  Is consideration being given to bringing inspections together and to who should take the lead?  There is a strong role there for the Department of Education and Skills.  I am concerned about the rates of pay for those working in the sector.  One sees advertisements at assistant director level for primary health care nurses, who are not qualified in child care, to be in the position of inspecting people in child care who are qualified and who are being paid less than the minimum wage.  The State has something to say about that.  With regard to the inspections, I heard of a case early this week where a child care setting was told that children under three would no longer have access to the sandpit because there are six steps up to it, and we all know that children do not live where there are steps.  It is as if children live in a flat world.  Many cr&egrave;ches find that we are not allowing children to deal with steps, negotiate hills and so forth.  I worry about it the more I visit child care settings.  They all have mats and it is all a safe flat world.

One has to know what is required as one goes down through the ratios of two days per week versus three days per week.  If the child does not attend, they are expected to return the money even though they have paid for the staff member.  All the cards appear to be held by the Department, not the providers.  Is the Department considering some type of anticipatory model for additional needs?  We have very good statistics on children to know, on average, the needs that will be presenting geographically.  Is there a way we could examine a model to anticipate?  If there were additional needs above that, perhaps that could be brought into consideration.<\/p> <p>  Regarding after-school care, will the Department be introducing clear guidance and regulation for that area?  One of the questions I have been asked is why the ratios will change if one has a child or children in the classroom.

Many of the issues I intended to raise have been raised.  However, there is the issue of commercial rates in respect of child care facilities and the cost to the facility.  On the one hand the Department is disbursing money to the facility and, on the other, a local authority takes it back.  Can that issue be tackled, and speedily?  It is extremely important.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I raised earlier in a private discussion is the Life Centre in Cork, where there are 45 children who have dropped out of school.  They do not fit into any category.  The Department of Education and Skills says it is not its problem.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and I have met the Minister, says it is not its problem, and the Department of Justice and Equality says the same.  The 45 children have dropped out of the school system.  School attendance officers have no difficulty in referring them to the centre but it is only getting &euro;47,500 per annum.  When I visited Oberstown I looked at the figures for that facility.  One person there costs approximately &euro;350,000 per year.  Even if one person exited the facility we are providing in the Life Centre in Cork to Oberstown, and I am not saying that will happen, it is a huge cost issue.  One size does not fit all and we have people who do not fit into the education system.  The issue is how we deal with that and how we react at a very early stage, not when it is gone beyond where we can help the child and help the parents to keep the child out of difficulties and out of the criminal justice system.

Rather than repeat the issues, as there are many similar threads, I wish to tease out some of the issues that have been raised over recent weeks and years.<\/p> <p>  The responsibility for the development of S&iacute;olta and Aistear is with the Department of Education and Skills.  However, it was pointed out to the committee last week that students study early childhood studies in, for example, UCC, Cork Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology, or wherever it might be.  Would the witnesses envisage that those programmes could be delivered to the students who aspire to work in early years education rather than delivering it to them when they come into the workforce?  I understand that there is practical implementation, but perhaps it could be done in an introductory way in order that we know the people who are coming into the workforce are familiar with, and have a working knowledge of, the curricula we want them to implement.  There must be creative thinking about this.  There appears to be a huge difference in the access that child care workers and early years educators have to these training programmes versus primary school teachers, who appear to have received the Rolls-Royce version of training.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment on that.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of children with additional needs, do the witnesses have a view about what works?  The letter we received from the Minister last week stated that there is no agreement about a model.  Has the group looked at it in any way?  The issue of special needs assistants has arisen from time to time.  The minimum qualification for a special needs assistant is the junior certificate.  It does not presuppose any developmental knowledge in terms of what is appropriate for a child or what developmental goals a child should be meeting in a preschool setting.  That would concern me.  My preference would be to have additional staff in the setting who are able to cater for the individual child.  That is what early years education is about.  The child would simply present with additional needs rather than having a disability.  That is my thinking on it, and I hope the witnesses will comment on it.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is funding based on quality rather than opening it up to everyone, and that where quality standards are met, it is rewarded.  That is something we struggle to do in public services all the time, but this is a watershed time for early years education and it is something we should be ambitious in trying to achieve.<\/p><p> There is a plethora of grants which providers can access.  Has the group given any thought to combining grants in a central fund rather than adopting a piecemeal approach?  I refer, in particular, to independent and community-based providers because accessing them is hugely time consuming.  There is much talk about quality, but I do not think \"non-contact time\" is the appropriate term to use.  It is important in the early years to engage a child by means of his or her interests.  Staff cannot be expected to do this off the cuff because it forms an integral part of planning, arranging and implementing the curriculum in the classroom, as well as deciding what is and is not working.  If we are serious about ensuring quality, the interdepartmental group should advocate for investment in the service, with particular reference to the terms and conditions of those who work in it.  All studies dating back to the 1970s have found that high levels of training, as well as good relationships between children and the workers are very important.<\/p><p> I refer to the alarming reports that those attending early years education training courses at third level try to get out of it as quickly as possible.  I do not blame them when we hear that people working in fast food outlets are being paid more than they are.  The Government contracts providers to provide the service.  We can talk about the matter until the cows come home, but significant investment will be required to improve the quality of care provide to benefit children.<\/p><p> I refer to an excellent suggestion made in recent weeks about having an early years education national week, a national campaign to be led by the Department and the Department of Education and Skills, to illustrate the importance of early years education.  It would not just be of benefit to children but would also benefit us all if we had a good quality early years child care and education system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#S00600","speaker":"1093","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435221000,"counter":1733,"content":"<p>I thank committee members for their comments and questions.  I will begin with an issue raised by Deputy Sandra McLellan because it is a theme common to all questions, that is, whether we have looked at what the committee has been doing.  I can confirm that we have.  I have gone through all of the transcripts and issues raised.  It is important that we join up all of the work done in that context.  I reassure the committee that the Department is not doing something in a separate environment.  I will work my way through the questions from members and group them as best I can.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Robert Troy asked about the future plans for the early years strategy and whether there was an overarching strategy.  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures is the overarching strategy which was published in April 2014.  It forms the basis for everything we do.  There are a number of constituent strategies, the most recent being the national participation strategy which was launched by the Minister last week.  The youth strategy will be launched shortly.  We are working on the early years strategy specifically, but as there are only so many things a small number of people can do at the one time, we are working our way through it as best we can.  As I said, the overarching strategy is Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, on which we have made reasonable progress.<\/p> <p>  On costed options and targets and whether we have been given targets for the future, the Government has not specified a specific sum of money.  However, the clear running instructions we have been given are to incur realistic costs on the basis of realistic implementation options.  There is no suggestion that it is simply an option for one year; we are talking about a developmental process - I hope an investment platform - over a number of years.  The options we will suggest will be on that basis.  There is no specific sum of money, but we will look at the matter in each case in terms of costs and benefits.  We have done a good deal of work in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There was a series of questions on the subject of special educational needs.  The most important question is why a second group is necessary.  It is being established for a very good reason.  The overall interdepartmental group I chair is trying to set costed options for the Government covering the entire sector.  The group we set up recently to look at special educational needs has a very specific purpose, which is to develop a model which would be agreed, I hope, between the sectors of health, education and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We have had difficulty in agreeing on what the model should be and how it should operate.  That is why it is being done in this way.  We are drawing on the expertise of the National Disability Authority, the NCSE, Tusla, the Better Start programme and so on.  The group has a larger number of representatives than the interdepartmental group specifically, but it is important-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1734,"content":"<p>When is it expected to be ready?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#T00300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435221000,"counter":1735,"content":"<p>We hope to have it by early September in order that it will also be able to feed into the process.

It will be dealt with in the youth strategy which we hope to finalise shortly.<\/p> <p>  To conclude my remarks on the special educational needs element, Deputy Robert Troy also asked about pilot schemes.  I emphasise that there is no intention that pilot schemes will slow us down.  We hope our overall approach will include other aspects that will benefit children with special needs.  It is to try to have the model developed by early September in order that it can be introduced as part of the overall structure.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about progress made on the eight point quality plan.  I will deal with a couple of its elements, the first being early years education regulations.  We are working intensively on them and hope to produce them as quickly as possible.  They will be a significant step forward.  We have run into some practical legal difficulties.  Currently there are regulations and guidelines.  Effectively, the new system will comprise the regulations and guidelines incorporated into legal structures, but the process has proved more difficult and it is taking longer than we would have liked to complete.  However, we are working intensively on it and I can assure the Deputy that we will bring forward the regulations for the Minister's consideration as quickly as possible.  I do not wish to put too specific a timeframe on it because each time we think we are there we run into another practical legal issue.  We place huge emphasis on the regulations, but we would like to get them right because there is no point in us producing them and then finding that there is a flaw in or a specific difficulty with them.<\/p> <p>  A number of Deputies and Senators asked about the qualifications required and why we had pushed back the qualification requirements to be met to September 2016 when initially they were to be met by September 2015.  We were reluctant to do so, but we had to recommend to the Minister that this happen for a number of practical and logistical reasons.  The most practical reason has to do with community-based services and community employment scheme workers.  By definition, a number of community employment scheme workers tend not to have the qualification.<\/p><p>If they were no longer counted for the purposes of the ECCE scheme, in other words, if they became supernumery, then that would have significant implications for some of the centres.  In some other instances, child care workers have worked their way through and got the qualification.  It should be acknowledged that it is a significant qualification which, as far as I can recall, is comprised of eight modules.  While a number of people have made good progress, not all of them would have been qualified by September 2015.  If we had applied that aspect immediately from September 2015 then we would have run into a serious practical issue of service provision.  There will always be an issue of quality versus an ability to provide a service in an appropriate timeframe, which is a theme that I shall return to later.  That is why we approached the matter in the particular way that we did. <\/p><p> Let me outline some of the other things that we have been doing, under the quality agenda.  There is the education focused inspections which we are about to start.  There is the fact that Tusla is now publishing its own report online and has done so since the middle of 2013.  It soon will publish retrospective reports as well.  There are a number of things, under the heading of quality, that we are anxious to progress as quickly as possible. <\/p><p> A number of Deputies raised questions on how the schemes operate.  They certainly struck a chord as a number of people have said that they are confusing, that a lot of them operate in different circumstances and different rules apply to schemes such as the CCS and TEC programmes.  The comments will form part of our review.  The question of whether one could streamline or make them more accessible will also be taken on board.  <\/p><p> Equally, I take the point made by Deputy Troy about the Donegal report.  It is not ideal to have segregation, in some instances, between the community and independent or private side, with the term depending on how one describes it.  That is something we will take into account in what we are proposing as well.  We are anxious to get the matter right, if at all possible.<\/p><p> I have dealt with Deputy McLellan's question on quality.  On the disabilities issue, she asked me about increased capitation and special needs assistant supports.  The overall question on how we deal with this will be looked at in the context of the interdepartmental group.  Obviously we are looking at a number of different ways in which supports can be given in the future.  One question which has been raised repeatedly is should we have an increased capitation payment.  Another question that has been regularly raised is should we at least restore the cut that was introduced a number of years ago. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1741,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#U00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1435221000,"counter":1742,"content":"<p>All of those issues will certainly be looked at and there is a series of drivers that will help us in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I shall make an overall point about all of these questions because a number of Deputies and Senators wanted to know our thoughts.  In summary, we are trying to develop options that will appropriately cover the areas of early years, school-age after-school and special needs and will also meet the requirements of affordability, quality and accessibility.  I am not suggesting that every option will cover or tick every one of those boxes.  I suggest that a combination of those will, hopefully, produce a significant improvement and all of that clearly depends on investment.  I have stressed from the beginning of the meeting, and in my opening statement, that the level and extent of investment is a matter for the Government to decide.  <\/p> <p>  The registration of childminders is an area that we would like to look at in the context of the interdepartmental group.  Clearly, there are a number of other quality issues that we are pursuing.  Obviously we must prioritise issues of that kind.  Certainly, as this is a quality issue, we would like to link the subventions to quality in each instance.  I think that is an important way of doing things.<\/p> <p>  In terms of some of the questions that Senator van Turnout raised, I shall first refer to the question of joint inspections.  I am conscious that there is Tusla, Pobal, the Department of Education and Skills and so on.  I suppose in an ideal world, and perhaps at some future stage, we would have a situation where one would have one single common inspection.  I am not going to pretend such development is easy or that it will happen quickly.  At the moment we are focusing on making sure that there is good co-ordination between them.  We have, for example, established a group that now meets to ensure there is good co-ordination and co-operation between the different forms of inspection.  The last thing we want to do is impose an unnecessary administrative burden on any of the providers.<\/p> <p>  The capacity of the sector and the role played by the State is another issue that was raised by Senator van Turnhout and other speakers touched on the same subject.  One of the things that we certainly wanted to do is get ourselves into a situation where we can develop a model of future needs.  We can, for example, draw on the model that the Department of Education and Skills already uses for projecting places in primary schools and we will draw on that information.  We are conscious, for example, that at a practical level, and as investment grows, if that is what the Government decides, and we create further incentives for more usage of these services then, inevitably, these measures will have a cost issue.  Equally, they will have a capacity issue.  It is true to say about 10% of children are in centre-based care.  It is possible that as we develop this sector, improve quality, and if the Government decides that it can invest further, then obviously those aspects will have an implication for places and numbers.  We must examine the matter very carefully.<\/p> <p>  In terms of commercial rates, I hear what Senator Colm Burke is saying.  We will certainly take his comments into account.  Obviously the rules relating to rates are outside the Department's jurisdiction but we will take account of the matter.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also mentioned the Life Centre in Cork.  Certainly, if there is any area where centres or services are falling between the cracks then we need to pursue that.  One possible option would be looking at funding from dormant accounts.  Pobal is running such a scheme at the moment.  I think the applications for the scheme are open but they will close in the next couple of weeks.  It is an idea that is worth pursuing.  Similarly, I think there is a role here for the youth strategy that we hope to finalise soon.  In particular, there is an issue here in regard to transitions between different age groups and transitions between forms of education and care.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Deputy Conway's questions on S&iacute;olta and Aistear, we are extremely committed to helping the Department of Education and Skills to develop as much as we possibly can.  The group will look at how best to roll out these schemes and continuing professional development is an important element.  The whole area of professionalising and helping to professionalise the workforce is one that we are very much attached to.  Again, it probably brings us back to the tensions that I talked about in my opening statement between achieving the right level of quality, affordability and accessibility.  Sometimes it is difficult to achieve all three at the one time but we must strike the right balance.<\/p> <p>  In terms of some of the schemes such as CCS, TEC and others, I take the point that they can be time consuming and confusing.  One additional point I would make is that the programmes implementation platform, PIP, will help us in terms of running the schemes and helping people to understand them.  Certainly, if and when the Government decides that it is moving forward in terms of investment, we will take that aspect into account when designing what we put in place.<\/p> <p>  Let me check if there are other specific questions that should be raised.  In regard to the early years strategy, I wish to put on record that we hope to have it done later this year.  It is a significant priority for us.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the suggestion to have a national week dedicated to early years education, we would be happy to do anything we can in that regard, particularly to help parents understand and take on board the importance of quality as well as issues of affordability in this regard.  I hope I have covered a reasonable number of the questions in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1743,"content":"<p>I shall allow Deputies Troy and Conway to make a brief comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2015062500002#U00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1435221000,"counter":1744,"content":"<p>I asked what work is being done by the interdepartmental group and the new second group in terms of special educational needs.
