Last week, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, published an apprenticeship implementation plan.  This involves, among other things, the establishment of a new apprenticeship council to oversee the development of this area of training and on-the-job experience.  This follows on from a review of apprenticeships in Ireland.

My name is Phil O'Flaherty and I lead the Department&rsquo;s further education and training section.  I am joined by Keith Moynes from our higher education policy section and Denis Rowan and Chris Feeney from SOLAS.  Today&rsquo;s session is timely, as the Minister published an implementation plan for the review&rsquo;s recommendations just last week.<\/p><p>  Significant reform is under way across our education and training system and much of this is focused on close engagement with employers to ensure we tailor our programmes to deliver the best work opportunities for learners and continue to develop the sector as an engine for economic growth.  The renewal of the apprenticeship system is a major part of that overall reform programme.  While the time is ripe for a review of the apprenticeship system, the committee should appreciate that apprenticeship has served learners, employers and the wider economy very well over a long number of years.  It is a good product, producing highly skilled crafts people in demand throughout the world and competing strongly in the world skills competitions.<\/p><p>  Dual training models offer enormous potential to produce practically focused, work-ready people serving the skill needs of the economy across a range of sectors.  That said, apprenticeship currently has a narrow industrial base which exposes it strongly to the domestic economic cycle and lacks flexibility in its overall structure.  The economic downturn exposed difficulties with the model and it has taken an enormous effort on behalf of a range of stakeholders, including SOLAS, to provide opportunities for redundant apprentices to complete their training.  It was in this context that the apprenticeship review was undertaken.<\/p><p>  The Minister launched the review of apprenticeship in May 2013.  It was led by an independent group, chaired by Kevin Duffy, chair of the Labour Court.  We have two members of that group here today, as both Peter Rigney and Tony Donohoe served on it, and they can probably give some insights into the group's thinking on the recommendations produced.  The review group invited submissions and consulted widely in producing its report, which it delivered to the Minister in December 2013.  The Minister published the report in January.<\/p><p>  A summary of the detailed set of recommendations contained in the report is in the full presentation I provided, but I will highlight a couple of key points.  While strongly calling for flexibility in structure and delivery, the review group adopted a view of apprenticeship as requiring to be sufficiently substantial in depth and duration to deliver skilled workers who can work competently and autonomously.   It stated that apprenticeship programmes should no shorter than two years and that at least half of this time should be spent on the job.  It saw the potential for apprenticeships to be delivered leading to awards from level 5 of the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, right up to level 10.<\/p><p>  The review group recommended the completion of the curriculum review under way for existing trades, leading to individual awards for each trade placed separately on the NFQ and with duration determined by learning outcomes.  The group recommended that governance of apprenticeship should be led by a new apprenticeship council, hosted by SOLAS but with strong co-operation from the Higher Education Authority.  The council should also co-ordinate a call for proposals for the development of apprenticeships in new enterprise sectors.<\/p> <p>The Minister published an implementation plan for the review recommendations on 30 June.  The plan adopts a phased approach to implementation, recognising the need to progress current work on existing apprenticeships and determine demand from new enterprise sectors through a call for proposals before embedding new arrangements in legislation.  This reflects the fact that an approach that begins with legislative change is likely to be slow, will not be enterprise-led in the first instance and will not best facilitate the flexibility required to explore and respond to issues that may be raised in the call for proposals from enterprise sectors.<\/p><p> The plan sets out how an apprenticeship council will be appointed this month and details a series of actions to renew existing apprenticeships and develop new ones.  These actions will be delivered in three phases.  Phase 1 will focus on existing apprenticeships being reviewed under the existing governance structures, while the apprenticeship council makes a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers for the development of new apprenticeships.  This call will be supported by dedicated resources.  The council will assess the proposals against a sustainability test and report to the Minister in the first half of next year on proposals which stand the best chance of being developed into quality sustainable apprenticeships.<\/p><p> Phase 2 involves the development of the apprenticeships in the successful sectors.  This will require establishing awarding arrangements, the development of detailed curricula and implementation arrangements.  This process is likely to take some time and vary across sectors, and will be complete from late 2015 into the first half of 2016.  In parallel, legislative implications will be examined to support the expanded system and provide protection for apprentices.<\/p><p> Phase 3 involves the embedding of new structures, including establishing the apprenticeship council on a statutory basis and bringing together the governance arrangements for existing and new apprenticeships.  This will provide a stable base for implementing the remaining key recommendations of the review group.<\/p><p> The Department is confident that we now have a good basis for renewing apprenticeship in Ireland as a strong model of learning in further and higher education and training.  We look forward to today&rsquo;s discussion with the committee and the other contributors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil O'Flaherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404909000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it on a very important issue for the business sector.  I look after education and social policy in IBEC.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Dermot Doherty, who is from the Irish Medical Devices Association, one of the sectoral groups that has established a track record of working with education and training providers and has an interest in this area.  IBEC's submission to the apprenticeship review group has been circulated to the committee and I will be pleased to address any issues arising from it that members wish to raise.<\/p><p>  My comments, however, mainly concern the report of the review group itself and, more particularly, the Department&rsquo;s implementation plan referred to by Mr. O'Flaherty.  As committee members are aware, the current apprenticeship system, which is limited to 26 occupations, does not reflect the broader skill needs of the Irish economy.  A fixed legislative structure makes it difficult for the system to adapt to economic and technological developments.  A fixed duration of four years in all cases but one, and a fixed award, regardless of the learning outcome also creates inefficiencies.  Female participation is negligible. <\/p><p>  The starting point for any consideration of new apprenticeship models usually includes a reference to the well-established dual systems of countries such as Austria, Germany and Switzerland.  Much of the commentary, however, tends to ignore the fact that Ireland cannot simply adopt systems that have been built over generations, upon very different economies, labour markets and social partnership arrangements.  We also have to acknowledge the reality that apprenticeships, and vocational education in general, tend not to enjoy parity of esteem in a society that defines educational achievement in terms of Central Applications Office, CAO, points.<\/p><p>  This is not to say that we do not have much to learn from other national systems.  In fact the apprenticeship review group report has tried to distil some of the principles on which they are based to inform a model that could work in an Irish context.  They include the following: employers and professional bodies are best placed to determine the content, outcome and demand for apprenticeships; expertise provided by education and training providers must also be at the heart of their design and delivery; apprenticeships must be able to respond flexibly to changing technology and market needs; apprenticeship development must be based on transferable skills including literacy and numeracy; different packages of work and learning, with distinct structures, curricula and pedagogy, may provide equally valid routes to enabling an apprentice to become competent in a job; distribution of the cost of training should be shared by all three parties, employers, apprentices, through the acceptance of a lower wage, and Government; apprenticeships should be available at all skill levels from school leaving, level 5 to advanced degree level 10, for countries such as Denmark have industrial PhDs; and governance or training delivery should not be predominantly within the domains either of further education and training or higher education, they should cross both levels which is very important in the context of the parity of esteem we seek for apprenticeships and the system should be underpinned by a robust and independent quality assurance regime.<\/p><p>  The review group&rsquo;s report certainly reflects these principles but the biggest challenge is moving from strategy to implementation.  The Department&rsquo;s implementation plan, which was published two weeks ago, can help us meet this challenge.  IBEC supports its recommendation for the establishment of a new enterprise-led apprenticeship council.  This council will issue a call for proposals from industry bodies working with education providers for the development of new apprenticeships.  The proposers will have to set out the programme&rsquo;s format, the main occupation needs to be addressed and how it meets a range of other criteria.  Mr. O'Flaherty has described the sustainability test.  The implementation plan comments that the capacity of relevant organisations to assume this role will have to be tested.  I am optimistic about this.  There are already numerous examples of businesses working with the higher education sector in particular to source their training.  There are fewer examples in the further education sector but the recent further education and training strategy has named that and seeks to address it. <\/p><p>  Some employers also provide input on curriculum development and work experience for students.  This trend has been given further impetus through the more advanced Skillnets networks, Momentum, the Springboard programme and the ICT conversion programmes which are designed and delivered in partnership with industry. <\/p><p>  I accept that the establishment of a new model requires a huge level of highly detailed work and the plan has set out a realistic timeframe.  We should remember, however, that we will not see these new apprenticeships coming on stream until the first half of 2016.  Thankfully, as the economic recovery takes hold, many companies are beginning to consider how they will meet their future skills requirements.  It would be a pity to miss this opportunity.  If the plan is to deliver, timelines must be adhered to and momentum maintained.  The development of the new apprenticeships must also be properly resourced.  As we move into the 2015 budgetary process, it is important that dedicated funding is allocated to promote the development and establishment of these apprenticeships in new occupational areas.  This should be viewed as a critical investment in our human capital, which will underpin our future economic prosperity.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC&rsquo;s views on this important initiative and urge them to provide every support possible to ensure its successful implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404909000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to it about what will be an extremely important aspect of Irish industrial policy and the education system in the immediate future.<\/p> <p>We fully support the implementation of the review of apprenticeship and look forward to working with employers and the State in this area.  Ireland is one of several member states to receive a recommendation on apprenticeship under the country-specific recommendations issued recently as part of the European semester process.  In fact, one is struck by how many other countries, as well as Ireland, have received a recommendation in this regard.<\/p><p> We are right to be proud of our success in this country in the area of designated trades.  However, our track record in embedding work-based learning in our education system is less impressive.  In the past two decades there have been two major reverses in this area.  One was the disappearance of the CERT apprenticeship system, leading to a situation where employers in the hospitality sector are now complaining about a lack of skills.  Second is the failure, following the apprenticeship reform of the early 1990s, to designate a significant number of additional trades.  A prime candidate for a pilot scheme for the extension of apprenticeship is the child care sector, which is facing a crisis of standards at this time.  The State exercises a predominant role in the sector through funding and regulation, a position which it can use to advance public policy in the apprenticeship area.<\/p><p> Moving towards some type of dual system will present challenges, especially in the area of funding.  Having said that, the EU initiative on a youth guarantee and the new phase of European Social Fund allocations will allow more financial latitude than we might have thought possible.  Another avenue of resourcing could be made available through an expanded national training fund.  That fund was established by diverting an element of employers' PRSI contribution - 0.7%, if I recall correctly - to a dedicated fund.  There is scope to divert a similar small percentage of employees' contribution to an enlarged fund that would support an expanded apprenticeship system.<\/p><p> It is important to note in any discussion of apprenticeship systems that governance is not an end in itself but must serve a purpose.  Societies design governance systems which achieve a purpose such as deliberation, information sharing or providing feedback.  There is ample evidence that the governance of vocational education and training systems works best when it is structured on a tripartite basis which focuses on ensuring the relevance of training offered and anchoring the training system to the enterprise stakeholders.  These strong links are pointed to by Viktoria Kis as an advantage of the Irish system in her 2010 study undertaken for the OECD.  Robust governance systems keep the courses offered close to the labour market and act as a check and balance on the power of providers.<\/p><p> If we look at the operational issues which affected - or, more accurately, afflicted - F&Aacute;S in the period prior to 2011, it is clear that many of them arose out of work done by private sector contract providers.  Similar problems arose with Skillnets, where a major breach involving both FETAC and HETAC providers was uncovered in the audit process and detailed in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  One of the lessons to be drawn from this is that the light-touch model of regulation adopted by FETAC and HETAC proved inadequate to deal with the risks posed by a very small number of unscrupulous private providers.  There is a strong argument, therefore, for the education and training institutions of the State to play the predominant role in providing the education and training element of any widened apprenticeship system.<\/p><p> Despite many efforts undertaken over the past two decades by State authorities, employers and unions, most apprenticeships remain strongly male dominated.  This is partly due to the fact that the construction, engineering and vehicle maintenance industries are in themselves strongly male dominated.  An obvious way of broadening the gender participation in apprenticeships would be to broaden the range of apprenticeships available.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the most significant gender issue in the Irish education and training sector is the under-achievement of young boys.  The apprenticeship system as currently structured goes some way to address this.<\/p><p> Entry requirements will vary from sector to sector.  In the event of a broader range of occupations being designated, they will vary even further.  There has been a suggestion, for instance, that some groups of employers would like to have level 8 degrees delivered in an apprenticeship format.  The stakeholders in the sector will set the minimum entry requirements and it will be up to SOLAS to ensure these requirements meet the needs of the occupation concerned and are not disguised barriers to entry.  <\/p><p> A more broadly-based system of apprenticeship would help to minimise dropout rates.  It would also help to address the under-achievement of young men in the education system, which is a common phenomenon in Europe.  Dr. Sean McDonagh, former principal of Dundalk IT, has pointed out that the country that finds a solution to this problem will derive a competitive advantage from it.  In addition, a more broadly-based apprenticeship system would ensure an enhanced supply of intermediate-level skills for our economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404909600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Rigney.

Reference was made to models of apprenticeship which have worked very well in other countries, particularly Denmark and Germany.  Will the witnesses outline the elements that make those systems work so well but which might not work in this country?  In the case of  the German model, my understanding is that students separate into streams at age 16, one being more academic and the other a more vocational route.  Currently and historically, Germany has had a very low percentage of students going on to higher education compared with other countries, presumably because of the significant numbers opting for the vocational route.  It is a system that seems to work well for that country.  Any additional information the delegates can give on the German system and which parts of it are not transferable to Ireland would be helpful.  I understand some of it is cultural, with German companies having very much bought into the system.  Will the delegates comment on the cultural position in respect of companies in the Irish market, including the various American companies which provide employment in different sectors such as pharmaceutical and information technology?  Is there scope for developing apprenticeships that can feed into those sectors?<\/p><p>  What is the situation in terms of the age profile of young people going into apprenticeships in this country?  Is there a need to develop a greater connection between our second level education system and the apprenticeship system?  For example, if the two were running in parallel and there was a greater crossover, students would not be obliged to leave the education system early.  Mr. Donohoe mentioned that there has historically been more engagement with industry at higher education level in terms of developing pathways than there has been at further education level.  Will he give his take on the dynamic behind that and how it might be addressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900006#F00300","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1404909600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their submissions.  I agree with Mr. Donohoe that the timelines are both ambitious and achievable.  They are also very much interlinked.  The point Mr. Donohoe made in regard to the need for funding to be pinpointed in budget 2015 is a critical one. The timelines that are envisaged would mean the Minister having to allocate resources in the second quarter of next year to bring this to the next stage.  If those moneys are not put in place in the upcoming budget in October, we are setting up a roadblock that is bound to delay progress in 2015.  There is some planning to do in this regard.  All of the submissions we are discussing today refer frequently to funding, financing and costing, but I do not see any actual figures.  How can we evaluate the amount of funding that will be required to ensure the timelines can be met?<br \/>We have had several references to the lack of gender balance in the apprenticeship system and the opportunity we have to address it.  Dr. Rigney stated that an obvious way to broaden gender participation is to broaden the range of apprenticeships types on offer.  He went on to observe:<blockquote>However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the most significant gender issue in the Irish education and training sector is the under-achievement of young boys.  The apprenticeship system as currently structured goes some way to address this.<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>I seek elaboration.  Does the current structure, which is mainly aimed at men, mean balance should be addressed through apprenticeships for women?  How can the gender balance be achieved?  How will sustainability criteria be set out?  Proposals for new apprenticeships will be measured by a sustainability test to see if they can proceed.  Apprenticeships have previously been based on needs, rather than being led by enterprise, but once needs change the apprenticeships become redundant.<\/p><p> The report and some of the presentations touched on the issue of the transferability of skills and this critical area must be developed.  We must create apprenticeship schemes that help develop numerous skills simultaneously.  For example, if the construction industry collapses an apprentice engineer, carpenter or bricklayer may not find work and therefore must learn other skills during his or her apprenticeship that will help the transfer to a new area of employment or further education.  Rather than joining a dole queue it is important that apprentices learn varied skills that will help them progress.  This issue of the transferability of skills will create a challenge in designing new courses and I presume the sustainability test will take it into account.  If the market for which apprenticeship skills were primarily intended collapses it is vital that those skills can be transferred elsewhere.  I seek more information on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900006#F00400","speaker":"984","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404910200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>When I was at school people said that as I was good with my hands I should be sent to the tech.  Conversely, I was told I had hands for nothing.  Being useless at most things I knew I had to become a teacher.  It is a straight line to level 10 and I like the idea of moving all the way to level ten.  It is wonderful that a young person completing an apprenticeship knows he or she can carry on all the way to a doctorate.<\/p><p>  A charge now applies to apprenticeships that is based on the registration fee for third-level students but perhaps this discourages potential apprentices.  How will SOLAS, which is responsible for much of this, deliver on the programme in the five education and training board areas that do not have training centres?  Will the chief executive officer of an education and training board that does not have a training centre in its region have any input?  This is an issue in some areas and I would like to see it ironed out as early as possible without a row.  This might not be easy but it is important, though it may not be the Department's responsibility.  I would like to know how SOLAS will address the problem.<\/p><p>  A reference was made to the German system and one of our aims is to increase tertiary education by 10%.  We need to educate people for jobs and some people currently undergoing apprenticeships will employ degree holders in future.  They are the entrepreneurs and wealth creators of the future.  An apprenticeship can be a very good thing and a university degree should not be viewed as the Holy Grail.  It may be sufficient that 50% of school leavers continue into the degree system.<\/p><p>  On further education, is it the case that colleges have no capital budget and cannot qualify for a summer works scheme?

Deputy McConalogue raised the issue of international models and there will be varying views on this as we can learn from some aspects and others represent too great a cultural leap.  The review group did not move towards the formal reintroduction of vocational and academic streams in upper second level schools.  Vocational routes exist in the leaving certificate programme but, from an institutional perspective, people in Ireland do not attend a school based on vocational or academic inclinations, unlike people in countries like Germany.<\/p> <p>There has been a long-standing concern on the part of parents that there should be a very broad offering across vocational and academic subjects at senior cycle in post-primary schools.  Colleagues from SOLAS will confirm the figure but I understand that well above 70% of people who enter apprenticeships complete the leaving certificate.  At present, therefore, apprenticeship is very much a post-secondary option.  Of course, the position varies across trades.  In that context, the entry rates among those who have only completed junior cycle in secondary school are higher in respect of certain trades.<\/p><p> Early school leaving is obviously a big issue for all countries in the European Union.  Ireland's performance in this regard has improved somewhat and the rate here - less than 10% - is below the overall EU target for 2020.  We want to reduce that rate even further nationally.  Vocational opportunities and apprenticeships are a means of ensuring that there are options available for people who learn best by doing and they certainly make a contribution in terms of reducing the rate of early school leaving.  It should be noted that the general picture in this regard has been improving for a good many years.<\/p><p> To return to the question on international models, we are of the view - I believe IBEC would probably agree with us - that great opportunities exist.  A number of companies with operations in Ireland originated in countries with strong apprenticeship traditions.  The European Alliance for Apprenticeships has indicated a willingness to engage more fully with the Irish apprenticeship system, especially if we expand the range of sectors in which it operates.  The experience of companies such as Siemens, SAP and others in the context of how they are set up to deal with apprenticeships is something from which we can learn.  The labour markets in countries such as Germany and Austria are highly regulated and the concept that, under law, people must have specific qualifications in order to undertake particular activities in the economy is very embedded.  This clearly supports an apprenticeship system because if a person is obliged to obtain a qualification in order to become a baker or whatever, there is a model of training in place to support him or her in doing so.  That would be a very big leap for Ireland.  We have a pretty liberal labour market and the flexibility which exists within it is seen, as least by some, as being of assistance in attracting foreign direct investment among other things.<\/p><p> The type of regulation to which I refer supports the apprenticeship systems in Germany and Austria.  In addition, the chambers model in those countries is very strong and allows the concept of apprenticeship to be supported and led by enterprise.  The structures upon which apprenticeship can be built in Ireland are probably becoming stronger.  What the Irish Medical Devices Association, which Mr. Doherty represents, has done is a good example of how a sector can be organised around training, Skillnets and things of that nature.  We are, however, a long way away from a situation where companies would be legally obliged to be members of chambers and to contribute to them by supporting training models.  Nonetheless, we have a great deal to learn from countries such as Germany and Austria in the context of how to set up an apprenticeship model in a given area, how to define a curriculum, etc.  There is, of course, no need to reinvent the wheel in many respects because being a process engineer in Ireland is not necessarily any different to being one in Germany or Austria.  If curricula have been defined in particular areas, we can use them.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Brien and others were correct to state that it is going to be important that we make resources available in 2015 and beyond to act as seed capital in the context of the development of apprenticeship.  There will be some resource implications this year from the perspective of personnel being available to support the apprenticeship council with regard to the work it will be obliged to do.  At this stage, I cannot say much more other than to indicate that this will form part of the Department's budgeting arrangements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900007#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Flaherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404910800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Does the Department have even some idea of what needs to be put aside?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900008#H00200","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404910800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>To some extent, what comes back in terms of the proposals will condition some of that.

There is a need to ensure that people who pursue apprenticeships are supported with regard to the type of foundation skills - such as literacy, numeracy, the ability to communicate, etc. - they require.  There must also be clear progression routes, both occupationally, in the context of where one can go in the labour market, and academically, regarding where one can go within the education and training system.  That is going to be important and it will probably have implications in the context of sustainability and how narrowly defined apprenticeships might be.  I refer here to not having apprenticeships that are very narrowly focused in order that those who pursue them will not be left vulnerable.  A key aspect will be that progression opportunities - both laterally and vertically - will be set out.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with some of the points Senator Jim D'Arcy made.  On the apprenticeship charge, I will to some extent give the classic Civil Service answer in that it was a budgetary decision taken by Government in the context of all of the savings the Department needed to make in 2014.  In the context of whether it has acted as a discouragement, we very much hope not.  We hope that people would see the value of apprenticeship and of the training apprentices receive.  A person who pursues an apprenticeship is employed and receives a wage.  He or she also receives an allowance the periods during which he or she is off the job.  That allowance would be a long way north of what would be payable under, for example, a student grant scheme, which is worth bearing in mind.<\/p><p>  The Senator inquired about education and training boards which do not have training centres.  There is an ongoing process in this regard.  Like the Oireachtas, the Department is seized of the need to ensure that this does not become a huge bone of contention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900008#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Flaherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1404910800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>There is so much good to be done in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900008#H00400","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404910800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

There is a diversity of models that must form part of any system that bring us to what is the right answer for society.  We have a very high participation level in higher education and graduate employment levels are back to where they were at pre-crisis levels.  Much of the investment in higher education is paying off but clearly there must be other models and apprenticeship must be a part of that.  There are initiatives such as Springboard, to return to Deputy O'Brien's point about the transferability of skills, under which people are being reskilled and there is a further education and training strategy.  The key question is about the mix and the individual.  The learner must be at the heart of this together with the skills that they need.

Such provision has been somewhat <i>ad hoc<\/i>up to now in that in terms of the overall capital allocation that was available for the Department, there would have been savings and a re-allocation to deal with particular capital needs as well as more larger planned capital developments in further education and training, and in the Cavan-Monaghan area quite a lot has been done.  There is a need to systematise that to a much greater extent and ensure that colleagues in SOLAS have a proper engagement with that process and a full engagement on the capital side because the Department has given them the full current allocation around further education and training, except for some of the teacher pay elements for the PLC colleges.  It is important we have a system in place that allows for the capital element to be included in terms of SOLAS and for that to be properly planned.

In fairness to SOLAS and employers, efforts have been made in that direction even in the traditional sectors in ensuring that when bigger employers such as the ESB took women into apprenticeships that they would do so in twos and threes because it was perceived that it could be quite a difficult work environment and that it would be a more welcoming one if a few were taken on together.  If we expand beyond the existing sectors, that should go some way towards addressing the gender issue.  The point Dr. Peter Rigney made is also important.  When we consider progression to third level and achievement in skills in literacy, numeracy and other areas, girls are outperforming boys fairly decisively.  The area of apprenticeship has been a little bit of a counterweight against that and it is worth taking that into account in any discussion on the issue of general balance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900009#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Flaherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1404911400,"counter":33,"content":"<p>In the context of broadening the opportunities, account must also be taken of people with disabilities.

My view on it, having only been in the area for the past month or two, is that it must be slow and done right.  It should not be a rush job to find ten new ones and get them up and running fairly fast.  The curriculum should be designed to the standards, have the endorsement of employers, employers should be involved in it and it should be appropriate for  the long term.  The numbers involved is also an important factor in terms of whether we will train 100 people or whatever number.  It is better we do it right.  It better to start off and have two or three good apprenticeships a year and after five years there would be 15 rather that trying to run 20 in the first year.  We are up for it and we have started to do some work on it.  We have changed our staffing levels, we are waiting on this to develop and we will be at the centre of it.  It will be a team approach involving not only us in the training centre but those in third level, employers and the stakeholders all working together.

To increase the number of women apprentices it took in each year and we learned a number of things.  First, it is a single process.  One does not get bodies through the door until the results of the CAO process are known.  Second, there were many false perceptions about the regulations.  People said that one had to have technical drawing but one does not.  One has to have either technical drawing or art and as a result of that the potential female constituency was widened.  The perception was that one had to have  to have science, but one had to have a science subject and when domestic science was included the constituency was widened.  If apprenticeships are confined to specific male dominated industries, they will be male dominated, all other things being equal, despite the efforts by employers and despite the bursary system operated by F&Aacute;S-SOLAS.  Therefore, the best way of having a gender balance, which reflects society as whole, is to have a broader range of apprenticeships.<\/p><p>  That said, the issue that does not tend to be stated is that the biggest issue facing the Irish education system is the under-achievement of young males.  That is a major issue and if one does a Google search for Dr. Se&aacute;n McDonagh, the former head of Dundalk Institute of Technology, and what he has written on that, one will find it is an eye-opener.<\/p> <p>We cannot take our eye off that ball.  As we all know, girls mature more rapidly than boys and, frequently, boys of a certain age will not take to being disciplined in a classroom scenario, whereas in work they will frequently accept being informally disciplined with short, monosyllabic words and put in their place.<\/p><p> On the question of sustainability, the group did not go into that in any great detail because it is question of how to regulate for peaks and troughs.  In an ideal world we should have had a way, at the height of the boom, of telling someone they could not become an electrician, a plasterer or a bricklayer because in the long term we do not have the demand for those.  I suggest if we did that the Deputy's clinics would be overflowing with people complaining that their sons could not get a job, and some people mentioned the constitutional right to earn a living.<\/p><p> On the other hand, at the bottom of the boom we have to have the long-term vision to decide, if plasterers are not taken in this year, what can we do to keep the facilities in place.  Plastering is a discipline in which one must stop working before the age of 65 because one's joints begin to give out.  Six years down the line from the slump, where will we get people to build houses a couple of years from now?  Mr. Flaherty would be asking what he should do with all the empty classrooms.  Difficult discussions have to be had about the issue of sustainability, but there are not necessarily any easy answers.<\/p><p> On the question of the German model, the German authorities are asking anyone who will listen in Europe to take on their model.  Fair play to them because they are putting in their money and asking countries like Spain, Slovenia and Slovakia to implement their model.<\/p><p> The most interesting aspect I would bring to members from our deliberations on the committee is that we had one of the most eminent training academics, Professor Hilary Steedman.  Her main piece of advice was, whatever we do, we should not follow the UK model.

One of the big differences is they have been at it for so long.  I attended a conference on apprenticeship in Brussels about a year ago and a British academic suggested that they had been doing this since 1152.  I do not know how they came up with that date but the point is that it has its roots in the medieval guilds.  They also have the institutional arrangements that Mr. Flaherty mentioned - that is, German companies have to be members of business organisations, employer organisations, by law.  If the Deputy wants to suggest that to our legislators I will not have an objection, but we do not have that kind of embedded employer or trade union involvement in our structures in a way that goes back over decades.  What we do have is a responsive education and training system which has a proven track record of working with business, and increasingly so in recent times.  That goes back to the 1970s when the institutes of technology responded to the first wave of ICT companies coming here in a very effective way.<\/p><p>  The review group did not spend too much time considering the binary secondary system they have in Germany, because in practical terms that will not change, and such a change would probably not be desirable.  It is much more to do with parity of esteem, a phrase I have used a few times, in terms of what happens afterwards.  The guidance counsellors in the secondary system and teachers generally have a role to play, but what will sell this model is if people come out with good-quality, sustainable jobs.  If the model works it will speak for itself.  If people coming through this system are outperforming third level graduates - I will come back to Senator D'Arcy's comments on third level - and if it worked properly in the jobs market it would speak for itself.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's final question was on disconnection with further education, as opposed to higher education.  The Skillnets network, albeit a relatively small initiative with an investment of &euro;15 million, is a very good model and is similar to what we are proposing for apprenticeships.  We are not proposing the establishment of a separate organisation but the idea of education and training providers and employers coming together and making a proposal which, if it passed different criteria, would then be funded.  The higher education institutions tend to be more receptive to that.  We could conjecture the reason, but F&Aacute;S was embedded with employers on the training side in regard to level 6 or below.  The further education system has been much more fragmented.  It has worked and responded well in some areas but not so well in others.  That was borne out by the recent review of further education, which, in fairness, sets a blueprint that, if followed, would address the concern I raised and that the Deputy picked up on.<\/p><p>  I echo Deputy O'Brien's comments on funding and the fact that we need to start sooner in terms of seed funding.<\/p><p>  With regard to meeting fluctuating demand and the fact that over 80% of apprenticeships in 2006 were in the construction sector - we saw what happened to that sector and to the apprentices - economies always move in cycles and there will always be changes in demand.  There are two ways of addressing this, the first of which was mentioned by the Deputy, namely, transferable skills, but there is also the idea of plotting progression routes, as he mentioned, out from levels 5 and 6 into higher education and the idea of job clusters.  That is something we have been thinking about internally.  We have been thinking about this in terms of sectors - for example, what would work for the medical devices sector.  However, many of the jobs, whether they are to do with Six Sigma, computer-aided design or quality engineering, are transferable, so perhaps we should start thinking in terms of clusters of jobs.  That is the sort of detail I presume the Apprenticeship Council will get into when it is considering sustainability, but if a quality engineer is employable whether he or she is in medical devices, food, ICT or a range of other sectors, future-proofing it as far as we can in that way is something we could consider.<\/p><p>  Senator D'Arcy's comments were on charges for apprenticeships.  Mr. Flaherty covered that to an extent, particularly with regard to the equality dimension between the third level student in an institute of technology and the apprentice.  The apprentice gets much more State support.  However, the entire area of third level funding needs to be examined, as well as the way in which students are supported.  The Minister announced a review of that last week under the chairmanship of Peter Cassells, and it feeds into this conversation in terms of the idea of student loans, etc.<\/p> <p> An interesting point was raised around tertiary education targets and their legitimacy.  There is no easy answer, except to say it shows the limitations of targets.  What we should remember about the higher education system is that much of it is vocational, which is a potential strength.  This is something that was raised when the committee was discussing the technological university a few weeks ago.  In European countries, particularly in Germany, tertiary education is academic.  It has a strong academic focus, whereas we have a potential strength with some of our universities and institutes of technology where the courses are vocational and have a critical role to play.  If one can plan progression routes and have them transparent and visible, this flexibility that the German system does not have is a potential strength of the Irish system.<\/p><p> The issue of gender balance was raised by Deputies Jonathan O'Brien and Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in.  It has probably been covered in broadening the range.  It is a subject that recurs, particularly in the area of science, technology, engineering and maths, the so-called \"STEM\" subjects, regarding attracting young women into related occupations.  There have been many initiatives and role models.  It is encouraging that the president of Engineers Ireland is a lady.  It is that kind of message that must keep being reinforced.  To go back to my original point, if there are good quality jobs as a result of this initiative, as I genuinely think there can be, it will sell itself to both genders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900010#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404912600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Issues have been raised with me by people who contacted me on the topic.  I revert to the fees issue which was raised by Senator Jim D'Arcy.  One of the recommendations in the Department's summary is that apprentices continue to be paid both on and off the job, with no reduction in earnings during periods spent in education and training institutions.  The payment of fees very much contradict this.  Fees, in effect, represent a cut in the training allowance which is supposed to match what apprentices would receive on the job.  Dr. Rigney might come in on that issue.  What does the ICTU think about the charging of fees for apprentices?<\/p><p>  A model of employer-driven demand for apprentices still seems to be the one recommended in the report.  Should employers drive it?  They may be conservative or vested interests may be an issue.  What is being done to ensure that, ultimately, we will provide the number of apprentices in these areas which will be good for the economy and which will ensure we will have the people with the skills?  Has there been any analysis as part of the reporting process of the number of apprentices we need to enter the trades?

I do not know whether she was a construction worker or an engineer, but the issue of the status of apprenticeships will have a knock-on effect in terms of there being more women entering them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900011#L00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404912600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>On the fees issue, the Chairman is right to identify that the review recommends a continuation of the arrangement whereby apprentices have continuity of income throughout the period of their apprenticeship.  However, I am not sure I agree with the characterisation of the charging of a fee for a service as being, in essence, a reduction in wages.  It might also be worth bearing in mind that the review raises the possibility of employers paying both on and off the job where this might be feasible.  I suspect this might not be a one-size-fits-all solution, but the review went a little further than simply stating the existing arrangement should continue.<\/p><p>  On the employer-led model, I note that the call for proposals is, in some ways, a move - at least in the initial stages - in the direction of testing proposals against demand forecasting.  There is a very sophisticated set of employment forecasting resources in SOLAS which has a strategic labour market unit.  The unit produces occupational forecasts on a regular basis which informs the work of the expert group on future skills needs.  In considering proposals for new apprenticeships regard will be had to where the growth and the demand are likely to occur.  It is very difficult.  Dr. Rigney hit the nail on the head when he said it was a difficult issue in terms of existing apprenticeships.  The beautiful thing about it is that it is super sensitive to the level of demand in the economy in so far as the route into apprenticeship is to find a job.  When one has a job, the State guarantees that it will row in behind it in terms of education and training.  However, this has led to some of the difficulties around peaks and troughs and apprentices being made redundant.  Some possible solutions have been discussed, but it is difficult to say - this is recommended in the report - in the early stages of implementation that after the 100th electrician, we are going to say to the 101st, \"Sorry, we will not train you.\"  It is one thing when one is planning a new apprenticeship from the ground up, but it is very challenging in terms of the existing trades and needs to be examined.  It raises all sorts of issue around equity.  The throwaway example of the 101st electrician is, probably, not valid.  One would have to do it by calling on employers to state how many apprentices they wanted.  It would be a radical shift away from where we are in the existing trades.  It runs in the opposite direction to some of the employer-led recommendations made in the report.<\/p><p>  I may leave it to Mr. Rowan to say what is likely to come up in the short term.  Mr. Donohoe might have a view also.  There have been a number of approaches to the Department and SOLAS from interested groups at the early stages.  Dr. Rigney referred to the demise of CERT and the groups have included people in the hospitality and tourism sectors and those at intermediate ICT skills levels.

They make the case - in my view, quite persuasively - that apprentices are being charged fees which are allegedly for student services, despite the fact that for the majority of their short time in college they are not in a position to avail of those services and, additionally, they are paying PAYE and PRSI, so they are making their contribution to society in a different way.<br \/>As regards potential for further apprenticeship designation, while that will emerge, it is important to remember that traditionally in apprenticeship - solicitor apprenticeship is a classic case - apprentices accept a low wage for a period of time in training to progress to a higher wage.  Hospitality is traditionally a low-wage sector.  If one looks at the Galway city edition of <i>The Connacht Tribune<\/i>for the week before last, the local head of the Irish Hotels Federation stated that people will not work in their sector even though they pay the third highest minimum wage in western Europe.  Regardless of the rate of the minimum wage, apprentices will not accept low pay for a period of time in order to then work for the minimum wage.  This has to be sold to the mammies of Ireland who sit beside their offspring when they are making out CAO forms.  That is the situation.<br \/>The other matter about the German model is that Irish society has bought into the idea of a leaving certificate that will qualify a person for everything.  In an ideal world it might be great to have the German dual system and say that one must make a choice at the age of 15 or 16 years, but I do not think Irish society will accept that.  Irish society, as I stated, has bought into the idea that everyone does the leaving certificate.  That is a societal value that we hold.  It may be wrong from the point of view of the sociologist, but it is the value that we as a society hold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900012#M00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney"},{"type":"speech","time":1404913200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>My understanding is this review states that the minimum period would be two years.

It was not a recommendation that there be a reduction to two years.<br \/>The point with regard to duration - this speaks to the review of the curriculum and the existing apprenticeships - is that it must be led by the learning outcomes that are required in order to undertake the occupation.  It depends on how complex they are, how long it takes to embed those skills, and how long one needs to spend on the job and off the job.  That is the key determinant of how long an apprenticeship would be.  Because the group adopted a view of apprenticeship as being deep, sustained and leading to autonomous and competent workers, it recommended that the period should not fall below two years, but that is very much a floor, not a target.<br \/>On the short versus longer block release, without getting too technical about this, the annual student contribution is currently &euro;2,500.  That is what one pays.  It is increasing to &euro;2,750 for 2014-15.  Typically, apprentices are taken in in three 10- or 11-week blocks during the year, which roughly equate to the three academic terms, and they pay one third of that figure.  Therefore, it is <i>pro rata<\/i>.  As the Chairman correctly stated, there are some apprenticeships which involve longer periods in the institutions - for example, for those studying electrical instrumentation on aircraft, where the blocks are longer.  In those cases, the <i>pro rata<\/i>fee is different.  If their block release is longer, they pay more.  It is a greater percentage of the annual amount.  That is probably not welcomed by those apprentices, but it is equitable insofar as it is based on how long one spends in the institution.<br \/>On the question of consultation with the institutes of technology-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014070900012#M01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil Flaherty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404913200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Sorry; I would like to pick up on the last point.

Mr. Phil Flaherty made the point that this was a floor, not a target.  This is a floor and we were very mindful of differentiating between apprenticeships, internships, traineeships and all the other work-based learning models.  We also felt it should be tied to the learning outcomes.  No disrespect to tilers, for example, but the current apprenticeship period for a tiler is four years, the same period applicable to people who are doing aircraft maintenance.  Clearly, that is not an efficient use of time or resources.<\/p><p>  Let me pick up on the point as to whether the enterprise-led model is a good one and whether there is innate conservatism.  I do not believe there is because I cannot think of any other model that would work.  Labour market forecasting is a relatively inexact science.  We have very good forecasters in this State but one needs the intelligence that businesses bring.  In the consultation informing the work of the review group, we asked our members what would get them to the table on apprenticeships because we have to sell the idea to them.  Three points arose.  First, and most important, was that there has to be a genuine demand.  It does not matter how much the State is prepared to support apprenticeships if there is not a skills demand.  Without this, employers will not get involved.  Second, there has to be a genuine influence on the occupations and occupational standards, rather than the details of pedagogy and curriculum design.  The latter are quite rightly the remit of the education and training providers.  There should be at least some influence on the occupational standards, particularly.  Third was the possibility of State support for the training and education elements.  Those three boxes have to be ticked before a company will engage.<\/p><p>  There are a number of sectors to be considered, and some have been suggested.  I agree that there are great opportunities in hospitality, retail, advanced manufacturing, ICT, etc., but they will be realised only through the process we have suggested, which has the virtue of being flexible.  If the demand does not exist and the proposals are not thought through properly, they will not receive support.  That is the beauty of this model.  It has to be underpinned by all the other agencies of the State in terms of quality assurance, qualifications, accreditation and matters pertaining to the State providers.

I would like to set out the background to the amendments and what is proposed.<\/p><p>  As Members will know, the Bill as published made it unlawful for a person, other than a licensed operator, to act as a bookmaker and the Minister for Justice was tasked with compliance regarding remote operators.  The Bill provides that, where an unlicensed remote operator engages with punters in this jurisdiction, the Minister for justice will issue a notice to that individual or company to cease activity.<\/p> <p>The Bill, as published, also provided that the Minister for justice may apply to the District Court for an order directing service providers, including financial institutions, advertisers and Internet service providers, not to provide services to specified unlicensed operators.  In addition, it also provided for the revoking of a licence and the issue of similar court orders in these circumstances.<\/p><p> The amendments that are now before the House provide for the temporary assignment of responsibility for enforcement against unlicensed remote operators from the Minister for justice to the Revenue Commissioners - the key point, pending the establishment of the gambling regulator under the proposed gambling control legislation.  This means that Revenue will be responsible for bringing summary prosecutions against unlicensed bookmakers and remote operators.  In this context, Revenue will operate a new model for enforcing compliance by unlicensed remote operators.  The model will operate as follows: where an unlicensed operator is accepting bets from within the State, Revenue will issue a notice to that operator of the need to become properly licensed or cease to provide betting services in the State; and should an operator contravene a requirement of this notice, the operator will have committed an offence and will be liable to penalties.<\/p><p> Given the practical considerations associated with prosecuting unlicensed operators outside the State, the compliance model will also enable Revenue to take effective action to prevent unlicensed operators carrying on business in the State.  The Bill, as amended, prohibits Internet service providers, advertisers or persons promoting products, from providing services in the State to unlicensed remote operators.  Revenue may issue compliance notices.  The Internet service providers may appeal a compliance notice to the District Court which will either affirm or direct Revenue to withdraw the notice.  A person who fails to comply with such a notice by the specified date shall be guilty of an offence.  It is proposed to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage, or if this does not prove possible, when the Bill is in the Seanad to specify the penalties that will apply.<\/p><p> Because of the complex way the international debit and credit card payment system works, the most effective way of preventing unlicensed operators receiving payment from consumers in the State is to work with the international payment service industry.  In an approach similar to that taken in the United Kingdom, Revenue proposes to enter into voluntary arrangements under which the international payment service providers will take action to prevent operators using their payment systems to carry out illegal betting.  The Irish Banking Federation and the Irish payment service operators have indicated their commitment, in principle, to concluding an arrangement with Revenue for this purpose.<\/p><p> Action to prevent Internet access by Irish consumer to unlicensed operators and to prevent unlicensed operators using credit card payment systems for accepting payment provide effective tools for enforcing compliance by remote operators carrying on business in the State.  We believe that the main operators in the Irish market will comply with the law and will welcome the opportunity to become licensed so that they can continue to do business here.  Operators who do not wish to become licensed in Ireland can voluntarily block communications and transactions with Irish consumers and most are expected to do so to avoid Revenue enforcement action, which would also risk reputational damage to the operator in the eyes of gambling regulators elsewhere.  Illicit operators on the margins of the market are unlikely to attract a high level of business from Irish consumers in view of the perceived risk that they will fail to pay out.<\/p><p> The compliance model proposed provides the most practical and effective approach given the inherent difficulties in dealing with persons operating largely outside the State.

A &quot;Prime Time&quot; special on this issue some time ago showed that minors are able to place bets in bookies' shops.

The Bill, as published, provides that &quot;the Minister for Justice and Equality may revoke a certificate of personal fitness ....  where he is satisfied that .... the holder of the certificate is not a fit and proper person to hold a bookmaker&rsquo;s licence, a remote bookmaker&rsquo;s licence or a remote betting intermediary&rsquo;s licence&quot;.

I believe that if one wishes to place a bet, one should have the money on one, or one should have access to a debit card.  I have raised this issue with the Department and the Minister.  I put it to the Minister of State that the problem of gambling addiction, which is well documented and not easily overcome, has been exacerbated by the easing of access to credit cards.  I remind him that many people have publicly announced the level of debt they have accumulated.  I suggest that if we were to restrict these transactions to debit cards, nobody could use a credit card to bet money he or she does not have.  I do not think there is a bookmaker out there who would offer credit on these terms, so why should a financial institution facilitate somebody going into hock or debt for the purposes of a fun activity?  An enormous level of debt can mount up as a result of this addiction.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on that, if possible.

Other sporting organisations could benefit from this funding too rather than 100% of any bet placed on any sporting event going to the horse and greyhound fund.<\/p> <p>Although the Department of Finance always says it cannot ring-fence money for anything, not mental health or suicide prevention, legislation was passed in 2001 to achieve this for the horse and greyhound fund.  Can we ensure the receipts from this new levy will not be ring-fenced for the same fund and can we have an assurance that a different arrangement will be in place?  It is highly questionable that the arrangement will still be in place for this, underpinned by the legislation.  Unless it is amended or repealed, there is little we can do.  I am anxious for the Minister to clarify that receipts from the fund would not be ring-fenced for the horse and greyhound fund and that we would have an understanding that the funding mechanism would, perhaps, be reviewed in the future because the legislation was passed in 2001 and we live in very different times.

While I commend the officials on bringing forward a Bill that has not been heavily amended, they have had probably the longest period of time of any Bill I have seen.  Notwithstanding the issues regarding having Commission approval, it is disappointing that we have lost tens of millions of euro of revenue because of the delay in the introduction of this charge on online gambling over the past number of years.  The Finance Bill of 2009 increased the levy to 2% but it was never enacted by the then Minister, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan.  This goes back a long way.<\/p><p>  The levy must be increased.  The former Minister of State, now MEP, former Deputy Brian Hayes, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, have said we must get it across the line and then examine an increase in the levy.  While it is expected that the levy will be increased, the fact that the Bill has been delayed for so long suggests that we should increase the levy now.  The State badly needs the revenue.  No matter when we bring in the &euro;20 million from online gambling, the horse and greyhound fund will still need to be supplemented by Exchequer funding if it is to remain at its current level, and that sticks in my craw, particularly as cuts in different areas are announced.  Although last year we examined discretionary medical cards, the Government passed a motion to put money into the horse and greyhound fund.  While the industry has an economic benefit for the State, the fund goes to the winners of races in the State, and a large amount goes to certain stables, which is very difficult to swallow.<\/p> <p>I am familiar with the economic benefits of the horse racing industry in the State.  While my amendment has been ruled out of order, when the Bill comes before the D&aacute;il in September and then goes to the Seanad, it should include an increase in the levy.  Alternatively it should be addressed a few weeks later when the budget goes through.  The Minister should signal his intention.<\/p><p> Are we missing a trick here?  I ask the Minister of State and his officials to correct me if I am wrong.  We are dealing with the taxing of online gambling.  If I go onto the Paddy Power website and place a bet on a horse or a football match, the turnover will be taxed.  However, if I go onto the Paddy Power website and play blackjack, the turnover the company makes on that is not taxed.  Is that correct?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070900007#O04500","speaker":"959","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404927900,"counter":229,"content":"<p>There is no betting duty on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070900008#P00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1404927900,"counter":230,"content":"<p>We are discussing the Betting (Amendment) Bill.  If we look at online gambling, sport represents a small proportion of the overall book; it is what attracts people in.  The heavy money is spent on the roulette tables, the poker tables, Texas hold 'em and other such games.  None of that is taxed in this country.  We are taxing online gambling for the first time but we are only taxing a small part of online gambling.  There is obviously difficulty with a turnover tax on some of the other forms, including roulette, Texas hold 'em, poker and blackjack.  However, we can and should develop a profits tax for this.  We need to move into the realm of profits, which would not be a major draw on the Exchequer.  I am informed that approximately 93% of all turnover is paid out again so we would be basically taxing the same thing.  By doing that, it is easier to tax the other books which would be more lucrative for the State.<\/p><p>  I like to gamble the odd time on all of these types of books, but this is taxing a vice.  It is probably the only thing left in the State that is not taxed appropriately.  I am talking about online activity.  I do not believe people will be turned off if there were a 3% profits tax on a bet.  People will not be turned off over paying 30 cent on winnings of a tenner and if they are, they can afford it because they choose to do this; they do not have to do this.  We can consider the things we have taxed in the past such as fuel to heat people's homes or to get to work in a car, or basics such putting a shirt on one's back or food on the table.  This is an area where we should look at the rate.  Overall we should consider whether we are really taxing gambling.<\/p><p>  I have talked about online gambling, but there is another area of gambling.  We can walk into any casino in Dublin tonight and there is no duty or tax.  I accept there is tax on the profits of the company and so forth, but there is no duty.  We are identifying one wee area and it took us a long time to close this area down in terms of online sports betting, but there are whole other areas we have just left out.  As we struggle to balance the books in the State we should focus on this area.  I encourage the Government to go down this route.  Moving from a turnover tax to a profit tax is a way to capture those books and also to have a rate that ensures the industry is sustainable.  It would bring in sufficient revenue to the State to fund the horse and greyhound racing fund and also to cover other areas such as gambling addiction and other areas that badly need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070900008#P00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1404927900,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty who made a number of good points that need to be followed up on at a time when all the sporting bodies in the country are crying out for money.

On the other hand we know of the negative consequences of people developing an unhealthy relationship with gambling.  To my mind it makes perfect sense to increase the revenue yield from this source.  I believe it makes much more sense to tax winnings than to tax turnover.  If I won &euro;1,000 on a bet, I would not have any problem paying &euro;20 or &euro;30 to the State by way of a tax.<\/p><p>  There is also the issue of not capturing what is essentially online gambling.

If we were to increase the rate to 3% and without changing anything else, high street bookies would be put out of business overnight.  High street bookies are going out of business overnight for other reasons, such as people moving to using mobile phones and so forth.  However, there will be a certain level at which that will plateau and we are probably reaching it at this point.  The betting duty is putting high street bookies out of business.<\/p><p>  The rate needs to move to 3% and placed on the punter.  At the moment the shop or company absorbs the 1%.  If it were increased to 1.5% or 2% the likelihood is that the larger organisations could absorb that until they wiped out the high street bookies and then possibly they would pass it on to their customers.  It has to be of a sufficient scale but not inappropriate to gamblers.  I believe companies will not be able to absorb 3% and it would be passed on.  It could also be done legislatively.  If the Government did that overnight, it would save jobs.<\/p><p>  I have looked at the audited accounts of some high street bookies and they have showed me the margins they are making.  They have closed down shops in the past and they are closing down more.  They are in debt to the Revenue and in arrangements with the Revenue because they cannot pay this.  However, this should be passed on to the customer.  Gambling is a vice and if I am gambling, I should know that I am paying the tax.  I am not suggesting that we impose a 3% tax and leave it as it is with it being absorbed by the industry, because it cannot be absorbed.  We should go back to how it used to be where it was passed on to the customer.  The best way of doing that is by applying it to winnings because nobody minds having a deduction from their winnings, although some people might mind.  However, it is like \"take it or leave it\" at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014070900008#P00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1404927900,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Our former colleagues, Mr. Brendan McGahon and Mr. Charlie McCreevy, made the argument in the past about doing away with betting tax.

The fact this is illegal led me to examine this section of the Bill.  The point of the correspondence was not that I should report the Taoiseach for involvement in illegal activity in a Paddy Power shop or the journalist or shop owner who may have breached the law when the photograph was printed.  The point was instead the archaic laws which exist for this sector.  A number of bookie accounts in my Twitter account are giving odds of 10\/1 for Argentina to win the soccer match tonight and that type of advertising is illegal in this country.  Anybody publicising odds outside a premises, whether in the newspaper or anywhere else, is breaking the law as it stands, and any citizen can report this to the Garda.  That is why this element of the law should be repealed.<\/p><p>  Paddy Power had an advertisement related to the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius trial, and in my view and that of many others it was deeply distasteful to say the least.  The company is involved in innovative ways to advertise its product and some of the advertisements step over the mark, while others are just clever and cheeky.  The advertisement to which I refer stepped over the mark.  Nevertheless, there is nothing to prohibit any company taking out an advertisement in a national newspaper outlining odds on whether a person will be found guilty of murder, although there is a law against a local bookmaker publishing in the same newspaper odds for \"Bodyke Celtic\" playing \"High Street United\" in a local derby.  That does not make sense.<\/p><p>  This amendment seeks to repeal the section.  We should be dealing with a gambling control Bill, and I hope it will tackle this issue.

It is still gambling even though they use nice advertisements and all the rest.  A person can go into a shop, mark numbers on a lotto slip and hand it over with his or her money to a shop assistant which is probably less addictive, in my view and without a scientific background, than the very addictive scratch cards which are part of the national lottery.  I have seen how addictive scratch cards can be with my own eyes and seen people really hopeful that they will win the next big prize.

The failure of any firm which impacts on Irish consumers, policyholders or claimants is a matter of serious concern for the Central Bank.  Policyholders buy insurance to protect themselves against future risks and therefore they should be able to rely on the cover for which they have paid.  Safeguarding consumers is one of the Central Bank&rsquo;s primary objectives, and with this in mind, the actions which the Central Bank has taken in regard to Setanta have been with the aim of protecting the interests of Irish consumers.<\/p><p>  I will give a brief overview of what the Central Bank&rsquo;s role has been in regard to Setanta.  Setanta is a company which was established in Malta in 2007 and was authorised and supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority, MFSA.  Setanta sold insurance in Ireland on a freedom of services basis, that is, it was entitled to sell here once it had obtained authorisation from the MFSA under the provisions of the Single Market directives.  The firm did not operate on a branch basis in Ireland.  It did, however, have an administrative office in Blanchardstown.  Setanta was required to comply with conduct of business requirements of the Central Bank when selling to Irish consumers.  Setanta provided private and commercial motor insurance policies to Irish consumers and sold exclusively through approximately 230 brokers.  At the time it went into liquidation, Setanta had approximately 75,000 policyholders, two thirds of which were commercial motor insurance policies and one third of which were private motor insurance policies.<\/p><p>  In January 2014 the MFSA directed Setanta to cease carrying on the business of insurance, including the renewal of existing business.  On 16 April 2014 Setanta handed back its licence to the MFSA and on 17 April the firm announced that it was commencing a creditors' voluntary liquidation as it was unable to meet its outstanding claims in full.  A creditors' meeting was held on 30 April 2014 in Malta at which a liquidator was appointed to administer the liquidation of Setanta.  All policies were cancelled by the liquidator with effect from 29 May 2014.<\/p><p>  In early September 2013 the Central Bank became concerned about the financial position of Setanta based on market intelligence, and as a result, contacted the MFSA, on a regulator to regulator basis, seeking confirmation that Setanta was solvent and that it had sufficient assets to meets its liabilities to Irish policyholders.  The MFSA confirmed that it received monthly management accounts and solvency calculations and, according to its latest management accounts, Setanta was meeting the relevant solvency requirements in terms of the EU solvency I directive.<\/p><p>  In October 2013 the Central Bank conducted an inspection of Setanta to examine its practices in regard to claims handling.  In November 2013 the Central Bank met Setanta to discuss the findings of the inspection, including our concerns about how the company was reserving for its claims.  The Central Bank also contacted the MFSA to share our findings and a copy of our inspection report was forwarded to the MFSA requesting that it take appropriate action.  Due to our ongoing concerns for Irish policyholders, the Central Bank continued to engage very closely with the MFSA following the submission of the report to it.  In January 2014 the Central Bank received further market intelligence which raised further concerns.  We again raised these with the MFSA.  We also wrote to the Department of Finance outlining our concerns in regard to Setanta and advised it of the possibility of a potential call on the insurance compensation fund in the event of failure of this firm.<\/p><p>  Following receipt of the Central Bank&rsquo;s report on the findings of the inspection, the MFSA appointed a liability loss adjuster firm in December 2013 to carry out an independent assessment of Setanta&rsquo;s outstanding loss reserves.  On 16 January 2014 the MFSA notified the Central Bank that it had received initial indications from the liability loss adjuster that there was a material shortfall in Setanta&rsquo;s reserves.  Based on the final report received, and its knowledge of Setanta as its prudential regulator, the MFSA directed Setanta to cease writing new business and issuing renewals with effect from the close of business on 24 January 2014 and a Maltese firm was appointed to manage an orderly run-off.<\/p><p>  On 27 January 2014 Setanta issued a letter to its entire broker network to inform them of the MFSA&rsquo;s direction to cease writing new business and issuing further renewals with effect from the close of business on 24 January 2014.  Setanta also requested that the brokers issue a letter to the policyholders that provided information about the MFSA&rsquo;s direction.  Following the issuing of the direction, the MFSA continued to engage with Setanta in an attempt to resolve its financial difficulties and ultimately informed the Central Bank on 11 April that Setanta had failed to secure a resolution to its solvency deficit and that the directors were going to propose a voluntary liquidation to its shareholders.  On 16 April 2014 the MFSA informed the Central Bank that Setanta had handed back its licence after the shareholders resolved to wind it up.<\/p><p>  The Central Bank published a notice on its website on 17 April informing the public and the media about the liquidation of Setanta and that policyholders should make arrangements to obtain alternative cover without delay.  This notice has been updated as new developments occurred.  At the same time, Setanta notified its broker network that a solvent run-off of the business was no longer possible and that this information should be brought to the attention of policyholders.  The Central Bank also communicated directly with the brokers and we instructed them to contact policyholders regarding making alternative insurance arrangements and to offer to assist them to obtain proof of no-claims bonus.<\/p> <p>We also engaged with the representative bodies of the brokers, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, PIBA and the Irish Brokers Association, IBA, as well as Insurance Ireland, to help facilitate policyholders transfer to another insurer.  The Central Bank also provided advice to policyholders who contacted us, as well as providing information to the National Consumer Agency.<br \/>Currently, the liquidator is in the process of assessing the level of potential claims and the assets and liabilities of Setanta in order to estimate the actual shortfall.  This process could take some time, particularly as some claims may not as yet have been submitted, and also some claims may be ongoing for some considerable time.<br \/>Policyholders or third party claimants who have not yet submitted their claim to the liquidator should do so as soon as possible.  This will ensure the claimant will be included as a creditor of Setanta when its liabilities are being assessed.  Our understanding is that premium refunds are automatically included on the creditors list.<br \/>The failure of Setanta has clearly impacted on all its policyholders.  While the Central Bank&rsquo;s supervision of Setanta extends to conduct of business issues only, we have sought to protect the interests of Irish policyholders through engagement with the Malta Financial Services Authority, MFSA, the firm and the liquidator.  We will continue to ensure affected consumers are fully informed of any developments and to<font color=\"#FF0000\"><\/font>liaise with the MFSA during the liquidation process.  I thank the members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014070900003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Sheridan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404911700,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to brief it on the collapse of Setanta Insurance and, in particular, to provide members with information on the role and operation of the insurance compensation fund, ICF, and how this fund may be used to assist those policyholders affected by the closure of Setanta.<br \/>The fund was established under the Insurance Act 1964 to make arrangements to meet certain liabilities of insolvent insurers, provide for the Minister to make advances to the fund, and provide for contributions to the fund by insurers.  The fund is maintained and administered under the control of the President of the High Court.  Amounts are paid from the fund, with the approval of the High Court, to a person in regard to an insurer in liquidation or administration, in respect of claims under policies issued by the insolvent insurer in circumstances where it is unlikely that the claims can be met otherwise than from the fund.  The Accountant of the High Court provides annual accounts of the fund to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, and these are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the period since the early 1980s, the fund has advanced moneys to Primor plc, formerly PMPA Insurance Company, Icarom plc, formerly Insurance Corporation of Ireland, and since 2011, QIL, Quinn Insurance Limited.  Currently, there is a balance of &euro;48 million in the fund.<br \/>In accordance with section 5 of the 1964 Act, in the event that the fund does not have sufficient funds to meet a payment approved by the High Court, the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Central Bank, advance Central Fund moneys to the fund to enable payments out of the fund to be made promptly, and on the terms and conditions he decides to be appropriate.  The fund is, ultimately, funded by contributions from insurers.  Prior to 2011, the Act provided for charges to be levied on insurers in respect of policies issued regardless of the location of the insured risks.  Following advice from the Attorney General that charges could not be levied on insurance companies in respect of risks outside the State, an amendment was made to the 1964 Act through the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011.  The amendment Act provides that the fund shall be funded by contributions from insurers who issue policies in respect of risks in the State, whether the insurers are based in Ireland or in another member state, and it changed the scope of the fund from one that covers the risks of policyholders of Irish authorised insurance companies to one which covers all insured risk in the State, except for specific excluded risks.<br \/>Under the Act, the Central Bank has responsibility for determining whether the fund requires financial support and the level of contribution to be paid to the fund by insurers.  The contribution may not exceed 2% of aggregate of the gross premiums paid to each insurer for policies issued in respect of risks in the State.  A levy in accordance with section 6 of the Act, as substituted by section 7 of the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011, came into effect on 1 January 2012.  The Central Bank set the levy at a maximum 2% of aggregate of the gross premiums paid.  The Department of Finance estimates that the levy will generate approximately &euro;65 million per annum.  In 2013, the levy generated &euro;64.6 million.  The levy is payable quarterly in arrears to the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for its collection, and they transfer the proceeds of the levy to the ICF account.<br \/>The committee will be aware that the liquidation of an insurance company is a legally complex and time-consuming process.  In general terms, under the Statute of Limitations, claimants are given two years following an accident to make an initial claim.  However, it could take several years for a particular case to be settled. Protracted legal challenges also add years, and often additional costs, to the claims process.  These are factors that the liquidator is currently examining to get an estimate of the cost of claims in the Setanta liquidation.<br \/>Committee members will be aware that the liquidation of Setanta Insurance is still at an early stage.  The liquidator has advised us that claims and amounts incurred but not reported are likely to be considerably greater than in the statement of affairs as prepared by the directors at the time of liquidation.  The liquidator has appointed Towers Watson to conduct an assessment of the adequacy of the claims reserves quoted in the statement of affairs.  To date, he has only received preliminary information from Towers Watson on claims and incurred but not reported reserve amounts as part of a detailed examination of the insurance claims against the company.  The liquidator has emphasised that any information on claims is subject to change as more information is received and this may have a material impact on the overall estimate of the likely maximum dividend that will be payable from the liquidation.<br \/>On the way claims may be paid out, the main factors relating to the ICF payment of claims as set out in the ICF legislation is as follows.  First, a payment may only be made if it appears unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the fund.  This means that it is necessary to clarify how much is available from the liquidator to go towards the claim and whether the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, is in a position to pay the claim or a portion of the claim.  Second, the ICF only pays out on claims where an individual is involved.<b><\/b>The Act provides that claims by bodies corporate or unincorporated bodies are not covered by the fund except where there is a liability to or by an individual.  While the liquidator has informed us that Setanta had a significant number of commercial policies, he is not in a position to clarify the exact amount at this stage.  He has indicated that:<blockquote>It doesn't necessarily follow that most claims would not be covered by the Fund.  While we have not detailed breakdowns, we expect that the majority of claims will relate to liability to individuals and would therefore be covered.<\/blockquote>Third, in a liquidation situation, the ICF only pays out 65% of the total claim or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  Fourth, the ICF does not refund unearned premiums.<br \/>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland is a non-profit-making organisation registered in Ireland, which was established by agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland, in accordance with the EU motor insurance directives.  All insurance companies underwriting motor insurance in this country must, by law, be members of the MIBI and contribute to funding claims in proportion to their market share.  The principal role of the MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  This is regulated under the terms of a 2009 agreement between the MIBI and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<br \/>The MIBI does not operate a fund.  Claims are received and issued to one of four major insurers which handle the claims on behalf of the MIBI.  When claims are settled, MIBI member motor insurance companies are levied to make up the amount due.  This means that the MIBI is funded entirely by premiums paid by insured policyholders and it has a responsibility to ensure all its payments are appropriate and fair.<br \/>The arrangements put in place by the MIBI for dealing with the Setanta claims is a matter for the MIBI itself under the terms of the agreement and, as such, it falls outside the remit of the Minister for Finance to issue instructions to the MIBI.  The situation of Setanta Insurance, where an insurance company has gone into liquidation, is believed to be unprecedented.  Given this fact and its potential impact, the MIBI is taking legal advice as regards its role and responsibilities.  The MIBI board will meet in the coming days after which further clarifications are expected relating to that legal advice and its outcome.<br \/>The question as to how the ICF can assist those policyholders affected by the Setanta closure, the role of the MIBI and the work of the liquidator continues to be examined by the Department.<\/p> <p>The process to be followed and the formal procedures for making applications will be set out once clarification is reached on a number of issues.  It goes without saying that payments made by the relevant parties must be entirely in compliance with laws and agreements under which they operate.  In the case of Setanta, it is necessary for all the parties to obtain clarity on the legal position.  Furthermore, for the liquidator, each case is subject the terms of the individual insurance policy itself.<\/p><p> According to section 3B of the 1964 Act, as amended, where a person who performs the functions of a liquidator has been appointed to an insolvent insurer in another member state, the Accountant to the High Court may apply to the High Court for approval for amounts due to claimants, subject to the limitations set out in the legislation.  The office of the High Court Accountant will liaise with the Central Bank of Ireland and the Department of Finance on the state of the insurance compensation fund, ICF, and its ability to meet claims.  The ICF is expected to be adequately funded to meet all claims but the Minister for Finance may advance moneys to the ICF to meet any shortfall, if necessary.<\/p><p> Members will be aware of the Minister's strong desire that matters relating to the liquidation of Setanta be progressed and concluded in an orderly fashion.  This is important for the claimants as well as former policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  It also is important for the insurance sector as a whole.  In summary, Setanta claimants should continue to contact the liquidator regarding their claims until otherwise advised.  The liquidator is continuing his work on providing clarity to the extent he can on the full extent of claims and the likely dividend from the liquidation.  Once further information becomes available and the outcome of the consideration by the MIBI of its legal advice has been taken into account, the Department will further examine how the ICF can assist those policyholders affected by the Setanta closure.  The Department and the Central Bank continue to work with the liquidator to assist in that regard.  I am happy to take any questions or clarifications to assist the joint committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014070900004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Casey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404912300,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pat Casey and Mr. the Bernard Sheridan.

This firm branded itself as an Irish company deliberately to operate in the Irish market, but those Irish customers and people living in the State discovered afterwards that it was not an Irish company and that they were not protected within the same regulatory framework as if they had been insured by an Irish company.

It also must comply with the minimum standards.  These minimum standards will be changed within the next year and a half, when the provisions of solvency II come in and these standards will be raised.  At present, however, once a company is complying with the minimum standards set at EU level, it is entitled to operate anywhere throughout the EU market.  As to whether there is another Setanta out there, I am unsure whether it is dependent on whether it is in Malta or any other country.

The insurance industry is regulated at European Union level and the issue then is to what degree the safety net is there if there is a failure of an insurance company.  There is not yet a harmonised approach with regard to the safety net.  There are proposals to have a European-wide insurance compensation or protection scheme but it still is at fairly early stages and has not been developed as a proposal.  In Ireland, we have the insurance compensation fund and the legislation surrounding it as a safety net.  However, a number of restrictions are in place in that regard because of the cost of having in place a complete safety net.  For us, the insurance compensation fund is there to protect policyholders in the event that an insurance company becomes insolvent and, consequently, is there at that level of protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014070900005#E01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1404912300,"counter":312,"content":"<p>Let us say, for example, that I approached a broker in the morning, as I assume most people who took out Setanta insurance got it through a brokerage.

In the case of the latter, one will fall a lot further before one hits that safety net, given the area of regulation.  Could a requirement be placed on the industry in this country - as something over which the State could have control as opposed to waiting for European regulation on harmonisation to happen -  that a broker would inform a potential customer that the proposed safety net was different?

One is trying to ensure one is getting the same deal at a cheaper price.  However, were someone offering me a cheaper price with a different safety net, that would have me going back to the original quotation.

It appears from reading the witnesses' opening remarks that the 75,000 customers directly affected are pretty much left high and dry and that those who do not have a claim are out of pocket for the remainder of the year for which they paid for their policy.  They have had to take out new insurance policies, which is a major issue for many people as money is very scarce.  For those who have claims, it appears to me that they are left high and dry because they have to wait until the liquidation process advances and becomes much clearer.

It seems that the only flag that was raised for consumers came in the form of the widely-circulated press release.  On numerous occasions we asked the Minister what he was doing to ensure that customers would not be at a loss as a result of the decision taken in January.  It does not appear that the Central Bank took any serious action to protect customers from having their policies renewed by an institution which the Malta financial services authority had directed to stop renewing them.  Was the Central Bank aware of the fact that policies were being renewed after the 24 January cut-off point?  What action is it taking in respect of the renewal of those policies?  Is the Central Bank of the view that it was appropriate that the policies in question were renewed?  The Irish Brokers Association has referred to a statutory instrument and stated that its members issue renewal notices prior to renewal dates.  This means that if a notice was issued on 23 January last and even though it had been informed that it could not do so from the following day, Setanta still renewed the relevant policy five weeks and six days later.  That is what happened to many people who renewed their policies and paid their premiums in full.  Those people subsequently were without insurance cover, which means that they lost out on the double.

Under the current regime, the first thing a company has to do is prudently estimate how much money and resources it will need to meet its liabilities on an expected basis, so it takes a prudent approach to what is expected to happen and it sets aside resources to meet that.  We spoke earlier about the inspection we carried out in October and into November, in which we looked at the claims files.  What we noticed on the claims files was that what the claims team was estimating as the amount it might need for the claim seemed low.  That is what we meant when we said earlier that one cannot extrapolate from that into anything else.  How much is held in terms of reserves really depends on a company's prudential assessment of what it thinks its liabilities are going to be.  The solvency margin is then a measure of freely available assets it must maintain over and above that to act as a buffer against unexpected shocks.  If I follow the Deputy's reasoning correctly, one cannot extrapolate from the number of policyholders necessarily or the quantum of reserves that are shown in the statement of affairs as to what the prudential level of reserving should be, because that is something that only the prudential supervisor and the company itself could do with all of the financial information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014070900013#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Kincaid"},{"type":"speech","time":1404916800,"counter":529,"content":"<p>That is what I am asking.

Some 75,000 policyholders have been shafted.  Many of them are small and medium enterprises and many are individuals.  Somebody has failed to see this coming.  If this discussion is to mean anything, we need to learn lessons.  It strikes me that the dogs on the street could have worked out that there was something wrong with a company if it was licensed in Malta although its shareholders were primarily Irish, it was selling exclusively to the Irish market, its main staff operations were in Ireland and, through its name, it packaged itself as Irish.  That is fishy straightaway as far as I am concerned.  I cannot believe somebody in the Central Bank did not figure out much earlier that it was fishy.  Why the hell would a company do that?  There has to be some scam at play.  It is trying to evade regulation, taxation, or both.  Surely that is obvious.  It is absolutely terrifying that the delegates tell me this is happening all over the place in Europe.  There are companies based in Ireland that do not do any business in Ireland.  Why are they here?  What is the reason for their being here?  There are companies selling insurance mainly in Ireland, such as Setanta, that are not licensed here.<\/p><p>  I had an inquiry from the manager of my son's football team asking why there is such a radical difference between motor insurance premiums offered by various insurance companies.  There are staggering differences, yet the underwriters of the insurance are the same people.  Therefore, there is something fishy going on.

This is about the mess we are in.  It is a mess one way or another.  We have a company that went into liquidation and do not know when payments will be processed.  We do not know if we can access MIBI to process some of the payments.  We do not know how many commercial claims will not be paid by any of the funds.  It has properly been highlighted that the great concern here is that claims in some cases involve matters of life and death.  We are talking about serious injuries, death and people in very vulnerable situations.  It is very clear that there will be no quick fix in this and that the matter will go on for a number of months until the liquidator finds out what assets and liabilities he has and whether the fund must be accessed.<\/p><p>  Mr. Sheridan said that it was unprecedented to have an insurance company go into liquidation.  Could we not look at a situation - tell me if I am just crackers on this - where the insurance fund pays out 65% of all claims and becomes a creditor of the assets of the company?  The insurance fund is going to pay out 65% of all claims anyway up to a maximum of &euro;825,000.  Obviously things are structured a certain way, but instead of all this red tape could we not start to act in the interests of citizens - the claimants out there - and introduce legislation, if necessary, to provide that the insurance fund can pay out 65% of all claims where a company goes into liquidation?  While people may get more if there are assets within the company, there would be an up-front payment.  The insurance fund would then recoup whatever it could from the assets of the liquidated company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014070900016#R02800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404918600,"counter":642,"content":"<p>That is a fair question.

The purpose of the fund is to pay out where there is a valid claim.  Its purpose is not to delay payments or otherwise.  Right now, there is an absence regarding what the liquidator's position is.  We need to await the outcome of that to get some indication of what is available for redistribution from its assets and see the impact of that.  We also need to wait for the legal advice and the outcome of that consideration and see what role the fund can play in respect of making the claims.  We will reflect on the suggestion made.

Setanta went into voluntary liquidation because it was unable to meet its liabilities.  When it went in at the end of January, it was on the basis that there was to be an orderly wind-down of the company.  The information provided by the Maltese regulator in response to the committee's queries sets out quite clearly that a number of attempts were made by the company from the end of January until mid-April to get adverse claims development cover to assist in a process in which it had a party interested in buying the company.  That fell through after due diligence and the company was unable to put additional capital in.  In that light, the company was put into liquidation on a voluntary basis.  The distinction is that one was put into liquidation and, therefore, the terms of the liquidation set out in the ICF apply subject to cappings, etc., while the other one was put into administration because it needed a period of time to get over a financial difficulty but was seen as being able to trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014070900017#S01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Casey"},{"type":"speech","time":1404919200,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I understand.

They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such as way as to make him or her identifiable.<br \/>I welcome His Excellency, Mr. Javad Kachoueian, Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Ireland.  The ambassador has a distinguished career in his country's diplomatic service, both in Tehran and in various locations abroad.  Members of the committee will be aware that Ambassador Kachoueian was only recently appointed to his current position in Dublin.  While he has met with some members of the joint committee, this is his first appearance before the committee in formal session.  Earlier this year, Ambassador Kachoueian paid a courtesy call to me and I was delighted to renew that relationship which existed with his predecessor.  It is always good to have dialogue.<br \/>We are conscious of the various ongoing problems in the Middle East.  For the past three years, there has been conflict in Syria, which unfortunately is showing no sign of being resolved.  More recently, we have seen an escalation of fighting in Iraq, while the situation in Egypt continues to be a cause of concern.  Perhaps more worryingly is the recent deterioration of the situation between Israel and Palestine.  The tit-for-tat - apparently revenge - attacks continue to escalate daily.  Almost hourly we hear of rocket attacks and air strikes, as the views of moderates on both sides appear to be ignored.  Indeed, at lunchtime today, there were further reports of more people being killed in Gaza.<br \/>The Middle East crisis is obviously something that the committee has dealt with.  We would certainly appeal for restraint because tit-for-tat attacks achieve nothing whatsoever.  The Israelis have been very lucky that nobody was killed by the rockets going into Israel.  Unfortunately, however, many people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli air attacks, which do not solve the problem that is there.  This committee appeals for both sides to show restraint.  We will be talking to the Israeli and Palestinian ambassadors soon to see if the situation can be resolved peacefully.<br \/>We are well aware of the role and influence Iran has in the region.  Members of the committee are eagerly anticipating Ambassador Kachoueian's views on what is happening in the Middle East, including the nuclear talks concerning Iran.  In addition, Ambassador Kachoueian takes a keen interest in what is happening in Syria.<br \/>The format of today's meeting is that we will hear a presentation from the ambassador before proceeding to a question and answer session with members of the committee.  I call Ambassador Kachoueian to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014070900002#A00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404912600,"counter":682,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Chairman, honourable Deputies and Senators.  In the name of God, the compassionate and merciful, I am pleased to have been invited here to exchange views on different aspects of bilateral relations, as well as important regional and international issues with the committee.<\/p><p>  Iran attaches great importance to its relations with Ireland.  The people of my country have always had good feelings towards Ireland and the Irish people.  Iran and Ireland have always had good relations with each other.<\/p> <p>It is very important that there is no negative point in our mutual relations.  We hope very much that the already friendly relations between our countries will develop and deepen under our mutual efforts.  Fortunately, there is much capacity and potential in our relations in different political, economic, trade, scientific and cultural fields.  We share many common international policies, including the importance of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and rejecting unilateralism and the use of military force in solving international and regional crises.  We continue to co-operate with Ireland on these issues.<\/p><p> There is lots of potential and there are many possibilities for the two countries.  The value of the annual trade in beef before the appearance of BSE, which caused the ban on the importation of Irish beef, was more than $500 million.  Fortunately, the ban on the importation of Irish beef was lifted last year and the legal ground for the importation of Irish sheepmeat was also prepared.  Other than meat, there are many other potential areas of trade, including IT, petrochemicals, petroleum and petroleum products, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, food and agriculture stuffs and renewable energy.  Iran is a very safe country in the Middle East with a population of 77 million people.  It could be a great market for Irish goods, especially in view of the fact that Irish goods, in the format of joint ventures between Iranian and Irish companies, can be re-exported to the markets of our 15 neighbouring countries, whose populations total 200 million.  The current annual volume of trade between our two countries is approximately &euro;50 million, which is by no means proportionate with the potential and the possibilities.  We can easily increase our mutual annual trade to &euro;1 billion in a year.<\/p><p> Iran, with its huge oil and gas resources, equivalent to 400 billion barrels, is the world's largest source of fossil energy.  There are two main pillars in Iran's sustainable development program: first, securing long-term sustainable energy in Iran; and second, participation in global energy security.  We are ready to co-operate on these issues as well.  The population in Iran is mainly young and therefore the number of youths looking for seats in universities in all fields has been increasing.  Nowadays, there are 600,000 students taking part in doctorate degree entrance exams each year.  Only 70,000 of them can enter universities in Iran; the rest must find universities abroad.  Given the presence of a few high-ranking universities in Ireland, the two countries can work successfully in this area as well.  Nevertheless, there are some obstacles, namely the long process of granting visas to foreign students, which needs to be solved.  There is lots of potential for mutual cultural co-operation in the arts, including painting and film, and in exploring and rehabilitating historical monuments.  Iran is among the ten leading countries internationally with regard to the presence of historical places.  There is a good potential for Iran and Ireland to expand their co-operation in the field of the tourism industry.  We have already had some university and media delegations visiting Iran, namely DIT and Dublin's Griffith College, and the recent visit of some Irish journalists.  A few MOUs have been signed between Irish and Iranian universities and scientific institutions.<\/p><p> Iran attaches specific importance to the promotion of parliamentary relations between the two countries.  The Parliament, as the the main pillar of the legislative branch, has an outstanding position in the political system of Iran.  Iran's parliaments have always been diverse, containing women and many ethnic minorities.  It also designates five seats for religious minorities, including Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, proportionate to their populations.  The recent visit of the parliamentary delegation headed by Deputy Pat Breen, the Chairman of the joint committee, was a good event in the annals of official contacts between the two countries.  The delegation had different useful and constructive negotiations with Iranian officials, including the Speaker of Parliament and the Foreign Minister.  The visit received good coverage in the Iranian mass media.  Following that visit, our Speaker of Parliament officially invited Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, the Ceann Comhairle, for an official visit to Tehran.  The visit will take place in September of this year.  We are also working on the visit of Mr. Heravi, the head of the Iran-Ireland Parliamentary Friendship Group, to Ireland in the near future.  The visit to Iran last week of a delegation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - Mr. Barrie Robinson, political director, and Mr. Pat Kelly, director general for Middle East and the north African region - was also a good development in our mutual relations.  We are aware of Ireland's important role in EU and international and regional organisations as well as in maintaining peace and security.  Irish peacekeeping forces under UNIFIL in Lebanon and the Golan Heights perform an important and useful role in that field.  Like Ireland, Iran attaches great importance to the peaceful and diplomatic solution of regional and international crisis.  Iran, as one of the most important and effective countries in the Middle East, is always ready to exchange views with Ireland on important regional and international issues.<\/p><p> I congratulate Ireland on its successful exit from the troika bailout programs.  It is a good sign which indicates the recovery of the economic situation and the restoration of the economic reputation of Ireland.  We hope, with the reopening the Irish embassy in Tehran and the efforts of the two embassies, to witness the further deepening and development of our relations.  Once again, I express my gratitude to the organisers of the committee for the opportunity that has been given to me to meet with the members to discuss regional and international issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014070900002#A00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

Both sides are talking about how to draft the contract document.  According to the strong religious fatwa from the Supreme Leader issued in 2005, any activities such as the production, stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, are forbidden.  The members witnessed during the war between Iran and Iraq that when the Iraqi side used chemical weapons we did not respond, for this reason.  Based on the fatwa, as the Supreme Leader has said, the possession of nuclear weapons is a sin, and having such weapons is absolutely prohibited since they endanger the existence of humanity.  The nuclear fatwa is a principled one since the existence of humanity is at stake.  The fatwa is not dependent on time and circumstance.  It establishes a precedent that future religious leaders may not discard.<\/p><p>  The fatwa should be taken as an assurance that Iran has no intention of building such weapons.  It can be adopted as an official United Nations document as a way to build confidence.  Based on the fatwa, Iran has called for all nuclear sovereigns to create a world without nuclear weapons.  We are also in favour of militaries free from nuclear weapons.  Nuclear arms do not have any place in our defence structure.  The nuclear issue in Iran is not about nuclear weapons.  The issue is that the people of my country cannot accept others telling them not to have a peaceful nuclear programme.  We want to use this technology only for peaceful purposes.  We are ready to remove all concern and to respond to all questions raised by the \"five plus\" countries in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014070900003#B00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I had an opportunity recently to meet him to be briefed on different issues.<\/p><p>  Last week, in response to a parliamentary question, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade indicated there has been progress in the nuclear issue and Iran is engaging fully in resolving it.  Is it hoped the deadline for agreement by 20 July will be met?  To my knowledge, the agreements reached in November last have been honoured.<\/p><p>  In 2013, Ireland exported &euro;57 million of products to Iran with &euro;1 million of imports coming into this country from Iran.  There is the potential for a substantial increase in trade.  One statistic that stood out was that, prior to the imposition of sanctions, the EU was Iran&rsquo;s major trading partner with trade worth &euro;28 billion.  This is now down to &euro;6 billion while trade with China has grown dramatically and is projected to grow substantially over the next several years.<\/p><p>  I raised the issue of human rights and the treatment of minority groups in Iran with the ambassador&rsquo;s predecessor at this committee before.  The Baha'i community in Ireland has brought to my attention serious issues concerning the treatment of some of its members in Iran.  There is a need for the human rights dialogue between the EU and Iran to resume.  It is an issue that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade raised with his Iranian counterpart some time ago.  I am also concerned, to put it mildly, about the report by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Centre that 624 people were executed in Iran in 2013.  The number officially announced by the Iranian Government was 334.  There should be no executions whatsoever.  The number of those executed in 2014 to date is estimated at 250 people.  None of us has words to describe that type of conduct.  No one has the right to take life.

It is important Iran focuses on human rights issues.  There is a disparity of culture but we must respect the ambassador&rsquo;s culture.<\/p> <p>However, there are some fundamentals in human rights that are universal.  They would certainly be about freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.  In particular, there are concerns with regard to people involved in opposition politics not being allowed to articulate their viewpoint or freely participate in the political situation.  Having a robust democratic system would, ultimately, be to the betterment of Iran.  <\/p><p> The issue of capital punishment has been mentioned by some of my colleagues.  It is not just a problem for Iran but is a problem in the US and various other countries across the globe, including Russia.  It is a very significant human rights issue now upon which an increasing focus is being brought.  Iran also executes minors which would be very unusual even among countries that have capital punishment.  Will the ambassador comment on that?  <\/p><p> The other issue is freedom of religion, which is often spoken about but not observed as often even, unfortunately, in parts of Europe.  Apostasy is a capital crime in Iran which seems to be an appalling breach of a person's human rights.  We all saw the situation with Mariam Ibrahim in Sudan recently but there have also been situations in Iran.  This committee argued vigorously with the ambassador's predecessor with regard to Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani who was subjected to incarceration for quite a period because of his religious beliefs.  Given Iran's leadership in the region, anything it does should have an influence upon the thinking in the Middle East, which does need to change.  There are aspects of Iran's conservative policies with which people might not have difficulties but there are also aspects which are very oppressive and which, in this instance, would be seen as breaches of human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014070900004#C02100","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404913800,"counter":708,"content":"<p>We will stick with human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014070900005#D00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404913800,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their questions.  First, President Rouhani has introduced a charter of citizens' rights in which the rights of all minorities have been mentioned and emphasised.  Like other governments, we have a duty to promote human rights in our country.  We believe that human rights must be promoted in all countries.  Human rights dialogue should be based on mutual respect and can be a universal subject when only human rights are considered rather than political considerations.  The people of my country say that those who do not allow the purchase of medicine needed for patients in Iran have no right to comment on human rights.  The western attitude towards the human rights issue has become political behaviour and is based on double standards.  I have many examples I can show the committee.  In respect of the worst violator of human rights in the Middle East, the Israeli regime regularly violates human rights in Palestine.  Some of the rules and regulations in our country are based on Islamic law and cannot be changed.  We are not happy about the number of executions in Iran.  Most capital punishment in Iran is performed in respect of major drug traffickers who are not only a threat to Iran but to the whole world.  We could reduce the number of executions by 90% by allowing the transit of drugs into Europe.

He must have been delighted to read in the newspapers that Ireland is the country in the world that is most faithful to the values of the Koran.  This finding comes from a study conducted by an Iranian colleague of the ambassador who occupies a high ranking position in a wonderful university, George Washington University.  Those of us who are secularists might find this difficult to understand.<\/p><p>  When the ambassador was addressing the issue of human rights, he noted that Islamic law cannot be changed.  I consider Iran as a key player in the world.  There are conflicts right across the Arab, Muslim and Christian world, and Iran plays an important role.  I refer to the Middle East, Israel, Iraq and Syria.  Given the ambassador's strict interpretation of Islamic law and the laws of Iran, how do we interpret Islamic law through the Koran?  For example, Saudi Arabia, which is another might world power, has a different interpretation.  The Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant, which has just been announced, claims religious authority over all Muslims under its supreme leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.<\/p> <p>He will have a different interpretation of Islamic law.  How many of these conflicts are based on religion rather than politics?  How many of those who are dying as a result of the activities of Boko Haram and al-Shabaab in countries such as Nigeria, Mali, Mauritania, Kenya, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Egypt are the victims of a religious war, rather than a political struggle as these conflicts are sometimes interpreted?  How does the ambassador explain this terrible blood-letting between Shia and Sunni to people from the west who come from liberal democratic, Christian societies?  <\/p><p> I am delighted the Ceann Comhairle will visit Iran because the more interaction our two countries have, the more we will understand each other.<\/p><p> On the issue of fundamental human rights, how can Iran claim its interpretation of the Koran is correct and justifies stoning people to death, executing gay and lesbian and transgender people and so forth?<\/p><p> The challenge is to define what role Iran is playing in the world?  Is it assisting or undermining stability?  We spoke about the conflict in and around Israel and the funding and training of Hamas and Hezbollah.  Are these progressive forces?

In my country there are also different ideas about some verses of the Koran.  Unfortunately, groups in Syria and Iraq misuse Islam for their objectives.  We are trying our best to find ways to reduce capital punishment through the good interpretation of Islam.  We are unhappy about the number of executions in Iran.  I am sure the delegation to Iran had a good discussion about this with the brother of the girl in Iran, and discussed the execution and the issue of the Baha'i with the Iranian authorities and have had a response about it.<\/p><p>  We should be careful because, unfortunately, some groups such as ISIS, also known as DAISH, try to misuse Islam for their political objectives.  Unfortunately, it can absorb many young people to fight in Syria and Iraq.  Many times we cautioned the authorities in Europe to be careful not to help those groups in Syria.  Unfortunately, they did not understand the groups in the region, so they helped them when they were in Syria.  Now, after Syria, they have gone to Iraq and are trying to reach the other countries in the region.  Today, our deputy foreign Minister is in Kuwait because there is concern there about ISIS.  ISIS does not recognise Kuwait as a state.  We are trying to work with all our neighbouring countries to control ISIS in the region.  ISIS assassinated Sunni clergymen in Mosul last week, and they prayed the Friday prayers there.<\/p><p>  Although, unfortunately, much of the mass media has portrayed this as a war between Shia and Sunni, it is incorrect.  ISIS has assassinated Sunni people, and some Sunni clergymen in different countries have criticised ISIS and condemned their activities.  I want to clarify the situation.  We must be careful.  We are witnessing two important challenges in our region, namely, extremism and terrorism.  It is necessary for all international communities and members of the committee to help the Iraqi Government to fight terrorism.  They want to continue their activities in other countries throughout the region.  Unfortunately, some countries have helped these groups before, but now they understand that they made a major mistake.  The foreign minister of Iraq, Mr. Hoshyar Zebari, is a Kurdish Sunni.  In an official letter to the United Nations Secretary General, which has been issued to the Security Council, he has asked the United Nations and all its members to fight against al-Qaeda and ISIS.  In the letter, Mr. Zebari officially asked the United Nations to prevent the terrorists from receiving support.  The war is not between Shia and Sunni.  In Iran, many Sunnis live peacefully with Shias, and many Shias live peacefully in Saudi Arabia and other countries.  Fortunately, in principle there are no differences between Shia and Sunni except for a very small few interpretations.  However, unfortunately, some countries are using terrorism to change the political system.  This is the real problem of our region.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014070900008#G00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

My country welcomed the recent presidential election in Syria and thinks it is the beginning of a new phase of stability and national reconciliation.  We very much hope that other countries will make necessary a force for the assistance of the refugees as well as the reconstruction process in Syria.  On 1 June, our parliament organised a one-day conference on Syria for heads of parliamentary committees on foreign policy.  The Chairman of this committee, Deputy Pat Breen, was invited, but unfortunately he could not be there.<\/p> <p>The aim of holding the conference was to attempt to stop the massacre of the oppressed Syrian people and the destruction of resources and to prevent the expansion of terrorism and extremism.<\/p><p> The Deputy is right that we help the Syrian Government.  Up to now, we have given more than $6.2 million to the Syrian people in medicine, food and so on.  Unfortunately, we are under severe sanctions, but in spite of that, we think the Syrian people need food and medicine and we want all countries to help them in this regard.<\/p><p> We think the activities of extremist groups are the main threat to peace and security of the region and the world.  Members of these groups will return to their home countries, becoming a potential threat to the security of those countries.  They will be able to organise other incidents similar to the attacks of 11 September 2001.  I have heard more than 1,500 Britons went to Iraq and people travelled there from other European countries.  We should be careful because they will be educated, they will learn how to fight and to make bombs, and when they return to their countries, unfortunately, there may be weaknesses in the security of those countries.<\/p><p> The fight against violent extremism, sectarian conflict and terrorism is Iran's main objective.  In Syria, we are in contact with almost all parties, including Opposition parties, except for armed groups.  If those groups get into power in Syria, we are sure they will assassinate the Christians there but, fortunately, the Christians in Syria now have good relations with Assad and the Syrian Government.  We cannot impose democracy on countries by military force.  Democracy is a process that needs time.  Unfortunately, some Western countries misuse the situations in Iraq and Syria.  I do not want to name them.  The doctrine is to create problems and to control them for political motivation.<\/p><p> The UN Secretary General recently expressed disappointment about the Security Council's failure to reach a consensus on finding a political solution to the Syrian crisis and, therefore, he has urged Syria's neighbouring countries to block their borders to prevent weapons smuggling into Syria.  Doubtless, such measures shall prove a positive step towards preventing the expansion of the phenomenon of terrorism.  We believe that all parties must be involved in the government of Syria.

These people were educated and learned how to fight and they have now gone to Iraq.  After Iraq, they went to other countries.  Unfortunately, the Syrian people were mentioned, but it was not them.  These people come from different countries from Syria, but in some countries they were Syrians.  Some countries want to use the terrorists to change the political system, and it is the same in Iraq.  Recently, in Mosul, more than 1 million people participated in the Iraqi election.  The majority were Sunnis, and this shows that the people of Iraq accepted the government but, unfortunately, after ISIS went into the cities, the people were frightened by them.  Last week, ISIS assassinated a Sunni clergyman in Mosul who was not ready to collaborate with them.<\/p><p>  We should be very careful.  It is not to the benefit of the entire international community to use terrorism to change the political system.  This is the main issue in Syria and Iraq, and perhaps in future in other countries.  We should let people exercise democracy.

When I visited the UN last year, Iran voted against the arms trade treaty.  This relates to small arms, which have caused a great deal of devastation, particularly in his region but also in parts of Africa.  Ireland supported it.  That position does not sit with our sharing common international policies.<\/p><p>  The ambassador referred to the protection of Christians in Syria under the Assad regime.  This was also true of the Hussein regime in Iraq, under which Christians and other minorities were protected.  Once the Shia took control of Iraq, many Christians had to leave and some were murdered.   What does that say about Islam and a policy of ethnic cleansing in countries where Christians have lived for more than 2,000 years?   What is the psyche of Islamists that causes this to happen?  The ambassador will agree that Christians were much safer under the brutal regimes of dictators who were not popular globally or within their countries.<\/p> <p> The former Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, spoke about the obliteration of Israel.  What is the position of the current administration on that?  We, in my party, and people generally in Ireland have taken a position of supporting the Palestinians' calls for a homeland, which is very justifiable.  We have also condemned the atrocities committed by organisations, such as Hamas, and also by the Israeli security forces which have been equally savage in the way they have retaliated on innocent civilians.  However, we would strongly hold the view that any resolution of that conflict has to accept the existence and protection of Israeli citizens and borders once they are agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014070900009#H00400","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404916200,"counter":777,"content":"<p>What is the ambassador's view on what is happening?

How many refugees has Iran taken in from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq?  Does Iran get international support in this regard?  When we were in Tehran we spoke about the drug situation, particularly drugs coming from Afghanistan.  At one stage there was an agreement between the European Union, Iran and other countries in the region on drug smuggling.  This agreement has fallen apart and one of the reasons given by the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs was that drug smugglers are executed in Iran.  Is there potential to have co-operation again between international players in the region, particularly the European Union?  How does the ambassador see this developing in the future?  When we were there we were told the poppy crop in the region had quadrupled.  Much of it goes through Iran but there are other corridors also.  People in Europe and other regions are concerned it will end up on the streets.  We already see drugs getting cheaper in Dublin.  I am interested to hear the ambassador's response.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Palestinian situation, many calls have been made for restraint from all sides, which is usual when there is conflict.  Does the ambassador agree there is no equity of response with regard to what happens in the region?  There is no equality in what is happening between Hamas and the Israelis or between the Palestinians and Israel.  This in itself is part of the problem which needs to be resolved.

Iran has more than 3 million Afghan refugees.  Unfortunately we do not get help from the international community.  The majority of them have been educated in Iran, they have married and mix with members of the Iranian community and they work in Iran.  We had many discussions with the international community about getting help, but unfortunately we did not obtain help.<\/p><p>  With regard to co-operation between the EU and Iran on narcotics, prior to 2003 I was the director of the first European department of the Foreign Ministry and I was a member of the Iranian delegation which negotiated with the EU.  The three topics we discussed at the time were refugees, how to combat narcotics and the Middle East.  Discussions have resumed to find solutions to the benefit of the region and the international community.  The drug traffickers in Afghanistan told us to give them a short transit route and if we did so they would not distribute narcotics in Iran.  The aim of these groups is to distribute drugs in Europe and not Iran.  We could not agree with this so we fought against them.  Unfortunately, we did not receive any help from European countries.  The gangs have high-quality technology to fight against our soldiers on the border.<\/p><p>  A number of years ago our leader made a suggestion on the situation in Palestine.  He said Palestinians should be allowed return to their homes and a referendum should be held to select a government for the region, under the auspices of the United Nations.  More than 4 million Palestinians are in different countries and they want to return home.  The international community has a responsibility in this regard to help the Palestinians.  For every one Israeli killed more than two or three dozen Palestinians are killed in a bombardment.  This is not fair.  Unfortunately, the situation in Palestine has created terrorism, which has also been experienced in other areas in the region such as Syria and Iraq and perhaps will happen in other countries.  Kuwaiti officials are very concerned.  Some countries may have helped these groups but now they are frightened and very concerned about ISIS because it has declared an Islamic government, which means it wants to control the entire region.  Terrorism is very dangerous for the peace and security of the region and for the world.  The Iraqi Government has asked the international community for help.<\/p> <p>I believe the time is right to help the Iraqi Government in its fight against terrorism.  Without this help for the Iraqi Government, there will be many problems for the international community in the future.

We believe that in terms of the peace process a two-state solution is the way forward.  Obviously, the situation is difficult.  We appeal to Israel to discontinue its attacks on Gaza.  This is extremely important in the context of the number of innocent people being killed as a result of those attacks.

My name is Alan Jackman and I know nothing about banking except what I have learned through my experience.  I spent 20 years in the telecommunications industry and while I understand my motivation in this regard has also been circulated to each member, essentially it is that one should get a fair go, regardless of one's background or status in society.  The legislation that is the subject of my petition is the Central Bank Act 1942, in particular Part IIIC, and the administrative sanction procedure derived from that legislation.  However, I contend the real issue at the centre of my petition is in fact the public administration of justice and equality before the law.<br \/>Financial regulation in Ireland, including the pursuit of wrongdoing - even wrongdoing that is of a potentially criminal nature - takes place under the provisions contained in the Central Bank Act 1942.  These provisions include the strict professional secrecy provisions.  The reason for such secrecy at the heart of the regulatory framework appears to be based on the following thinking, namely, the Financial Regulator and the regulatory framework are in place to protect the banking system, not to protect the State or to vindicate the rights of the citizens, in the belief that protecting the banks and the banking system is in the interests of the economy and that a stable economy is in the public interest.<br \/>The administrative sanction procedure essentially sets out how a separate legal system for regulated financial service providers works.  The procedure sets out how the Financial Regulator will deal with a financial institution if it suspects that the institution has committed a prescribed contravention.  A prescribed contravention will have been committed by an institution if it breaks the law or does not comply with a statutory instrument or code.  I contend that the provisions contained in the Act and the administrative sanction procedure essentially constitute a separate legal system for banks and banking professionals, administered in secret by central banking professionals who themselves are sworn to secrecy.  Is the administrative sanction procedure constitutional?  The arrangements set down legislation appear to be contrary to the Constitution, in that they are not in accordance with the principle of the public administration of justice.  All citizens are equal before the law and it fails to protect citizens and vindicate their rights.<br \/>There is also a conflict of interest at the heart of the regulatory framework because I contend that the Financial Regulator as presently constituted is fundamentally compromised in supervising and regulating the banking system.  The people it pursues for wrongdoing are the same people whose co-operation it needs to make the system work.  In 2012, the British Government recognised this conflict of interest at the heart of its regulatory framework and split its regulatory authority in two.  As for EU directives, while I cannot make this point with real certainty, I have been informed that these provisions within the Act have been enacted to comply with European Union directives that have been continually updated.  I contend that every nation state reserves the right to make its own laws and it may make sense to enact such provisions to deal with the prudential elements, that is, issues to do with capital ratios and all the technical matters.  I understand why such matters must be subject to secrecy because one does not want to have runs on banks or people to lose complete faith and confidence in the system.  However, it is an entirely different matter to enact these provisions and have them cover elements of financial regulation that relate to the conduct of financial institutions and their employees.  Another issue is the vindicating of citizen's rights, with which I will deal at a later stage as I go through my submission.<br \/>I will now provide a more detailed explanation of the legislation underpinning the administrative sanction procedure.  As part of the administrative sanction procedure, the Financial Regulator can dispense with inquiries and go straight to a sanction.  In other words, it may have serious issues before it but might decide to not bother to look into them as the bank will settle or it will go straight to a section and that will be it.  It can summon, make findings, caution, reprimand, disqualify and sanction.  This can make settlement at any stage of the inquiry process and can grant immunity from criminal prosecution by levying a fine.  As for appeals, the financial institution can appeal the decision of the Financial Regulator to the High Court.  This effectively is why I am suggesting this is a legal system.  I noticed something while reading the 2013 version of the outline on the administrative sanction procedure, which stated:<blockquote>The Central Bank may decide to pursue prescribed contraventions through the Administrative Sanctions Procedure instead of bringing a summary prosecution.  However, the Central Bank will consider the circumstances of each case on its merits and may decide to pursue matters which constitute both a prescribed contravention and a criminal offence via the criminal courts. In deciding whether to pursue criminal proceedings, the Central Bank will exercise its discretion, having regard to the Director of Public Prosecution&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guidelines for Prosecutors&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>This raises a question that I cannot answer, namely, is the Central Bank doing the job of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  If that is the case, it is a serious matter but that is what is written in the Central Bank's outline document in which it describes how this procedure actually works.<br \/>The next issue probably is the reason I am appearing before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions today and is whether a person can make a complaint to the regulator.  The answer is no, he or she cannot.  A person cannot make a complaint against a financial institution or an individual within financial section to the Financial Regulator, even where the complaint involves criminality and where the person is the injured party.  If a person approaches the Financial Regulator with instances of wrongdoing in a bank, even where it involves potential criminality or wrongdoing that is being perpetrated against him or her, the person will be informed that the Financial Regulator cannot investigate individual complaints.  I have submitted documents to this joint committee showing that this is indeed the case.  In addition, in a reply to parliamentary questions tabled on my behalf, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated: &quot;There is no impediment on any person from making any complaint to the Central Bank about a bank or an employee of a bank.&quot;  I can only go on what I have been informed by the Central Bank twice or thrice, which is that this is not the case and one cannot make a complaint.<br \/>I will now elaborate on various sections within the actual Act itself.  Section 33AK contains the actual secrecy provisions and it covers absolutely everything.  If a person puts information before the Financial Regulator, the person cannot be informed whether the matter has been subsequently investigated or the outcome of any ensuing investigation.  As for section 33AZ, according to the Central Bank's own outline of the administrative sanctions procedure the Financial Regulator can hold the final part of its sanction inquiry in public.  Although the Financial Regulator states it would like to do this, I am not aware of any sanction inquiries ever being held in public.  However, in accordance with section 33AZ of the Act, it cannot do so where the regulator suspects the law has been broken and a banking professional's reputation may be damaged or the wrongdoing relates to matters of a confidential nature.  In these cases, the hearing must be held in private and subject to the strict professional secrecy provisions.  There may be a situation in which the Financial Regulator may wish to do with something in private and does not wish to prejudice a court case at later stage.  Nevertheless, this still involves having a legal system that is subject to secrecy.<\/p> <p>Last year there was a case in Dublin which engaged a member of the public who had pornographic images on their PC.  RTE went to court.  In the interests of the public administration of justice, the person was presumed innocent pending trial, but they were actually named.  We have had cases in which people in other professions who had defective vehicles such as a bus or been driving carelessly did not get the benefit of secrecy because of their profession.<br \/>Section 33AT of the Central Bank Act states:<blockquote>No criminal prosecution may be brought if the prescribed contravention in question has already been subject to an inquiry under the administrative sanction procedure which led to an imposition of a monetary penalty.<\/blockquote>This seems to suggest that if a bank is fined as a result of a contravention, no criminal prosecution can follow after that date.  It is meant, understandably, to ensure a bank is not punished twice.<br \/>While section 33AP is easy to explain, its implications are more difficult.  The Central Bank must inform a financial institution that it suspects it of engaging in wrongdoing and order it to stop via an examination letter which will specify the grounds on which the suspicions are based.  If a whistleblower comes forward with information of wrongdoing in a financial institution, the suspicions will be detailed in the examination letter.  The whistleblower will not be protected by having the complaint publicly recorded and acknowledged like in a trial because it all happens in secret.<br \/>The Central Bank is actually publishing settlements, not just sanctions, at this stage, as a result of a decision made by Mr. Elderfield when he was in charge.  In a sense, this gives protection because once everyone knows about a whistleblower from an early stage, it is actually more difficult to pick on him or her.  It also raises an issue around secrecy.  I spoke about conflicts of interest.  There could be a situation where one does not want a bank to suffer a serious loss, but, at the same time, an investigator knows the law is being broken.  Pressure could be put on the investigator to forget the issue because it is all covered by secrecy.  It affects not only whistleblowers but also investigators.<br \/>Sections 33AR and 33AV allow the Financial Regulator, with the consent of the financial institution, to dispense with an inquiry and impose on the financial service provider a sanction or enter into an agreement in writing.  Could this result in the covering up of other wrongdoing?  The Financial Regulator, like the courts system, is not directly accountable for its decisions taken in pursuit of wrongdoing to the Government, the Oireachtas or the public.  The courts system, however, unlike the regulator, makes itself accountable by holding its hearings in public and acquires its credibility by not publicly administering justice but by publishing judgments made by its judges.  <br \/>Sections 33AK and 33AZ ensure that not only will investigations undertaken by the regulator and the outcomes remain secret, except if they result in a sanction, but, in addition, that the sanctions inquiry hearing will also take place in secret for the reasons set out in section 33AZ.  How can the public be assured that the impact of the 2010 Central Bank Reform Act and the various consumer protection codes is not diminished by these provisions?  The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s overriding objective is to protect the financial system, not the State or the citizen.  The recent legislative changes have been very much diminished because hearings take place in secret and the public cannot lodge formal complaints.  This means that we still must have blind faith in the regulator.<br \/>In 2011 the Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, was reported by RTE as having said:<blockquote>It was a criminal offence to demand repayment so frequently as to cause alarm, distress or humiliation; to tell a debtor they are guilty of a criminal offence; to pretend to be officially authorised by law to enforce payment and that unjustified enrichment of creditors was also prohibited under law.<\/blockquote>The Financial Services Ombudsman only offers binding arbitration as a means to resolve civil disputes between financial institutions and customers.  It is not an appropriate body to deal with the types of issue referred to by the Master of the High Court.  When I raised this matter with the Department of Finance in a parliamentary question, it stated:<blockquote>The Central Bank may not, however, in every instance be the most appropriate authority to whom the complaint should be made.  This will depend on the subject matter of the complaint.<\/blockquote>I do not believe these matters should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance.  I also do not believe bank employees should be subject to Garda investigation.  At the same time, however, I do believe members of the public are entitled to protection and have their rights vindicated.  It is the regulatory authority that should do this.  In such matters, including psychological violence as outlined by the Master of the High Court, a person should be permitted to lodge a formal complaint with the regulatory authority.  In an ironic twist, the Central Bank has people in the banks ensuring this does not happen.<br \/>I have submitted the sequence of events that led to me making my petition to the committee.  Without going into it too much, I engaged with the Department of Finance for two and a half years.  In that time it did not really address the matters I had raised.  I was asked if I had mortgage arrears, which I did not, and whether I could go to the Ombudsman.  I was dealing with capable officials who understood the legislation and its implications.  I have passed on to the petitions committee the correspondence in which the officials stated they would not bring my concerns to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.<br \/>In 2009 I got into a dispute with a bank.  I copied various e-mails between me and the institution and sent them to an official in the Central Bank.  In a subsequent telephone conversation the official told me that he was wondering if I would ever ring him.  He told me he understood my e-mails which impressed me because they were convoluted, detailed and tedious.  He wanted to investigate the matter and informed me that he required a one line e-mail instructing him to do so.  It may reflect badly on me, but I did not do so for the reasons I have outlined.  He told me that owing to the strict professional secrecy provisions in the Central Bank Act, he would not be able to tell me if he had investigated the matter or its outcome, except in the unlikely event that a sanction was imposed.  If that were to be the case, it would be published in the national newspapers.<\/p> <p>It would not publish it on its website.  They are the two related issues. <\/p><p> I would like the committee to bring the matter to the attention of the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Finance.  I would like it to endeavour to have it debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann because the single supervisory mechanism is coming up for discussion.  All banks in Europe will be supervised, but from what I have read in the newspapers, enforcement will remain within the remit of the actual Financial Regulator.  I would also like to bring this matter to the attention of other committees such as the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, where it may also be relevant.  <\/p><p> What legislative changes would I like to see?  I am not the person to answer that question, but the reason I ask it is it might be my only opportunity to do so, apart from the fact that I have thought about it for some time.  I do not want people to think I have any real idea about it.  It is a very complex issue.  Conduct should be separated from the prudential which is very complex.  Economic matters come into it; it is not just about banking.  Risk is also a factor.  When people have to make decisions from they do not get any benefit and are only acting for their institution, psychological factors come into play.  It is not straightforward.  When it comes to conduct, we already have a tried and trusted method - the courts system.  <\/p><p> I would like to see legislative changes to remove the conflict of interest at the heart of the regulatory framework.  As I stated previously about the position in the United Kingdom, I would like to see legislative change to confine the administrative sanction procedure and the strict professional secrecy provisions to matters relating to prudential regulation alone.  I understand there must be secrecy and that there must be a separate regulation, but what I am objecting to is the fact that matters relating to the public administration of justice have been co-opted into the area of financial regulation.  I would like to see a legislative change that would result in the establishment of a regulatory conduct authority incorporating a specialist unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that would work directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions in deciding if an alleged contravention merited a criminal prosecution.  I would like to see a legislative change to allow individuals to lodge a formal complaint with the financial conduct authority where they were the injured party.  I have very little knowledge of this area, but the making of complaints could be confined.  It has nothing to do with civil disputes.  If that is the case, one goes to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  If it has to do with psychological violence, that is a different matter.  I would like to see a legislative change that resulted in complaints and hearings being subject to a process that adhered to the public administration of justice.  <\/p><p> As I pointed out, my concerns about secrecy do not relate to the supervision of financial institutions, commercial agreements, prudential matters or anything to do with systemic risk.  Honesty is one of the cornerstones of the banking industry because there are no sanctions if one deals in untruths with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Honesty is paramount because it is binding arbitration.

Nobody can make that decision in respect of the pressures he faced, but we do know that if he had made a complaint, he would have been told that he could not make one and that he would not find out what investigation had taken place.  The second case history relates to share dealings in two financial institutions.  Again, I had to take direction from the Chairman, but for one person there was the public administration of justice, while the other was subject to the strict professional secrecy provisions.  The person in charge of the strict professional secrecy provisions was criticised by the judge in that case which was very high profile and one about which everybody was aware.   Everybody is aware of the suicide issue because the case was well publicised.  The third case history concerns a very famous whistleblower who appeared before Oireachtas committees.  The most important thing I wish to say about this person is that he and the regulator cannot agree on the year.  The issue is not the fact that the regulator asked the whistleblower to withdraw his allegations, the fact that the overcharging continued for two years or the fact that &euro;30 million was given to charity.  The real issue is that the regulator appeared before the Oireachtas committee and informed it that it had first became aware of the overcharging in 2004, while the whistleblower told the committee that he had informed the regulator two years earlier in 2002.

There is an element of prudence, which means we have to accept there will be secrecy, because they are technical matters pertaining to economies.  The regulator requires economists to deal with these issues.  We learned recently that psychology plays an important role.  If people lose money they will spend more money and, similarly, banks will risk more money.  There is also the law.  This is fine in that it deals with prudential behaviour and systemic risks for the banks.  However, I refer to conflicts of interest when people do something wrong.  A bus driver or even a doctor would be tried according to the principle of public administration of justice but banks get a special arrangement.  An example of conflict of interest is the decision as to whether it is preferable to see 10,000 mortgage holders get a bad deal or to save a bank that might cost the country &euro;10 billion that could be spent on hospitals and schools.  This is an extraordinary dilemma.<\/p><p>  The matter has to be considered as separate issues of prudential behaviour and conduct.  Where people are injured - I am not speaking about a monetary return - there are certain remedies.  However, if I am subjected to psychological violence I cannot go to anybody.  The Master of the High Court has drawn attention to this serious gap.  I am suggesting that, rather than the Garda or the Ombudsman, the regulator is the place to go with such complaints.  It might not result in a hearing or even an investigation but given that the regulator supervises these matters, it is the appropriate body to pursue a complaint.  I understand that if one makes a complaint to a garda, he or she will merely log it.  If 20 complaints are received on a subject, it is clear there is an issue, whereas at present all that is being done is supervision.  It is like garda&iacute; being able to check whether drivers are speeding but an individual not being able to inform them if he or she sees somebody breaking the speed limit.  I hope I have made it clear that there is a difference between prudential behaviour and conduct, and people being allowed to make a complaint which relates to serious matters such as honesty, psychological violence or potential injuries.  These can be confined, and the Ombudsman deals with everything else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014070900006#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Jackman"},{"type":"speech","time":1404919800,"counter":845,"content":"<p>Forgive me for not being here for the entire presentation.

I was privileged to be appointed a director of Bus &Eacute;ireann in April 2013 and have served on the audit review group and commercial and innovation committees; therefore, I am acutely aware of the issues facing the company.<\/p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates three businesses within one entity, namely, public service obligation, PSO, services in urban, commuter and rural areas; commercial services, primarily, Expressway services; and the school transport scheme.  The main remit of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s extensive network is to connect communities throughout the country with efficient, reliable services, while focusing on innovation through technology and investment in fleet and customer facilities.  PSO services, in particular, are an essential component of the Government's transport strategy for provincial rural Ireland.  <\/p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann had an annual turnover of &euro;324 million in 2013, recording an overall surplus of &euro;400,000.  This was achieved in very challenging conditions and delivered through growth in core revenue, with significant payroll savings and the continuation of a range of efficiency measures.<\/p> <p>The public service obligation, PSO,  payment of &euro;34.4 million in 2013 has been reduced by &euro;15 million or 30% in the last five years and will reduce to &euro;32 million in 2014, but passenger revenue, excluding schools, has increased by &euro;5 million since 2011.  In 2013, the company carried over 78 million passengers.  Passenger numbers on PSO and Expressway services increased by 0.4 million journeys and schools passenger journeys increased by 0.7 million.  These positive trends are continuing in 2014 with passenger numbers growing ahead of economic indicators, while operational costs, despite significant increases in fuel costs, have been reducing and customer satisfaction remains at a very high level.<br \/>Bus &Eacute;ireann provides direct employment to nearly 2,500 employees across the country and supports the employment of a further 7,500 among suppliers and subcontracted service providers across its network of services.  The company has been in survival mode in the past few years but it has worked through this difficult period while delivering on all commitments to the National Transport Authority, NTA, the Department of Education and Skills and in creating a framework for a sustainable public transport system.  The return on commercial Expressway services has improved, while still serving many locations in Ireland at no additional cost to the State and absorbing overheads in rural depots that would have to be allocated to PSO services.  Expressway is providing an integrated inter-regional connectivity, in particular where no rail services exist, helping to defray costs for public services.<br \/>There are four main challenges for Bus &Eacute;ireann arising from the recently agreed five year comprehensive strategic plan to invest further in the business, grow profitability and deliver a best-in-class public service transport offering.  The first key challenge is to grow revenue and passenger numbers, through focused investment and increasing<b><\/b>financial sustainability across the range of Bus &Eacute;ireann products.  We must continue to work in partnership with the NTA to negotiate and deliver the best possible public transport offering for PSO services provided under direct award contract through passenger and capacity growth on the core network along with fleet and facilities replacement.  We must reposition the Expressway brand along with network improvements for faster journey times and more competitive fares to improve profitability and provide funds for reinvestment.  Third, we must deliver further cost savings in the provision of school transport services, including the introduction of a new information technology, IT, system, while continuing to provide all the services required by the Department of Education and Skills.  Fourth, we must identify opportunities for new revenue streams, particularly in international markets.<br \/>The second challenge is to continue to build a competitive cost base<b><\/b>across all products to maintain competitiveness and ensure flexibility of customer service delivery.  The focus must be on delivering a safe, sustainable and competitive cost base with increased operational efficiencies and operational key performance indicators, KPIs, to meet market requirements which are benchmarked against best international practice.  One key requirement will be to work in a practical way with the NTA regarding the tendering of 10% of the direct award contract by the end of 2015 in order to ensure a cost neutral impact on the company and minimise the impact on staff.<br \/>The third challenge is to enhance relationships with customers, partners and stakeholders<b><\/b>across the community to further improve customer satisfaction and Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s corporate reputation.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a proud tradition of local transport delivery, working with local stakeholders and suppliers to keep public transport close to the community.  A renewed and invigorated customer focus is essential to grow public transport across the country.<br \/>The fourth main challenge<b><\/b>is to have a fully engaged, informed and committed workforce with the right skills and competencies to grow the business in a safe and effective manner in line with evolving market requirements.<br \/>In conclusion, I look forward to working with the Minister, the Departments, the NTA, the CIE chairman and the Bus &Eacute;ireann board and management to grow public transport in a sustainable, safe and efficient manner and to put in place an investment framework that makes it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900003#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404895200,"counter":879,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I and my party fully support his appointment as chairperson.  Obviously, it is for the Minister to move the appointment from designate to actual chairperson but the fact that he has identified Mr. Murphy as the chairperson designate appears to suggest that his appointment will be confirmed, and rightly so.  Given the time he has been involved with the board, Mr. Murphy has a deep understanding of the issues facing the company.  His qualifications and general understanding of public transport will bring the type of insight that is required to the company, which is clearly going through a transition.<\/p><p>  There are a couple of issues that I ask Mr. Murphy to address.  One is the challenge posed by the potential loss of the school transport business.  There has been an ongoing challenge to the way the Department of Education and Skills contracts with Bus &Eacute;ireann for school transport services.  I am not commenting on the decision of the Department in that regard, but has the board or the incoming chairperson given any consideration to the potential of losing that business at some stage?  If so, how would it impact on the viability of the company?<\/p><p>  Second, Mr. Murphy is aware that State subvention has been reducing over a period of time, in line with the current economic situation.  Coupled with that, there has been a general increase in fares for public transport.  What is his view of the theory of elasticity in regard to the pricing of tickets?  Does he believe we have reached a point beyond which further fare increases would lead to a shift away from public transport and back into the car, which clearly none of us wants?<\/p><p>  Third, is Mr. Murphy aware of any issues that pose significant risk to Bus &Eacute;ireann in the immediate or medium term?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900004#H00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404895200,"counter":881,"content":"<p>First, school transport revenue represents just over 50% of Bus &Eacute;ireann revenue, so it is a very significant part.  That said, we run it on behalf of the Department.  It is cost neutral from the point of the company in that respect.  However, it links in with the three specific entities within Bus &Eacute;ireann and for that reason it is important.  Untangling that would obviously have very significant impacts.  We do not anticipate, at this point, that the business will be lost to us.  We are certainly working very hard with the Department to improve further the cost base, cost competitiveness, IT systems, renew the fleet and so forth.  We recently put in place a new online system for parents to make bookings for children.  At all times we are bringing innovation to the service.  In the final analysis, we believe the service we are offering to the Department will stand scrutiny from any other competitors that might wish to consider it.  Certainly, in an international context we are well regarded in that area.<\/p><p>  With regard to the reduction in the subvention, unfortunately we are dealing with the reality of the current position.  Despite the positive signals emanating regarding the economy, and we all wish that will continue to be the case, we are under no illusion that there are still difficult times ahead.  It is not simply going to be a case of rolling back to further levels of subvention.  That is why we have a very strong emphasis on the competitiveness of the company and making it as competitive as possible, both to provide the best value PSO services on the one hand and, second, to provide an Expressway service that generates sufficient profits to allow us to reinvest in the product.<\/p> <p>Our five-year plan envisages that, from our resources, we will reinvest &euro;50 million in the fleet.  The average age of our vehicles on the PSO and Expressway service is of the order of six to seven years.  Given that we do 167 million km per year, people can imagine the distance travelled by each vehicle.  As they grow older, maintenance becomes a significant cost, and this has an impact on the profit and loss.  We will work with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Government.  Within the subvention levels, we would like to have the maximum we can but we are working to make ourselves as cost-competitive as we can to meet the challenges.  There are many challenges for the company in the coming years.  We are under no illusions.  In the area of competitiveness, 10% of our award will be contracted by the NTA at the end of 2015.  At the end of 2019, a new regime with regard to direct award will come into play.  We believe we will be well placed from the competitive perspective to manage any competition that will arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900004#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404895800,"counter":883,"content":"<p>I apologise as I have to leave the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900005#J00200","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1404895800,"counter":884,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for coming before the committee and I thank him for serving on the board of Bus &Eacute;ireann since April 2013.  With regard to feedback, I never had a complaint about the Expressway service.  It is an efficient service and I have used it.  It is welcome that further investment will be made in the service.  Are there plans to utilise smart technology to inform customers or attract more customers to the services?  A high percentage of people use smartphones and it would be beneficial to do so.  Wi-Fi is available on the Expressway service.  Using an app to inform customers about pick-ups, drop-offs and cost helps to attract more customers.  Comfort and the adequacy of the service is also important.<\/p><p>  I refer to the PSO service.  There are major challenges for Bus &Eacute;ireann and nationally as regards our public transport service.  Public buses in our cities have been heavily subsidised, which is also the case internationally where public transport is provided in cities.  There is a global subsidy.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy can explain how we compare with other cities internationally.<\/p><p>  I come from Waterford, some of whose services are run by private operators and are not subsidised.  There is controversy with the rest of the services in Waterford city being put out to tender as part of the 10% put out to tender by the NTA.  Is Mr. Murphy confident that Bus &Eacute;ireann can compete for the services when they are put out to tender in 2016?  Are there challenges he envisages in trying to win the services?<\/p><p>  I do not hear concerns from the public, as the public only wants an efficient public transport service.  It is not a major concern of the public who provides the service.  There is loyalty to Bus  &Eacute;ireann and I would like to see the company compete.  I would like to hear the views of Mr. Murphy on this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900005#J00300","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404895800,"counter":885,"content":"<p>With regard to the Expressway service, I can confirm that we are making significant changes to the ICT system to be able to manage the apps to which the Deputy refers.  At the start of the year we appointed a chief commercial officer, who was working very hard to bring into play the modern technology that gives customers up-to-date information and make travelling on the Expressway service more streamlined.  Members may have noticed some of our new coach livery on the Expressway service, which is being rolled out.  New vehicles are coming into the fleet at the end of this year and the start of next year, and people will see a higher level of service.  It is our aim to provide the best level of service on the Expressway routes and to compete with other operators to provide a seamless, modern and efficient transport system.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is correct in respect of the PSO in that we are in a competitive situation.  We accept and understand it and we accept that the customer is interested in the service and does not care a great deal about who provides it.  Having said that, there is a degree of brand loyalty to Bus &Eacute;ireann because it operates in almost every parish in the country.  The closeness to the community gives loyalty to the brand that is different to other operators.  On the one hand, we want to retain that, but on the other, we want to be as competitive as we can in providing services that customers demand.  At the same time, we must respect the taxpayer.  If the subvention is reduced, it is taxpayers' funds and we must be conscious of it.<\/p><p>  I cannot provide the figures from other jurisdictions on subsidies.  In most jurisdictions there is a certain level of subsidisation for services.  With over 4 million inhabitants on the island, we have over 11 million vehicles.  This amounts to approximately 4,000 citizens per vehicle on the road.  Taking out the large conurbation of Dublin and spreading the remainder over the country, this gives an idea of the sparse population areas we must deal with in terms of the PSO.  If we want to provide a certain level of service, there is a cost.  We must either transparently decide what is the cost and how it will be funded or decide that we will not provide the service.  We will be as competitive as we can but there is a danger in going to a range of competitive situations.  We have seen this in the airline industry.  Many operators came into the airline industry to provide lower fares and many of them went out very quickly.  There must be a sustainable business model that works in the longer term.  We must recognise that if we want a level of service to satisfy the needs of rural Ireland, and Bus &Eacute;ireann is in favour of that, we must be transparent about its cost and how that cost is allocated.  That is why we are working closely with the NTA to provide a level of service, to increase services where we can and to increase frequency, increase journeys and put the focus on the customer.  There is a cost to this and we must recognise that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900005#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1404895800,"counter":886,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy.  Like Deputy Timmy Dooley, I agree that Mr. Murphy's experience and qualifications render him suitable for the post of chairman of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is a trusted and well-regarded company, which goes a long way for any business.  I foresee risks facing the company in terms of the privatisation of routes, particularly where companies can cherry-pick the more profitable routes.  Can Mr. Murphy comment on this?<\/p><p>  The presentation referred to Bus &Eacute;ireann operating three businesses within one entity, PSO services, commercial services and school transport schemes.  I understand why school transport is shown separately but I do not understand why PSO urban, commuter and rural transport is shown separately from commercial services.  It might be regarded as a fatalistic acceptance that we cannot have commercially viable services in urban or rural areas.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy can tease out that point.<\/p><p>  Every Deputy receives representations from parents about some of the rigid rules of the Department of Education and Skills with regard to the school transport service.<\/p> <p>I am sure drivers, inspectors and people in the field hear this from parents also.  Is there an opportunity for Mr. Murphy's people to sit down with the Department of Education and Skills to talk through how it is working, the disappointment for some parents and students and some of what appear to be fairly silly things where a bus drives by somebody's house but the person has to travel in order to get the bus?  Is there the opportunity for that sort of discussion in order to fine tune the service and make it a bit more sensible?<\/p><p> Is the &euro;0.4 million surplus after provision for fleet replacement and upgrade or is there a totally separate capital expenditure heading for fleet replacement and upgrade?  <\/p><p> What time commitment does Mr. Murphy envisage will be required of him in order to fulfil this role?

We want to be very transparent about our operation.  The Expressway service is a commercial operation and it should, and will, make a profit to generate further funds for investment, and I will come back to that in a moment.<\/p><p>  In discussions with the NTA, the regulator, we need to be able to clearly show the PSO services and how that is structured.  It is not a fatalistic view but rather about being transparent with the NTA about how we are managing our business so there is clarity about where the subvention is going and what it is being used for.  We would want to get into further discussions with the NTA about further clarity in that regard in order to demonstrate that certain routes will require certain levels of subvention which comes back to the question about cherry-picking.  <\/p><p>  There is a real danger routes could be cherry-picked.  Obviously, we will want to compete with any other service providers to manage to get those routes because we believe we have built up an expertise and an involvement with the community that will help us.  However, if one cherry-picks all of the profitable routes, one is left with a number of routes which will require even greater subvention, so there is a balancing act there.  At the moment, the subvention is one sum of money for the PSO operation.  It does not follow the particular routes where a greater element of subvention is necessary.  Maybe that is what will happen in time.  One must recognise that certain routes might be desirable from a social point of view but from a cost point of view, they are very significant in terms of subvention cost.  It is purely from the point of view of transparency and how we face into the future restructured direct award situation that we want to be clear about that.<\/p><p>  In regard to school transport, the Deputy is right that there is a lot of dialogue between Bus &Eacute;ireann, as the provider, and the Department of Education and Skills.  The Department of Education and Skills lays down the rules and regulations in regard to how it should operate and we operate it on its behalf.  Having said that, our staff have regular updates with the Department, they feed back any information we have and any of the feedback we get from our inspectors on the ground and so on.  I could not tell the Deputy definitely but I understand from presentations made to the board, there is quite a degree of understanding on both sides and, as a result, changes which both sides believe are necessary are then implemented.  However, I could not give the Deputy chapter and verse on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900006#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1404896400,"counter":889,"content":"<p>Mr. Murphy feels it is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900006#K00300","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404896400,"counter":890,"content":"<p>I feel it is there.<\/p><p>  In regard to the capital investment, the &euro;400,000 is actually our net profit at the end of last year.

I know Dublin Bus has an app because I live in a Dublin constituency where somebody standing at a bus stop can find out what time the next bus is due by using an app.  Does Bus &Eacute;ireann have a similar type of app?

For the total kilometerage we are doing, that is really high.  I am not saying it is unacceptable but, for example, it is at the level where we are beginning to experience significant overruns in some of our maintenance costs this year.  At the end of the day, it is like kicking the can down the road.  If one delays decisions like that, it starts to pop up at a later stage and then it affects one's profitability in later years, which affects one's ability to reinvest.  One has to confront these things as one goes along.  Obviously, because we have been through a very difficult period of time over the past number of years, decisions have been made to put off some of the reinvestment decisions but we are moving back towards reinvestment and we hope over a period of time to bring the average age down.<\/p><p>  We have apps.  For example, one can now use an app on one's mobile telephone.  If one buys a ticket online, one can use an app to scan through as one boards the bus.  However, we are developing further refinements, which will be very interesting going forward.  <\/p><p>  In regard to moving people from their own transport to public transport, there are a number of things one has to do.  It has to be cost effective.  Congestion is beginning to reappear in the greater Dublin area.  For example, our drivers are experiencing congestion starting to creep back in once they reach the outskirts of the greater Dublin area.  That is delaying some of the transit times.  One has to be able to convince commuters that there is a better and a more relaxed way to travel where they can do some work using WiFi and read the newspapers.  They will want a modern fleet with facilities, efficiency of service and connectivity.  They will want to be sure that if they arrive at a bus stop at 7.20 a.m., the bus will be there and not at 7.19 a.m. or 7.21 a.m.  Being able to rely on the service is key for people who have busy lives.  Obviously, there is some discomfort in bad weather but we believe all the other benefits outweigh using one's own car to come into the city, in particular. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900006#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1404896400,"counter":894,"content":"<p>If it is okay, we will take questions from Deputies Harrington and Griffin and Senator Sullivan together as we are under time constraints.

We will have the discussions with the NTA on how the PSO services develop.  There is an element that if one can manage the fares process correctly, one might be able to gain further passengers on buses, which would reduce the cost.<\/p><p>  As I said earlier in response to another question, the spread of the population does not always give Bus &Eacute;ireann the opportunity to be able to run certain routes on an efficient basis.  If one wants to run routes to fill a social dimension, there is a cost element to that.  The cost element will either be in individual fares paid by the consumer on the day or by increased subvention which is paid through taxes.  There is a balance and that is something for Government to discuss and on which to make decisions.  We will obviously have an input into the NTA and develop as best we can the most competitive model.  If we are as competitive as possible then that should start to reduce the need for fare increases.<\/p><p>  I am very clear on industrial relations.  As far as I am concerned if one has a fully engaged and committed workforce, industrial relations issues can always be dealt with.  That is not to say there are no challenges for the company ahead.  We have had a great many discussions with our employees in the past period of time and we recognise and understand they have taken some pain in their wage levels and so on.  That is necessary if the company is to survive going into the future.  The most important point is that employees understand the strategy, and the reason for it in a very transparent way and what I have found from my experience is that employees will actual move with the company in that regard.  One is better to do that, talk up-front, be honest and clear with employees, they will come in the main with the company.  We have been rolling out our strategic plan and doing employee engagement surveys to gauge how our employees feel, whether they feel engaged by the company.  We have more than 2,500 employees spread across the country and communications can be an issue because of the spread of the employee base.

Of course, there is always room for improvement and to do things better.  My contacts with Bus &Eacute;ireann, employees and with the company representatives have always been very positive.<\/p><p>  I have three questions about savings, areas where more money could be spent and technology.  Has Mr. Murphy and his team considered the new technology in terms of fuel efficiency devices that can be fitted to HGVs and buses that will reduce the fuel consumption levels by up to 10% in some cases?  Obviously the fuel bill for buses must be enormous and anything that could reduce it will produce significant savings for the company.  Has Mr. Murphy considered this or would he consider it if he was to be pointed in the right direction?<\/p><p>  If the company were achieving savings in this area, it might be able to spend more money on bus shelters.  I appreciate they are expensive, that the company must apply for planning permission and that the process takes time.  The bus shelter in Killorglin will be ready shortly but I remember campaigning for it in 2002 when I was a student and people have been waiting for 12 years since then.  We live in a very wet climate and in towns and villages throughout the country there are no shelters.  Is it possible that Mr. Murphy will be able to focus more on this?  I am not suggesting that we erect similar shelters to those in urban areas in rural towns and villages but a very tasteful shelter has been put in place in Dingle with the theme of an upturned currach forming the roof.  One can use other materials rather than plastic and glass.  A bus shelter would prevent customers getting wet while waiting for buses.<\/p><p>  Transport apps have changed things significantly.  How does Mr. Murphy envisage Bus &Eacute;ireann moving forward on that front in the next number of years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900007#L00300","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1404897000,"counter":898,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy O'Sullivan, I am sorry, Senator Ned O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900007#L00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1404897000,"counter":899,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the promotion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900007#L00500","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1404897000,"counter":900,"content":"<p>As the Senator knows, it is a day of promotions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900007#L00600","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1404897000,"counter":901,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Murphy and thank him for appearing before the committee.  As a Kerryman, I agree in the main with what Deputy Griffin had to say about the effectiveness of the service in our county.  I have a particular bugbear, which I raised recently in the Seanad, but without any great satisfaction.  Let me recount this little anecdote, to which I invite Mr. Murphy to respond.  A friend of mine got the train from Heuston Station to Casement Station in Tralee and wanted to continue his journey to Listowel, a distance of about 18 miles.  The train and bus stations share a common yard.  He found, having come off the train, that the bus had left for Listowel about five minutes earlier.  The next bus would come in several hours time so he got a taxi to Listowel, which cost him more than the train fare from Dublin.  He subsequently contacted Bus &Eacute;ireann to complain but he was told that Bus &Eacute;ireann does not run a connecting service.  Is there any way that the bus and train service could be tailored to the needs of those who use both forms of transport?  It is not good for business for Bus &Eacute;ireann if customers off the train must take a taxi when a better timetable would enable people to go from train to bus, which one would expect to be the norm?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900007#L00700","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404897000,"counter":902,"content":"<p>On the question of savings from fuel efficiency, as I said earlier, we are investing in a new fleet and during the procurement process we looked at the best method consistent with new EU regulations on engines and so on to maximise the efficiency of the vehicles.

One can use those telematics to see what the best driving patterns are and then start educating drivers about them.  That system has been used in other companies in which I have been involved.

They are no longer specific to Bus &Eacute;ireann, although some of them are specifically Bus &Eacute;ireann shelters.  We have been in dialogue with the NTA about the provision of further bus stops, bus shelters and real-time passenger information.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to attend the committee meeting today.  My intention is to tell the committee a bit about myself and my background, reflect on the past three years as chairperson of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and set out my plans for the company and the board for the next three years, should I have the privilege of being reappointed. <\/p><p>  I was born in Glasgow 66 years ago, brought up in the east end of the city, and educated by the Marist Brothers and through the Glasgow Education Department's school system.  I joined British Railways in August 1965 on a five-year engineering student training scheme and attained a higher national certificate in electrical and electronics engineering at Glasgow College of Technology.  On completion of this training scheme, I was appointed to various roles in the delivery of re-signalling schemes in Scotland and London, most notably the major rationalisation of Kings Cross station.<\/p><p>  In 1977, I joined the Hong Kong mass transit railway corporation as a train control and signalling engineer for the construction of the original line of the network.  Over the following 28 years with the Hong Kong MTR, I held a variety of engineering and operations management positions including chief engineer and operations director.  My final position was as managing director, operations and business development.  When I left Hong Kong in December 2005, the network had grown to five lines, carrying 2.5 million passengers on a daily basis and was the most intensively used, most reliable and most profitable metro in the world.<\/p><p>  In 2000, I was part of the executive management team which successfully launched the company on the Hong Kong stock market.  From 2002, I was the director responsible for developing and implementing an international business strategy, which now sees Hong Kong MTR operating in London, Stockholm and Melbourne, as well as Beijing and other Chinese cities.<\/p><p>  In December 2005, I retired from Hong Kong MTR and relocated to west Cork where I still live.  I was fortunate to be appointed to the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann board as a non-executive director, a position I held for just over five years.  In July 2011, I was appointed non-executive chair in the revised CIE group and companies governance structure.<\/p><p>  In addition, I am a non-executive director of Crossrail, London, the largest railway infrastructure project in Europe.  Through my own company, Phil Gaffney Consulting Ltd., I provide advisory services at board and senior management level to a variety of railway industry companies and authorities.  Currently, I am advising the New South Wales Government on the introduction of the first rapid transit railway line in Sydney.<\/p><p>  Since I became chair of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in 2011, the overriding challenges have continued to be financial.  The board, management and staff have worked to address these.  We have suffered an unprecedented reduction in income, primarily in the form of public service obligation or PSO payments, but also through lower passenger revenue.  While reducing our cost base, which we have done to the tune of &euro;73 million over the past five years, we have operated an expanded network with three new lines opening as well as a number of new stations.<\/p><p>  We have also seen a significant reduction in the amount of capital funding available to us by 75% over five years.  Therefore, not only have programmes to expand our capabilities and capacities come to a halt, but this has also reduced the volume of essential renewals and overhaul to infrastructure and rolling stock.<\/p><p>  We have delivered efficiencies, reduced our staff numbers to their lowest level ever, reduced overtime, made savings through re-tendering services and contracts, and improved our fleet efficiency.  In addition, we have implemented lean management techniques which have seen other railways from around the world coming to Ireland to learn from our practices.  At the same time we have increased the service levels we provide to our customers as measured by passenger train kilometres, while maintaining an excellent safety performance. <\/p> <p> On the issue of safety, I should note that last night we had the first ever derailment of a DART train, just south of Bray.  Fortunately, the 33 passengers on board and the driver were not injured.  It is clear that the derailment occurred due to the train striking a coping stone from a wall above the railway which had been dislodged in what appears to have been a deliberate act.  We are working closely with the Garda to seek out who was responsible for this act.  Actions such as this are extremely serious and reprehensible and, in this case, could have resulted in fatalities among passengers and staff.  <\/p><p> In the past three years we have delivered efficiencies and implemented on schedule the internal reorganisation of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann required under European Union regulations which had previously been the subject of a derogation for Ireland.  This included the establishment of separate railway undertaking  - a train operations organisation - and infrastructure manager organisations within Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  We have improved customer facilities, including the provision of free Wi-Fi and online resources.  We have become more commercially and customer focused and commenced the Customer First programme which will be central to ensuring strong customer relationship management and dynamic yield management, among many other benefits.<\/p><p> At board level, I have introduced changes to our financial reporting and procurement processes which have resulted in greater transparency at all levels of the organisation and improved procurement of services and contracts to the benefit of our suppliers.  This has also provided greater protection for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann staff and value for money for our funders. <\/p><p> Thankfully, we are seeing recovery in the numbers travelling with us across all passenger services, as well as growth and new business opportunities in the freight business.  We have met and exceeded punctuality and reliability statistics under the public service obligation contract with the National Transport Authority and, most crucially, operated safely.  This has all been achieved while reducing our cost per kilometre by 20% in the past three years and a cumulative 33% in the past five years.  Notwithstanding this, the position of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann remains extremely critical.  We are seeking to agree a series of pay and productivity measures with our workforce, including a temporary forgoing of pay increases for a period of 20 months, with the sums involved ranging from 1.7% to 6.1%.  The senior management team and board, including me, have already implemented these proposals in our own terms.  Alone, however, these changes will not be enough - far from it.<\/p><p> That brings me to the challenges and my vision and plans for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in the next three years.  This will be a period which will determine the role railways will play in the future of transport in Ireland for the coming generations.  Today, resulting from the reduction in PSO payments of almost 40% from what was already one of the lowest levels of PSO payment in Europe and reduced capital funding, the current network we manage and service levels we deliver are not sustainable and there is a real threat to the solvency of the organisation.  We must grow our revenues further.  Working with the CIE Group, the Minister, the Department and the National Transport Authority, we must determine if the current network and services are to be supported adequately, from infrastructure to fleet maintenance to all service operations. <\/p><p> Investment is required in the national rail network.  Unlike the bus companies or Luas, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the infrastructure on which its services operate.  In this regard, agreement on a new multi-annual contract in respect of rail infrastructure is absolutely imperative to secure the future of the railways in Ireland.  Capital funding is required to maintain our rolling stock fleet at its current standard.  We have transformed the quality of the trains on which our customers travel, moving from the oldest train fleet in western Europe to the youngest, through significant investment in the period from 2000 to 2010.  If we are to ensure the return to the taxpayer from the significant investment in the fleet, we cannot allow these assets to deteriorate.  If it is decided not to invest, to sustain safe and reliable operations, the extent of our current network will have to be reviewed.  Also, initiatives which require expanded operations must be adequately funded for the whole-of-life cost.  The position is that stark and I am focused on working with all stakeholders in ensuring there is an understanding of the issues we face and we emerge a stronger and more sustainable organisation. <\/p><p> There is a strong role for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in meeting the transport needs of the country - in urban areas and nationally.  We can generate a return for the economy, for instance, by connecting Dublin Airport to the rail network and expanding the DART network, including DART underground, to effect a significant modal shift from private to more sustainable public transport.  There is scope for improving speeds on the network to reduce journey times and improve our service offering and competitive position.  While the challenges are great, the opportunities can be greater still.  I look forward, therefore, to the opportunity of working with the board, management and staff of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in meeting these challenges and opportunities and providing our customers with transport solutions which are safe, service oriented and sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900008#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Gaffney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404898200,"counter":913,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gaffney for his stark presentation which contained a number of red flags.  It is informative to hear about his success in Hong Kong and elsewhere and the significant challenges facing Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  He referred to a substantial reduction in the amount of capital funding available to the company.  A reduction of 75% over five years is significant in any industry.

My presentation was stark because that is the reality.  We will not compromise safety as that is our primary responsibility.

I am a professional railway man and have been for more than 40 years and I am not in the business of closing railway lines but am seeking to open them if at all possible.  We are carrying out a detailed review with the NTA and will be going back to the Department on the outcome of that review, laying out the options for funding models for the network.  Each line will be looked at in terms of inputs and outputs. That work is ongoing and will continue for some time.  However, if that funding level is not sustainable both in terms of safety and reliability and from the financial aspect we will have to look at the service being provided.  There is no plan B.  Nothing has been identified as yet and I hope that will not come about.<\/p><p>  The operating cost per kilometre is a good measure of efficiency not necessarily driven by cuts but it is also a measure of the return on investment which was made in the late 1990s and 2000 in new trains, removing level crossings and some resignalling.

Queries and problems arise all the time around the manning of stations and security on the DART at night, what can happen at weekends in Howth when many people descend on the area, many carrying alcohol and how that is to be managed.  I am aware of private security on the DART and that sometimes the assistance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is required.  That is a problem that needs to be managed, especially when people, particularly women, may feel afraid getting off an unmanned station late at night.  These are issues that need to be addressed.  Much of this is down to anti-social behaviour which is outside the control of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Gaffney mentioned what happened in Bray this morning and said he thought it was a deliberate act that somebody had caused a derailment.  Unfortunately, those types of actions happen.  Currently there is also a problem with people stealing overhead cables for the metal content.  That is dangerous because somebody will get electrocuted if they continue to do that.  These are the problems that arise on the DART which provides an outstanding service to commuters.  I travelled on it this morning.

Having listened to his presentation, I would describe Mr. Gaffney as an enthusiast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900011#P00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404899400,"counter":926,"content":"<p>Passionate and professional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900011#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Gaffney"},{"type":"speech","time":1404899400,"counter":927,"content":"<p>That is reassuring.  As other members mentioned, Mr. Gaffney's presentation demonstrated typical Glasgow, brutal honesty and paints a difficult scenario if  options are not taken to support the networks.  As he is aware, since the 1950s we no longer have a rail network in west Cork and can see the lost opportunities now because of the decisions taken then.<\/p><p>  If Mr. Gaffney is faced with no choice but to review the network and consider line or station closures, how will he deal with that difficult prospect?  Such a decision would not be popular.  Will he give his views on the possibility of increasing or decreasing rail fares?  The figures published in the past few days regarding increasing passenger numbers throughout the network are encouraging.  In light of the challenges facing the company, how will Mr. Gaffney deal with industrial relations?<\/p><p>  About this time last year, the train accident occurred in Galicia.  Unfortunately, I had the misfortune to see that carnage at first hand.  Has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann considered what lessons could be learned from that accident?  I know the full investigation process has not been gone through in regard to that accident, but I presume Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has considered what lessons might be learned and how it might avoid such issues occurring here.<\/p><p>  One issue that has arisen in regard to passenger numbers relates to the management of events.  I hope Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has not factored in certain concerts this summer as part of its business plan for 2014 and hope we do not see fare increases as a result of the cancellation of some events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900011#P00400","speaker":"995"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1404899400,"counter":928,"content":"<p>Deputy John O'Mahony resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1404899400,"counter":929,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gaffney for his presentation.  I concur with Deputy Harrington in regard to Mr. Gaffney's background and experience.  It is great to see someone with passion along with professional knowledge in his area of expertise.<\/p><p>  I have a serious concern in regard to the incident in Bray last night.  It is appalling that this was done deliberately.  This could have been catastrophic and the headlines today could be very different.  I support Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's and Garda efforts to bring those responsible to justice.<\/p><p>  I commend Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on being one of the only groups or organisations to have shown common sense and decency this week in regard to what it has done in regard to the cancelled concerts.  From a public relations point of view, it was a positive move by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to refund fares and I hope this is acknowledged widely.  It has been well reported in the media and was a wise and decent move and demonstrates the only common sense we have seen on the issue this week.  Fair play to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Harrington touched on the issue of fares.  There is some excellent value where tickets are purchased online.  However, sometimes people have to make a journey at short notice and fares in that case can be very expensive.  Also, people may not be able to make an online booking within a few hours of their travel time and feel they are being fleeced when they go to the station.  Is this an issue Mr. Gaffney may tackle?  I appreciate there are extra costs associated with booking at stations, but high fares leave a sour taste.  Will Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann consider more flexibility in the case where somebody has booked on line but needs to get an earlier train?  Generally they have to pay extra to change.<\/p><p>  In regard to the long term, what is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's vision in regard to cutting journey time on inter city and longer distance routes?  I acknowledge significant work has been done on this in recent years, but how will the reduced journey times be achieved?  Will this require better stock or will it require track infrastructure to be improved?  Are there other areas I may not be aware of, such as signalling or crossings, that require improvement?  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann must compete with our new and ever expanding motorway network, and hopefully in ten or 20 years cities like Cork and Limerick will be linked up.  The possibility of making the journey quickly by car will make it difficult to justify the expense of taking the train.  How will Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann deal with that?<\/p><p>  Recently, a friend of mine contacted me about the DART app, which is giving wrong information about the last DART trains leaving Connolly Station.  Will Mr. Gaffney check this out?  Apparently, the app tells people there is a train at \"X\" time, but the last train time is before that.  This happened last Monday and I received a call on Tuesday about it.  <\/p><p>  On a local issue, there is an ongoing issue in regard to the level crossing at Stagmount in Kerry, between Rathmore and Killarney.  The situation there between local residents and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is at an impasse and local residents are aggrieved.  Will Mr. Gaffney give this issue his personal attention to try to breach the impasse?  If I can assist in that, I will be happy to do so.  The issue is causing significant grief and surely a common sense solution can be found.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900011#P00600","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speech","time":1404899400,"counter":930,"content":"<p>Following on Deputy Griffin's query, I presume Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann constantly reviews services, pricing and the frequency of services in line with consumer needs.  How often does such review take place or is it continuous?  People may need to get to work by 8 a.m., but a train may not arrive at its destination until 8.10 a..m.  Are issues such as this - frequency and timetables - constantly reviewed in order to encourage new passengers?<\/p><p>  I am aware that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann tries to encourage as much online booking as possible.  I would like to give some constructive criticism in this regard that I hope Mr. Gaffney will take on board.

However, for some reason the online booking facility would not allow me tick the box for the return journey.<\/p> <p>I submitted an online query to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's customer service four days ago which said it would respond as soon as possible.

We are carrying out a very detailed review, line by line, and will have a range of options.  Closure of a line is the absolute last option.  We have nothing of that kind on the table.  We are considering reducing services if the public service obligation, PSO, does not match what is required.  I have said, and it has been agreed, that it would be done in an integrated way, particularly with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  If a gap is created, we should work with our colleagues in Bus &Eacute;ireann to try to improve that.  There is nothing on the table regarding any options for closure, but if we must proceed to considering adjustments, we should do so in an integrated way.<\/p><p>  Deputies Harrington and Griffin mentioned decreasing fares.  We are not in a position to consider reducing our revenue.  Total revenue is a combination of volume and price and we are very actively trying to get that balance right.  There is quite a difference between the DART and commuter lines and inter-city services.  The DART and commuter line fares are relatively inflexible.  Many people using them have significant benefits arising from the tax saver option.  We have been very aggressive in setting fares for inter-city services.  The &euro;9.99 promotion is a good example.  One area of investment is the customer first programme which will give us much greater ability to adjust fares to meet demand and to be more flexible in how we price our fares, which will answer some of Deputy Griffin&rsquo;s questions.<\/p><p>  While it is of no comfort to those who have to shell out the money, our fares are very low by European standards.  When one compares similar journeys, for example, Drogheda to Dublin and Luton to London, our fare is one-third of the UK fare, when one takes tax saver into account.  We could be much smarter about how we structure our fares.  The customer first programme will give us more tools to do that.<\/p><p>  Industrial relations are not particularly challenging.  In my time as chairman we have had a very committed workforce which generally enjoys coming to work every day and doing its best for the company.  It has taken a hit on take-home pay, as has management.  In all our discussions with staff and unions we have insisted, and I encourage it at board level, through the work of directors, that we continue the dialogue and that we never stop talking.  We have a cost containment committee chaired by the chief executive, and the unions are members of that.  That committee examines every single line of expenditure, except payroll.<\/p><p>  We analyse every major incident that happens overseas, such as the Spanish derailment, get what information we can and consider it in respect of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  We require investment.  A programme has been identified for automatic train protection, which would have prevented that accident.  A pilot scheme for that will take place later this year.  This is one of the areas of capital funding which I hope will come through in the years to come.<\/p><p>  We treat special events as windfall, and they are not, thank God, factored into our budget.  I thank the Deputy for his comments on our response, which was entirely appropriate to the cancelled concerts and the refund.<\/p><p>  We have reduced inter-city journey times and are trying to reduce them further.  We hope that within this year we will be able to introduce at least one express train, a morning train from Cork to Heuston which will do the journey in two hours.  We do not require any investment in trains or signalling, but to sustain a two-hour journey, including the current stopping pattern, would require investment in track to get it up to the level required for higher speeds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900012#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Gaffney"},{"type":"speech","time":1404900000,"counter":934,"content":"<p>What is the current journey time from Cork to Dublin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900012#Q00400","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404900000,"counter":935,"content":"<p>It is 2.5 hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900012#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Philip Gaffney"},{"type":"speech","time":1404900000,"counter":936,"content":"<p>The new one would be two hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900012#Q00600","speaker":"1051"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404900000,"counter":937,"content":"<p>Yes two hours would make quite a difference.

I have served as chairman of CIE since July 2011 and am honoured that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has nominated me to continue in the role for a second three-year term.  Along with my colleagues in the CIE subsidiaries, we were the first appointees to the chairmanship of a State-owned body to present to an Oireachtas committee under the new arrangements back in 2011.  In that context, I will briefly summarise my career history before focusing on the challenges and achievements of the past three years and the future challenges for and ambitions of the CIE group of companies.<\/p><p>  My background is that I have a bachelor of commence degree and a masters in business studies from UCD.  I have worked full-time in business since I graduated and had a 32-year career with Accenture, the global leader in consulting, technology and outsourcing.  I started my working life as a management consultant and worked with many organisations across various industry sectors and Government Departments in Ireland.  During that time, I led and delivered a succession of successful technology-enabled business change initiatives in both public and private organisations, initiatives which drove business success for those organisations.  I was elected an Accenture partner in 1988 - the first woman in Europe to reach that level in the company.  I ran Accenture's public service business in Ireland for several years prior to being promoted to my first role outside Ireland within the Accenture global network.  I held operational managing director responsibility for profit and loss divisions at Irish, European and global levels.  I spent the latter 12 years of my career with Accenture as a global executive director reporting to the global CEO.<\/p><p>  I chaired the tourism recovery taskforce between 2011 and 2013 and led the development of the Great Britain Path to Growth strategy.  This enshrined a new way of looking at and driving business from our key markets.  In 2014, we have seen significant growth in visitor numbers - particularly from Britain, which is our largest market.  My experience as a management consultant working in diverse industries enables me to understand CIE and the things that must be done exceedingly well if we are to succeed in achieving our vision.  <\/p><p>  CIE's vision is aligned to its statutory mandate, which is to provide socially necessary bus and rail transport in a well-functioning, integrated manner which contributes to balanced regional economic development and social cohesion at a reasonable cost.  CIE has devolved certain of these functions to its three operating subsidiaries, namely, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Strategic direction, control and overall co-ordination is provided by CIE, but each subsidiary and business unit has a high degree of operating autonomy in its day-to-day business.  CIE also owns CIE Tours, an innovative and highly respected tour operator in North America, the UK and mainland Europe.  Indeed, CIE Tours is the largest single generator of inbound tour customers to Ireland  from North America.  The CIE holding company provides centrally a number of services that support the transport companies in their day-to-day operations.  These include treasury, IT, property and legal-investigations services, as well as the management of the commuter advertising network contract. <\/p><p>  In the early stages of my term as CIE chairman, it became apparent that the group was in the midst of what the Minister described at the time as a \"perfect storm\", arising from the cumulative effect of reduced Exchequer funding, reduced demand as a result of the severe decline in economic activity domestically, and increased fuel costs.  My absolute priority was to help guide CIE through that storm, working with my board, the chairmen and boards of the subsidiaries, the management teams, the Minister and Minister of State with responsibility for public transport, and key stakeholders.  In all our efforts to deliver reforms, we also kept in mind the needs of our customers.<\/p><p>  It is incumbent on me to point out that the cumulative reduction in Exchequer-funded public service obligation, PSO, payments to the CIE group since the onset of the economic crisis in 2007 is more than &euro;110 million, or 35%.  To put this in context, funding in that period to the health sector has declined by just over 10%, to education by 9%, and to the Garda and the defence budget by 16%.  CIE and its subsidiaries continue to play their part in trying to solve the equation of delivering the same level of public transport services on this reduced level of PSO funding.  Much of what we have achieved in this regard has been delivered through additional efficiencies in work practices and reduced payroll costs.  Now, as the economy recovers, there is a need to revisit what is an appropriate level of PSO funding for the services provided.  In very simple terms, it is not possible for CIE and its operating subsidiaries to continue delivering current service levels in return for the current level of PSO and capital funding.  This is especially so in the case of Irish Rail, as delegates have heard from Mr. Gaffney.  I very much welcome the opportunity to work with the Minister, Minister of State and the Department to try to solve this difficult issue.<\/p><p>  When the chief executive officers of the subsidiaries and I appeared before the committee last July, we outlined the immediate steps taken to address our cash issues in early 2012.  Additional actions we have taken include a continued focus on cost reduction, including the successful implementation of pay and productivity measures with staff in all three companies, with a further process concluding in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann; strengthened board committee oversight of cash management; improved central governance function over key financial risks; enhancing the central group finance function; developing an appropriate inter-company funding structure; and enhancement of information technology tools.  We are beginning to grow our business again, with an increase in passenger numbers recorded in 2013.  In fact, the group has exceeded ministerial targets to grow public transport users by 2% to date in 2014.  Crucially, we successfully completed negotiations on a five-year &euro;160 million bank facility with a consortium of banks, demonstrating objectively that the group is moving in the right direction in terms of creating a long-term financially sustainable business. <\/p><p>  Despite the challenges we face, CIE is maintaining its comprehensive network of services through its subsidiaries, which continue to facilitate travel to all corners of the country in line with the group's mandate.  In addition, CIE Tours had its best ever year in 2013, with revenues of &euro;67.9 million and almost 50,000 passengers - a record number for the business.  We continue to try to deliver a comprehensive level of services while receiving significantly less funding than in the past.  My priorities for CIE reflect the challenges we face and include managing the group's debt and liquidity positions; a continued focus on reducing the group's cost base at a time when there is extraordinary pressure on the public purse; improving co-ordination of critical areas of common interest, including risk management, HR initiatives and stakeholder engagement; and an ambitious target for CIE Tours to be the leading tour operator to Ireland and Britain.  It is important to note that the regulatory environment in which we operate removes control over many of the levers one might use in response to these challenges.  In particular, the setting of levels of funding, fares, routes and timetables are all within the remit of the National Transport Authority.<\/p><p>  A core responsibility of the CIE chairman is to ensure that our shareholder &ndash; namely, the Minister, as representative of the Irish people &ndash; is informed of the key strategic issues and challenges we face.  We have been open and transparent with the Minister, Minister of State and their departmental officials and ensured they have all the necessary information to make policy decisions in the extraordinarily difficult environment they and the wider Government are facing.<\/p> <p>I thank them for this support and am confident it will continue into the future.<\/p><p> In this regard we have been clear on the implications of the significant challenge of securing necessary capital investment by the Exchequer in public transport fleets and infrastructure.  To maintain the current standard of the public transport fleet and rail network it is a significant priority of mine to work with the Ministers and the Government to secure the necessary investment to ensure that the nation's transport infrastructure, which is so vital to the country's economic well-being and recovery, does not deteriorate.  This is a huge challenge for both the Government and CIE, given current constraints, and it includes the investment required by the national rail infrastructure network and the funding required to maintain the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann rolling stock fleet at its current standard.  Both of these issues were highlighted by Mr. Gaffney earlier today in greater detail.  In the period from 2014 to 2016 all indications suggest there will be an acute shortage of capital available to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to fund the up-front purchase of new bus fleets for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  To assist with the purchase of new fleets the NTA and CIE are exploring options around leasing.  While leasing may allow welcome investment in the bus fleets in that period, we must decide on a medium to long-term strategy for the funding for such investment.<\/p><p> Public transport facilitates a strong economy, environment and society.  We must ensure that it is equipped to meet the needs of our economy and society as they emerge from the unprecedented upheaval of the past seven years.  I look forward to working to ensure that public transport, as delivered by the CIE group of companies, is well equipped.  Should our appointments be confirmed we, the chairpersons, boards, management teams and staff, Ministers, Departments and the NTA, will work collectively to this end with the elected representatives of the people, to whom we are all ultimately answerable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900013#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Vivienne Jupp","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404901200,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I think I was here for the corresponding meeting last year, deputising for Deputy Ellis, who holds the transport brief, and here I am again.

I note with concern the flags raised by Ms Jupp on the sustainability of the Irish public transport system.  We must continually evaluate the arguments in this debate to see where our priorities lie.  I do not have particular questions because Ms Jupp has spelled out the challenges facing the company.  Regarding the alignment of the objectives of CIE, I presume there is constant engagement with stakeholders such as the NTA, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the workforce and the Minister.  When challenges arise and a business model for funding is formulated I presume change management is required and it is challenging to get the unions and the workforce to engage in the process.  Perhaps Ms Jupp can explain CIE's work in this area.<\/p><p>  What is the state of pension funds in the CIE group at the moment?

We cannot allow one company to do something that is detrimental to another.  The bus companies are concerned that we deal with the challenge facing Irish Rail because it could impact upon their services.  Since I took this job I have tried to be clear, concise and transparent in providing all of the necessary information to the board, which includes four worker directors, the management teams, the Department and the Minister.  I do not believe in hiding things.  We must be absolutely clear and transparent and ensure the evidence backing up our point of view is clearly communicated.  I always answer questions from the worker directors on the seriousness of the situation because nobody would want to put people through the changes we are asking people at all levels to undertake if the situation were not deadly serious.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900014#S00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Vivienne Jupp"},{"type":"speech","time":1404901200,"counter":956,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and compliment Ms Jupp on the work she has done at CIE.<\/p> <p> Ms Jupp's background is commerce and finance.  Does she foresee a greater restructuring of the entire CIE Group taking place in the near future in order that it might achieve the greatest possible efficiencies and obtain the strongest possible competitive advantage with regard to the delivery of public transport services?  There is not a country in the world whose public transport service does not operate without some form of state support or subvention.  The concern of the committee is that the subvention to CIE should be used to deliver efficiencies and a competitive and safe service.  In the context of its overall structure, is the group fit for that purpose?  Ms Jupp stated that there is competition both without and within the group.  Mr. Philip Gaffney outlined his aspiration in the context of reducing the journey time between Cork and Dublin to two hours.  Inevitably, that is going to have an impact on bus services.  Would there be some way of restructuring the entire group and perhaps of cutting parts of it loose, for want of a better phrase?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900014#S00800","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404901800,"counter":958,"content":"<p>The first point to make is that we always benchmark ourselves against international best practice in the areas in respect of which we can do so.  We also try to learn from best practice elsewhere.  There are international bodies which do this.  We contribute to them and receive information back.  This helps us to look at the services we provide and ensure that we operate them in the best possible way.  There are certain services which are consolidated within the group itself and which are not replicated in the individual companies.  That enables us to achieve some economies of scale across those services and to attract the skills that are required to operate those once rather than in three individual companies.  The thing we need to do an awful lot more of is look at the processes and procedures the individual companies - which would be doing similar things - use to run their businesses and determine the services they operate in order to discover whether these are delivering the best outcomes and establish whether we can do anything from a process re-engineering perspective to deliver better services in a more competitive way.  No matter what we have in terms of the money we receive from the PSO, the NTA, as the regulator, should always be demanding improved efficiencies and effectiveness from the organisations every year.  We would always need to do that and we must make a much better effort in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014070900015#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Vivienne Jupp"},{"type":"speech","time":1404901800,"counter":959,"content":"<p>Ms Jupp referred to benchmarking against international best practice.
