The Donegal project started mid-year and the Cork project started in the third quarter.  Both projects were internally evaluated by the HSE, which then commissioned an independent external assessment, undertaken by Trinity College Dublin. Data provided by the HSE in relation to the pilot evaluation period in Donegal from April to December 2011 indicates that a total of 8 calls were recorded. One call related to a child not being picked up from school, one an alleged rape and the remaining were categorised as 'other', including one public order concern. In three of the eight calls, the child was removed by Gardai under Section 12 of the Child Care Act, 1991. Data provided by the HSE in respect of the Cork pilot project from September 2011 to April 2012 indicates that 40 referrals were made to the service. Of these, Section 12 was invoked in 23 cases. Data in respect of monthly activity or in respect of repeat users of the service is not maintained by the HSE. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that at present the Health Service Executive provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the Crisis Intervention Service, and outside the greater Dublin area through the Emergency Place of Safety Service.<\/p><p>  The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years. The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow). Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Gardai, hospital and ambulance service personnel. <\/p><p>  In relation to activity data for the crisis intervention service, information provided by the HSE indicates that in 2009 there were 830 referrals to the service, of which 441 were males and 389 were female and that in 2010 there were 856 referrals to the service, of which 426 were males and 430 were female. In 2011 there were 1,076 referrals to the service, of which 179 individual young people accessed emergency accommodation, of whom 100 were male and 79 were female.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The Emergency Place of Safety Service, operates outside the greater Dublin area,  whereby Gardai can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out-of-hours. This service involves the placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case. As part of this service Gardai have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.<\/p><p>  As regards usage of the Emergency Place of Safety Service, which commenced in June 2009, information provided by the HSE indicates that in the period June to December 2009 the service received a total of 166 referrals, of which 66 led to a placement with the place of safety service. In 2010, a total of 288 referrals were received, of which 172 led to a placement. In 2011, a total of 369 referrals were received, of which 253 led to a placement and to date in 2012 the service has received 266 referrals, of which 186 have led to placements.<\/p><p>  In the light of the evaluation of the two pilot out of hours initiatives and experience with those other services mentioned above which operate outside normal working hours, the HSE has been asked to examine an appropriate model for the provision of out of hours social work services. Clearly this model will need to address the varying demographic demands in both rural and urban settings as highlighted by the pilot projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA00537","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Responsibilities","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA00540"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[56685\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA00543","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her top priorities for 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>My Department was set up to drive the delivery of key commitments in relation to children and young people.

A recent EU study to examine the safety of children on the internet found that 4% of children between the ages of 9 and 16 in Ireland experienced online bullying compared with an EU average of 6%. This finding is also supported by the &quot;Growing up in Ireland&quot; research which showed that 5% of 9 year olds experienced cyber-bullying.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Bullying and cyber-bullying can have a terrible and corrosive impact on our children and young people, on their confidence, learning outcomes, self-esteem and mental health.  The affects of bullying can last for years. Sadly, in some case they can result in the loss of young lives. In recent times we have learned of a number of very tragic cases where bullying was involved. On behalf of the Government and on my own behalf I wish extend my sympathies to the families and friends of the young people who have died.<\/p><p><br \/>  Cyber-bullying is, in most cases, simply an extension of bullying in other forms and other settings. However rather than simply extending bullying beyond the schoolyard, the internet has been used to amplify the venom of bullying. In seeking to respond to cyber-bullying, we should seek to start by addressing bullying in the round through a &#8216;whole-school-community&#8217; approach.<\/p><p>Parents have an important role to play here and I would hope that parents would take a more pro-active role in discussing with their children on their online activates in the same way the school day might be discussed. In recent weeks I have become aware that many schools and parents associations in community right around the country have arranged information events for parents on issues relating to internet safety and cyber-bullying. I wish to commend all involved in organising such and I would encourage other schools and parents associations to do likewise. I would remind all parents, teachers and young people that information on cyber-bullying is available at    which is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education.<\/p><p><br \/>  Last month I met with Simon Millner, Policy Director for Facebook in Ireland and the UK. I was impressed with the child-focussed and user-friendly safeguards and supports which Facebook have put in place to protect children and respond to concerns over cyber-bullying and inappropriate online behaviour. I subsequently arranged for the National Anti-Bullying Forum working group to meet with Facebook. However it is a matter of concern that certain other websites popular among Irish teenagers do not include the same safeguards. I refer in particular to website such as the &#8216;ask.fm&#8217; website which has come to attention in Ireland in recent weeks due to its use as a platform for cyber-bullying. While I have asked the Latvian authorities to investigate lack of safeguards applying to this website, I appreciate that given the global and open nature of the internet, options of regulation are constrained.<\/p><p><br \/>  Earlier this year the Minister for Education and Skills and I jointly hosted the first National Anti-Bullying Forum to bring relevant stakeholders together to consider the strategies and practices required to address bullying in schools and the new challenges associated with modern communication technologies.   Since then, a dedicated working group, on which my Department is represented, has been working to develop an action plan to effectively tackle bullying in schools. The group is examining the need for collaborative &#8216;whole-school-community&#8217; approach to addressing bullying which I have referred to.<\/p><p><br \/>   I understand the group expects to complete its work by end of year and it is envisaged that their final report will address issues including:<\/p><p>Updated anti-bullying guidelines for schools;<\/p><p>Supporting teachers and schools;<\/p><p>Enhanced awareness and information initiatives.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government has allocated &#8364;500,000 for anti-bullying measures in schools in the 2013 estimates for the Department of Education &amp; Skills.  My Department will also seek to support implementation of the report&#8217;s recommendations including engaging with parents&#8217; group and internet industry. It is my intention to ensure that the actions recommended by the Anti-Bullying Working Group and other measures to respond to bullying will be prioritised in the new Children &amp; Young People&#8217;s Policy Framework which is currently being prepared by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Aftercare Service","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[56769\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the report she has requested the National Director for Children and Family Services to prepare on aftercare provision, including best practice, assessment criteria and most effective aftercare supports has been completed; the date on which this will be published; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that I am currently examining options, in association with the Attorney General, to strengthen legislation to make explicit the HSE's obligations in the provision of aftercare. In this regard, the National Director for Children and Family Services in the HSE was asked to prepare a report on aftercare to guide the development of policy to underpin the strengthening of legislation for services in this important area. The HSE  responded to my Department at the end of November in relation to the key findings of the National Implementation Group and provided  information on the current provision of aftercare, assessment of need,  multi-agency working and the HSE policy regarding Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991, which provides that the HSE must take all reasonable steps to make suitable accommodation available to a child who is in need of accommodation. The response of the HSE provides an important update on the significant progress in developing aftercare supports, the development of greater consistency nationally and  the challenges in making supports available to individual young people, including the need for multi-agency cooperation and the need to take account of the views of those leaving care who, ultimately as young adults must wish to avail of the aftercare arrangements being made available.<\/p><p>  The HSE National Aftercare Service which is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document,  commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. An intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group, comprised of NGO groups representing aftercare, child advocacy, foster care and other groups, was established by the HSE to monitor progress in implementing the national policy.<\/p><p>  The HSE has reported on the key findings of the National Implementation Group's review of aftercare provision. The review has shown that there is now a more systematic approach to ensuring that young people around age sixteen are identified through the care planning review process for assessment and through care planning. A standardised aftercare planning template is now being utilised nationally and this approach is helping to identify young people with special needs, such as learning disabilities, earlier and has led to good examples of interagency working.   There have also been improvements in the statistical information available with additional new data being provided.While an aftercare service is provided across all areas, variations in how this is delivered and the level of aftercare allowances have been highlighted by the Group.<\/p><p>  Currently the annual spend on aftercare is &euro;17 million. The most recent information available indicates that there are 1,387 young people in aftercare, the majority of whom are aged 18-19 years. Most young people who were in foster care remain living with their foster carers supported financially by the HSE. Young people leaving residential care move into transitional accommodation, the private rental sector and supported lodgings. There are currently 42.2 whole time equivalent aftercare workers in the HSE, the majority  of whom are in the west, with the others distributed relatively evenly across the other three regions. In addition, the HSE commissions aftercare services from Focus Ireland, Don Bosco and Cross Care.<\/p><p>  The National Policy and Procedures Document sets out the eligibility criteria for an aftercare service. The care planing review process identifies young people as they approach 16 years and a process of assessment commences at that point, in conjunction with the wishes and views of the young person. Each individual is assessed across a number of areas, including life skills and capacity to live independently in the short and longer term; relationships with family, carers and significant others; emotional and behavioural development; health and overall wellbeing; identity and educational\/training requirements. <\/p><p>  The aftercare policy has a strong multi-agency dimension, which is particularly important in the context of the HSE Children and Family Services' transition to the Child and Family Support Agency. Protocols are being developed with Social Inclusion, Disability Services, Mental Health Services and Primary Care to support this approach. A protocol has been signed with the Irish Youth Justice Service which covers joint working arrangements for young people in Detention Schools. In addition, a protocol with the Housing Authorities which will set out a clear framework for identifying quality aftercare accommodation and commit local authorities to consider the needs of young care leavers is in the final stages of preparation. <\/p><p>  Clearly, there have been improvements in the delivery of aftercare service and the issue is under ongoing active consideration by the National Implementation Group. My officials will continue to engage with the HSE to ensure that the service is addressing the needs of these vulnerable young people. I am happy to share the HSE response with the Deputy and to discuss proposals for the further development of policy in this area when the latest information on both the current service provision and the legal provisions is fully considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Care Placements","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":72,"qnumall":"[56772\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the waiting time that applied in the cases of the three young persons who were approved and are awaiting a special care placement and the one young person approved and awaiting a high support placement on 23 October 2012; if those young persons had received their placements on 23 November 2012; the number of children awaiting placement in high support or special care unit residential places on 12 December 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>There are three  designated special care units in the country where children are detained on order of the high court for their own safety.

This initiative will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which has supported projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale.  Like the PEIP, it is also hoped to secure philanthropic funding for the new initiative.  In line with the Programme for Government commitment, the new programme will be adopt an area based approach to child poverty which draws on best international practice and existing services to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.<\/p><p>  In the coming months my Department will be working, in conjunction with the Office of the T&aacute;naiste and key Departments, to expand the number of project sites from 3 to 6 and to evaluate the relevance of existing interventions which have proven to be effective for national level programmes.  By 2015,  Exchequer funding for the initiative is expected to be in the region of &euro;4.75 million.<\/p><p>  The second initiative is the provision of  new After-School Childcare places to be managed jointly between my Department and the Department of Social Protection.   These places will be targeted at low-income families and supporting parents availing of employment opportunities.  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 quality after-school places for children attending primary school, as well as supporting parents to take up employment.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.<\/p><p>  The new childcare scheme will augment my Department's existing programme of childcare supports for low income families. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, together with the universal free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, available to all children in the relevant age group.  <\/p><p>  The After School places, as with those funded under the CETS and ECCE programmes, are expected to be available in both commercial and community providers.

Parents qualify where they are in receipt of social welfare payments or Family Income Supplement and where they hold a medical or GP card.  Parents qualifying for the top rate of subvention, of &#8364;95 per week for a full-day childcare place, have their childcare costs reduced by that amount.  Some 25,000 children are currently availing of subsidised childcare places under this programme. <\/p><p>The CETS<b><\/b>  programme is provided through both community and commercial childcare services and provides in the region of 2,500 full-time equivalent childcare places each year to trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.  Parents qualifying for places have their weekly childcare costs reduced by &#8364;145, in the case of a full time childcare place, and pro-rata amounts in the case of part-time or after school childcare.    <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, my Department implements the universal free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, under which all children have equal access to free pre-school education in the year before commencing primary school.  Some 65,000 children are currently availing of the ECCE programme at an annual cost of some &#8364;175 million.  Together, these programmes represent a significant investment in supporting parents with the cost of childcare and the fact that they have been maintained at a time of on-going need for reductions in Government expenditure, demonstrates this Government's commitment to supporting services for children and families.<\/p><p><br \/>  As part of Budget 2013, together with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, I was pleased to announce a new school age childcare initiative.  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &#8364;14 million to provide over 6,000 quality after-school places for children attending primary school, as well as supporting parents to take up employment.  This is an important further support measure as a lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families when seeking to avail of work and training or educational opportunities. <\/p><p><br \/>  By providing over 6,000 after-school childcare places, the initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and represents how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.<\/p><p><br \/>  Oficials in both my own Department and the Department of Social Protection are currently working to finalise the details of the scheme and its operational arrangements.  As is the case with the CETS scheme, the new scheme is expected to be open to both community and commercial childcare providers across the State and it is anticipated that places will become available on an interim basis from early 2013 with the full roll-out of the programme commencing in September 2013.  As soon as this work has been completed, further information will be  made available. <\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is currently developing a five year Children and Young People's Policy Framework.

As part of this overall Policy Framework, future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department and is expected to be completed by mid 2013.  This Strategy will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education and will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early years experience in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA01750"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[56688\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to develop a Scandinavian model of childcare here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[56764\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA01850","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her views on the proposed after school childcare scheme which falls short of calls for the development of a system of Scandinavian style childcare here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":35,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 92 together.<\/p><p>  As part of Budget 2013, together with my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, I was pleased to announce a new After-School Childcare initiative which will be targeted at low-income families and supporting parents availing of employment opportunities.<\/p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 quality after-school places for children attending primary school, as well as supporting parents to take up employment.

The necessary legislative and organisational preparations are being prioritised so that the CFSA can be established early in 2013. A precise target date for the transfer of staff will be set when consideration of the legislation is advanced.   From its establishment the Child and Family Support Agency will have service responsibility for:<\/p><p>- Child welfare and protection services currently operated by the HSE including family support and alternative care services.<\/p><p>- Child and family related services for which the HSE currently has responsibility including pre-school inspections and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.<\/p><p>- Community based psychology services as they relate to children and families services covered by the Child and Family Support Agency and to services provided by the HSE. With regard to psychology services my Department and the Department of Health are currently jointly undertaking an impact analysis of the proposed future arrangement.    <\/p><p>- The Family Support Agency which currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.<\/p><p>   - The National Educational Welfare Board which also currently operates as a separate body under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and will be merged into the new Agency.<\/p><p>  It is my intention that the CFSA will address the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation and consistency of service provision across the country particularly in the areas of child welfare and protection. At the same time, the CFSA will have a stronger role in supporting families - providing less complex, less intrusive, less expensive responses which have a preventive function.  In order to achieve genuine improvements for children and families, the CFSA will have a broad focus. Prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic and care interventions are all key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families based on identified need.<\/p><p>  Inclusion of the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board will also broaden  the professional, accessible, service and community based resources of the organisation which will assist in creating more holistic  and accessible approaches to support for children and families, particularly those that are most vulnerable. <\/p><p>  An amount of &euro;546 million has been allocated in the HSE vote for 2013 in respect of children and family services. This consists of &euro;545 million in current expenditure and &euro;1 million in capital. This level of budgetary provision for child welfare and protection services reflects the priority attached to the Government to this important area. The overall level of resources being provided will be increased further by the inclusion within the remit of the new agency of the budget of both the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. Some final adjustments to the budget provision are likely to be required to reflect the final service configuration of the Agency on completion of a due diligence exercise which is currently underway within the HSE and which is due to be completed prior to the establishment of the new agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foster Care","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA02150"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[56773\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800065#WRA02200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to rectify the situation whereby some children in foster care on reaching 18 years are then placed in the care of the Department of Justice even when their foster carers wish for them to remain in their care; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>The immediate and ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum (SCSA) as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991.

As a non-formal learning practice, youth work offers educational, developmental and recreational experiences which complement formal education and training. It provides young people with opportunities to acquire life skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, communication, creativity, and innovation. These are essential skills for educational, training and career readiness.   Recent policy developments, particularly at EU level, suggest that youth work opportunities have a special relevance and potential for those young people who are not in education, employments or training &ndash;the so called NEETS. <\/p><p>  My Department will be working closely with the Departments of Education, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to identify, in what ways, the youth sector can contribute to shared policy objectives to enhance support for this particularly vulnerable cohort of young people. <\/p><p>  In addition, the contribution of quality youth work to young people&rsquo;s development, well-being and social inclusion and its contribution to attaining the goals of Europe 2020, in particular the youth employment challenge are priority themes for the Irish Presidency of the Youth Council over the next 6 months.

Secondly, an application of the test and the McKenna principles to the material published by my Department.  The Court considered, and pronounced on, the inherent characteristics of the McKenna case and how a &#8216;clear disregard&#8217; of these would be identified.  It considered &#8216;clear disregard&#8217; to be an objective test and ruled that the High Court had erred in the test it had applied by way of a breach being blatant and egregious.  While in its application of the test, the Court noted that not everything in the advertisements, information booklet and website was objectionable under the McKenna principles, it ruled that the cumulative effect of matters identified in these materials, and set out in its judgement, amounts to a clear disregard of the McKenna principles.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The judgement in <i>McKenna<\/i> stated that the Government has a duty to give information to the electorate as well as to clarify issues which may arise in the course of the campaign, and must do so without advocating a particular position.

Community childcare services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  <\/p><p>  For the purpose of the CCS programme, eligibility is determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, low and middle income working parents may qualify for support.  Parents who qualify for the top rate of subvention under the programme receive a subsidy of &euro;95 per week towards full-day childcare costs.<\/p><p>  My Department is also responsible for implementing the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides subsidised childcare qualifying parents on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses.

House, election observation has been a key component of the work of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) since 1990, when the Office for Free Elections was established by the Paris Summit of the CSCE &#8211; the OSCE&#8217;s predecessor. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Office for Free Elections was renamed the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) in 1992 and ODIHR&#8217;s role in comprehensive election monitoring has been enhanced by OSCE participating States over time. The objectives of ODIHR's election observation activities are twofold:  (i) to assess electoral processes in accordance with OSCE election-related commitments;  and  (ii) to offer recommendations and assistance, where necessary, to bring electoral processes into line with those commitments.<\/p><p><br \/>  Since 1993, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA) has also observed elections in OSCE participating States, applying the particular expertise of parliamentarians to the task of election observation and enhancing the visibility of the OSCE&#8217;s election observation efforts. <\/p><p>A Cooperation Agreement on election activities was concluded between ODIHR and the OSCE PA in 1997, reflecting a desire to avoid overlap, redundancy, unnecessary expense and confusion between the two OSCE institutions. The 1997 Cooperation Agreement provides <i>inter alia<\/i>   for the exchange of information, participation by the Parliamentary Assembly in Needs Assessment Missions, common briefings and de-briefings and logistical support to Parliamentary Assembly short-term observers. <\/p><p>In 2006, at the Brussels OSCE Ministerial Council, participating States adopted Decision Number 19\/06, which <i>inter alia<\/i>   stressed that election observation is a common endeavour involving ODIHR, the OSCE PA and other parliamentary institutions, and called on ODIHR to continue to work in partnership with the OSCE PA on election observation missions on the basis of the 1997 Cooperation Agreement. <\/p><p><br \/>  Regrettably, despite the existence of the 1997 Cooperation Agreement, relations between ODIHR and the OSCE PA have not always been smooth. The Chairmanship-in-Office has only a very limited role in the field of election observation, essentially limited to the appointment of a Special Coordinator to lead short-term election observation missions. However, I can assure the Deputy that the Irish Chairmanship has sought at all times to apply the spirit and letter of the 1997 Cooperation Agreement, in the best interests of the Organisation as a whole.  <\/p><p><br \/>  In the specific case of the recent US elections, it is deeply regrettable that two separate and partially conflicting reports were released, one by the Limited Election Observation Mission deployed by ODIHR, and another by the short-term observer mission deployed by the OSCE PA.  Despite a written appeal by the Irish Chairmanship for both sides to coordinate - as they are committed to doing under the 1997 Cooperation Agreement - separate press conferences were also arranged in the days following the election. <\/p><p><br \/>  On 6 December last, during the opening session of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> OSCE Ministerial Council in Dublin, the President of the OSCE PA, Mr. Riccardo Migliori, outlined his organisation&#8217;s view that ODIHR was not adhering strictly to the 1997 Cooperation Agreement and announced that the OSCE PA regarded the Cooperation Agreement as &#8220;no longer valid and [&#8230;] no longer operative&#8221;.  As Chairman-in-Office<b>, <\/b>  I immediately expressed my regret that the OSCE PA was effectively terminating the Cooperation Agreement.  I recalled Ministerial Council decision 19\/06 and reaffirmed the Irish Chairmanship&#8217;s support for ODIHR&#8217;s election observation activities, based on the key principles of independence, impartiality and professionalism, as endorsed by participating States.<\/p><p><br \/>  ODIHR will continue to deploy election observation missions, as mandated by OSCE participating States, and it is my understanding that the OSCE PA will also continue its election observation programme independently from ODIHR.  I have been assured that ODIHR remains committed to conducting election observation as a common endeavour, in partnership with the OSCE PA and all other parliamentary institutions, in accordance with Ministerial Council decision 19\/06.   I hope that the OSCE PA will reconsider its position, in the best interests of the OSCE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":150,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC01950"},{"type":"question","counter":151,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[56639\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide an update regarding Ireland's commitment to overseas development aid in particular its commitment to the millennium development goals and the promise to increase overseas development aid to 0.7% of GNP in the context of Budget 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"966","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":152,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme prioritises the fight against global poverty and hunger.

These talks resulted in political agreement between the two governments to appoint a judge of international standing from outside both jurisdictions to undertake a thorough investigation of these cases and, in the event that a Public Inquiry was recommended in any case, to implement that recommendation.<\/p><p>  Following a thorough investigation of these allegations, Judge Peter Cory recommended a public inquiry into five of the six cases.  On foot of his recommendation, the Smithwick Tribunal was established by resolutions of D&aacute;il and Seanad Eireann in 2005 and is continuing its work. <\/p><p>  In his statement to parliament last Wednesday, Prime Minister Cameron acknowledged the systematic leaking by the security services to the UDA and paramilitary groups; failure by the RUC to act on threat intelligence; involvement by paid agents of the state in the murder of Pat Finucane; systematic failure to investigate and arrest West Belfast UDA agents involved in the murder; systematic attempts by police and army to disrupt and thwart investigations; and the deliberate misleading of Government ministers by officials.<\/p><p>  The picture revealed to parliament by the report, as Prime Minister Cameron has said, is truly shocking.  I respect the frankness and honesty with which the British Government has confronted the grievous failures identified in the report.  <\/p><p>  I believe that Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s apology in parliament to Mrs Finucane continues the process of healing that the Prime Minister set in train with his statement to Parliament on publication of the Saville Report into Bloody Sunday in June 2010.  <\/p><p>  It is a matter of public record however that the Irish government disagreed strongly with the decision by the British government last year to conduct a review rather than an inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane and, indeed, with the lack of consultation in advance of that decision. Our disagreement was born of a belief that public confidence is best served by a public inquiry where the process of getting to the truth is open to scrutiny and the findings placed beyond doubt.  In that, we were mindful of Judge Cory&rsquo;s concern that where doubts persist, myths and misconceptions might only proliferate.     <\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s view in favour of an inquiry is underpinned by an all-party motion of the D&aacute;il, agreed in 2006, which recalled the agreement under Weston Park; took note of Judge Cory&rsquo;s findings on collusion; commended the Finucane family for their courageous campaign and called for the immediate establishment of a full, independent, public judicial inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, as recommended by Judge Cory, which would enjoy the full co-operation of the family and the wider community throughout Ireland and abroad.<\/p><p>  I have conveyed the Government&rsquo;s long-established position on this matter to Deputy Prime Minister Clegg and to Secretary of State Villiers yesterday following publication of the de Silva report.<\/p><p>  The Government will continue to set out the case for an inquiry, mindful of the progress that has been made and mindful too of the responsibilities that both governments share in support of the peace process.  I believe the work undertaken by Desmond de Silva QC can facilitate this, helping ensure that an inquiry need not be lengthy, open-ended and inordinately expensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC03100","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation","counter":165,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC03150"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[56314\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of property tax that will need to be paid for a house valued at &euro;600,000 for a family on an invalidity pension of &euro;1,100 per month.","asker":"1017","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>The 2013 half year property tax amount due on a property valued at &#8364;600,000 is &#8364;517.

The brief was to design a tax on residences, and the Group was charged with the design of an equitable property tax to replace the household charge, a tax which was informed by previous work and international experience. <\/p><p>  The Group considered the site value tax (&lsquo;SVT&rsquo;) option and benchmarked it against a market value based system.  It reported that international experience would come down heavily in favour of using the market values of residential properties and that SVTs are not used extensively internationally. The vast majority of the submissions made to the Group also favoured market value as a basis for the tax.  Both residential market value and SVT meet a number of important policy criteria. The arguments for SVT are outweighed by the likely difficulties in ensuring acceptance by taxpayers, i.e., arriving at values that are evidence based, understandable and acceptable to the public in addition to complexities and uncertainties in the valuation effort necessary to put an SVT in place.<\/p><p>  Under a market value approach applied to housing, the market value of a residential property is related to the characteristics of the building itself, the site on which it is located and the characteristics and amenities of the neighbourhood.  There will be a relationship between the market value of a house and benefits to the owners in terms of enjoyment of the amenity value of the properties. The question &ndash; &ldquo;what is the value of my or our house or apartment?&rdquo; - is a relatively simple and well understood concept.<\/p><p>  The Group reported that, in the case of SVT, property owners would have great difficulty in dealing with a valuation exercise which conceptually separates the buildings on the site from the site (for tax purposes) in circumstances where their predominant understanding and interest lies in the market (or resale) value of their residence. Similar challenges would arise for auctioneers and valuers. The SVT system would not be as transparent or meaningful to taxpayers as market value.<\/p><p>  Both the 2009 and the 1982 &ndash; 1985 Commissions on Taxation recommended market value as a basis for the taxation of residential property.  The 2009 Commission on Taxation also considered both the site value and market value approaches.  They concluded that &ldquo;while seeing the economic rationale for land value tax...&rdquo; [that] &ldquo;it may not be a pragmatic approach to the restructuring of our property tax system&rdquo;.  The Commission recommended in favour of market value of residential properties (housing unit and site) as the basis of assessment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC03550"},{"type":"question","counter":172,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[56344\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800067#WRC03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the proposed fuel rebate scheme for road hauliers will apply to agricultural contractors;

Revenue is committed to prioritising resources to tackle the shadow economy and has developed specific strategies to guide the extensive work being undertaken in this area.  The approach adopted by Revenue towards intercepting contraband product, detecting illegal activity and prosecuting those involved is multi-faceted.  It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of illegal activity, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, engagement in multi-agency operations and optimum deployment of resources at the point of importation and inland.  <\/p><p><br \/>  For example, in response to fuel laundering, Revenue has recently strengthened the fuel-licensing regime to make it more difficult for launderers to get their product onto the market.  New and enhanced licensing requirements were introduced in 2012 for anyone dealing in marked fuels and auto fuels.  There will be a requirement, from 1 January 2013, for all fuel traders to make electronic monthly returns to Revenue on their fuel transactions, facilitating Revenue in detecting unusual or anomalous patterns of activity.  In addition to these important changes, Revenue is pursuing a more effective fuel marker in conjunction with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK, under a Memorandum of Understanding between the two authorities.  A joint invitation for submissions from companies and other interested parties, aimed at finding a replacement for the current fuel markers, generated international interest and a number of submissions were received by the closing date of 30th November 2012.  The joint evaluation of these submissions will take place over the coming months and will include rigorous technical testing to establish the resilience of the marker to existing and new laundering techniques. The evaluation is expected to be completed by mid 2013.     <\/p><p><br \/>  The work in tackling smuggling and trading in illicit products is ongoing and has led to significant detections and seizures of illicit product and to the prosecution and conviction of those involved.  With regard to illicit tobacco and fuel, since January 2011 <\/p><p>- Revenue has detected and closed 20 fuel-laundering plants, 11 of these in 2012;<\/p><p>- Since July of last year, over 70 fuel retail outlets have been closed: <\/p><p>- Over 2 million litres of fuel has been seized to date. <\/p><p><b>- 203<\/b> million cigarettes have been seized with a retail value of &#8364;<b>88.2m<\/b>, involving <b>18,237<\/b>   individual seizures.<\/p><p><b>- 16,572<\/b> kilos of tobacco have been seized with a retail value of <b>&#8364;6m<\/b>, involving <b>2,798<\/b>   seizures.<\/p><p>- Revenue obtained <b>159<\/b> convictions for cigarette smuggling, <b>56<\/b> of which resulted in custodial sentences and <b>&#8364;229,850<\/b>   in fines. <\/p><p>- Revenue achieved <b>131<\/b> convictions for sales of illicit cigarettes, <b>36<\/b> of which resulted in custodial sentences and fines of   <b>&#8364;263,900<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Counterfeit and pirated goods are a threat to legitimate businesses, and can pose significant health and safety risks.  The range of goods that is pirated is extensive and, as well as clothing, includes cosmetics, personal accessories, mobile phones and electronic equipment, CDs, DVDs, toys and medicines.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that under EU law, Customs action in relation to counterfeit goods is confined to goods being imported from or exported to countries outside the European Union, and that enforcement action in relation to intra-Community trade in such goods is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Revenue Commissioners inform me that there is close cooperation between them and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling the counterfeit trade, and that there is also ongoing international cooperation on the matter.  During 2011 and 2012, Revenue participated in five anti-counterfeit international operations organized under the auspices of the World Customs Organisation, and I understand that further operations of this kind are envisaged.<\/p><p><br \/>  The quantities of counterfeit goods that are seized by Revenue are significant.  In 2011, there were 4,166 seizures involving over 146,000 items (including more than 10,800 items of counterfeit clothing and personal accessories) with an estimated value of just over &#8364;9 million.  In the current year, to the end of September, there were 3,959 seizures comprising 76,801 items, including more than 43,400 items of clothing and accessories, with an estimated value of &#8364;3.74 million.<\/p><p><br \/>  Penalties for excise and counterfeit offences have increased substantially in recent years.  A person convicted is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of &#8364;5,000, or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both a fine and imprisonment.  Where a person is convicted for that offence on prosecution on indictment, the Court may impose a fine not exceeding &#8364;126,970, of where the value of the goods concerned is greater than &#8364;250,000, not exceeding three times their value.  The Court may impose a prison sentence not exceeding 5 years instead of, or in addition to, a fine. <\/p><p><br \/>  Finally, as regards resources, the Revenue Commissioners are subject to the Employment Control Framework staffing reductions in line with Government policy to reduce public service numbers.  In this context, I am satisfied that Revenue is affording priority to maintaining staffing numbers engaged in this area of work, to the greatest extent possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE00200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Transparency","counter":249,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE00250"},{"type":"question","counter":250,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[56488\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider modifying the various statements issued by the Revenue to persons so that these would state the total tax paid by a person as a percentage of their income as well as providing the various breakdowns under the different headings.","asker":"1034","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":251,"content":"<p>I am assuming that the Deputy's question is linked to the proposals contained in the Tax Transparency Bill which he introduced in the D&aacute;il on 29 March last.  In my contribution to the debate during the Second Stage on 9 November 2012 I referred to the costs and extensive administrative changes needed to advance the proposals contained in the Bill at the level of individual taxpayers.  The position is that the Revenue Commissioners do not issue any statements to the vast majority of taxpayers on the lines suggested and as part of their modernisation programme, are actively working to reduce the incidence of such statements.  For example, while taxpayers in the self assessment system, mainly consisting of the self-employed, are currently provided with an annual Notice of Assessment form by Revenue, it simply sets out what the taxpayer has filed in his\/her annual return of income.  Such taxpayers are in a better position than Revenue to calculate tax and other deductions as a percentage of income.  Furthermore, Finance Act 2012 introduced provisions, with effect from October 2014, removing the requirement for Revenue to issue an annual Notice of Assessment form to each taxpayer on receipt of their tax return.<\/p><p>  For taxpayers from whom tax is collected through the Pay As You Earn system, the Form P21 Balancing Statement, setting out the amount of taxable income and the amount of tax paid, is issued almost exclusively at the request of the taxpayer, often to provide evidence of income for other parts of the public sector.  Revenue is working with two public sector bodies to reduce the need to issue these statements by providing information directly, which has been outlined for the Deputy in the reply to a related Parliamentary Question today.  The Deputy will be aware that for PAYE taxpayers, the Form P60 they receive each year from their employer or pension provider contains all the required details &ndash; income tax, PRSI, USC and in future Local Property Tax &ndash; to enable them to carry out the percentage calculation if they so wished.<\/p><p>  To the extent that they are issued, which will decline, the statements referred to above are already very detailed documents containing significant amounts of complex information.  Revenue is constantly looking at ways to make the statements shorter and easier for the taxpayer to understand.  Including the type of information sought by the Deputy on these statements would involve a major re-draft of the documents concerned and would cost a significant amount of money to develop.  I am not satisfied that the benefits to be derived from implementing the Deputy's proposals would outweigh the costs involved and I would have concerns that the documents would become so congested that they would be less informative for the taxpayer and would lose their impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE00450"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[56490\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review a case regarding the assessment of the value of certain properties for the local property tax (details supplied)","asker":"1034","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>Revenue will provide guidance on how to value property early next year, and will engage in a comprehensive information campaign, including writing to residential property owners in March 2013 enclosing a detailed explanatory booklet on the operation of the Local Property Tax (LPT), valuation procedures and payments methods, as well as an LPT Return form for completion.

The reason for making a personal representative a liable person is to prevent the avoidance of the payment of local property tax by means of unnecessarily delaying the distribution of the estate and the transfer of a property to the person who would become the liable person in respect of the property.  This might happen, for example, where the person who inherits the property is already living in the property and there are no other beneficiaries involved.  The tax will be part of the expenses of the estate, along with other regular expenses, including other taxes, where applicable.  <\/p><p>  A system of voluntary deferral arrangements is in place in relation to Local Property Tax.  These are focused on particular categories of householders and will be implemented to address cases where there is a real and substantial inability to pay the LPT.  They will be granted under specific conditions, as follows: <\/p><p>- Where the gross income does not exceed &euro;15,000 (single) and &euro;25,000 (couple). <\/p><p>- For income stressed owner-occupiers who have an outstanding mortgage, an adjusted gross income limit will apply &ndash; where gross income less 80% of mortgage interest falls below &euro;15,000\/&euro;25,000 a deferral option will be available up to the end of 2017 (when mortgage interest relief also ends). <\/p><p>  In addition, <\/p><p>- Marginal relief will apply for owner-occupiers where the income or adjusted income is &euro;10,000 above the income limit (&euro;15,000\/&euro;25,000) to permit deferrals of up to 50% of LPT liability. <\/p><p>- Interest will be charged on deferred amounts but at a lower rate (i.e. 4% per annum) than the rate charged in default cases (i.e. 8% per annum).  The deferred amount, including interest, will be a charge on the property.  Deferred property taxes and interest will have to be discharged on the sale\/transfer of the property. <\/p><p>Where a surviving spouse, civil partner or cohabitant remains within the income thresholds for a couple, a deferral will be allowed to continue as long as the income requirement is met. <\/p><p>  Under section 134 of the Bill, where the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, as the case may be, of a liable person dies, the liable person may continue to claim a deferral until the first liability date of the next valuation period notwithstanding that he or she does not meet the income limits specified above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":270,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE01750"},{"type":"question","counter":271,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[56612\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total cost to the Exchequer in a full year of new tax reliefs introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013, directed at the agricultural sector, the break down of the saving per relief; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":272,"content":"<p>The tax changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 which have particular relevance to the agricultural sector are set out below<b><i>.<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><b><i>Budget 2012<\/i><\/b><\/p><p><i>Extension of the existing VAT Refund Order for flat-rate farmers to include a refund on the purchase of wind turbines<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  Budget 2012 provided for an extension to the VAT refund order for unregistered farmers to wind turbines and other micro-energy generators purchased from 1 January 2012.

The scheme is reviewed annually by reference to macro-economic data, for the preceding three years, on agricultural production and agricultural inputs and the deductible VAT content of such inputs.  The reduction in the flat-rate addition to 4.8% for 2013 is a result of calculations on the basis of macro economic data received from the Central Statistics Office for 2010, 2011 and 2012.

The levy will operate for a period of 4 years only (2011 to 2014) and the legislative provisions giving effect to the levy (section 4 of Finance (No 2) Act 2011) were specifically drafted to reflect this.  I confirmed in my Budget 2013 Speech that the levy will not be renewed after 2014.<\/p><p><br \/>  The moneys raised from the pension fund levy are being used to pay for the Government's <i>Jobs Initiative <\/i>introduced<i><\/i>in May 2011.  The measures introduced as part of the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i>   include a new 9% VAT rate on certain activities, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.  The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of the Government.  The measures announced in the <i>Jobs Initiative<\/i> are aimed at assisting in employment generation &#8211; providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers. <\/p><p><br \/>  The chargeable persons for the levy are the trustees or other persons (including insurance companies) with responsibility for the management of the assets of the pension schemes or plans.  The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled, where they decide to do so, to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy.  It is up to the trustees to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible.  I cannot intervene in this process in respect of the pension fund referred to in the details supplied with the question or other pension funds.  However, the legislation also includes safeguards aimed at ensuring that benefits payable, either currently or prospectively to any member, are adjusted in such a way that the reduction in value of those benefits shall not exceed 0.6% of the market value of the assets accounting for the scheme's liabilities to that member. <\/p><p><br \/>  I am conscious of the concerns of pension scheme members about the impact of a levy in circumstances where the pensions sector, in common with other sectors in our economy and society, is finding the current economic and financial environment very challenging.  However, much of the value of pension funds is attributable to the rolled up value of generous tax reliefs that pension savings have historically been granted and continue to receive.  The imposition of the levy is for a relatively short period and its purpose is to improve the economic environment by providing the means to encourage job creation in areas of our economy most likely to deliver that employment quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE03550"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[56818\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800069#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding capital gains liability in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; the reasons, if any, the exemption is not applied to them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that relief from capital gains tax was available where a farmer sold land and used the proceeds to purchase other land for use in farming.

NAMA was, as the Deputy is aware, established to (1) remove systemic risk to the Irish banking system through the acquisition of land and development and associated loans from participating institutions and (2) to obtain the best achievable return to the State from these acquired loans.  NAMA has completed the first of these major undertakings through the valuation, purchase and transfer of relevant loans from the participating institutions.  In the process, NAMA has injected over 30 billion in liquidity into the Irish banking system.  Alongside this, the establishment and development of the Agency itself to carry out the tasks mandated to it by the NAMA Act 2009 has been another important achievement.<\/p><p>  NAMA is now fully engaged in its core role of managing and selling the assets under its control with a view to obtaining the best financial return for the state.  The progress that is being made is exemplified by the fact that, since inception, NAMA has generated total cash flows of over &euro;10 billion, circa &euro;6.6 billion in asset sales, with a further &euro;2 billion in the pipeline, and circa &euro;3.5 billion in non-disposal income, mainly rental receipts from properties controlled by its debtors and receivers.<\/p><p>  As a result of its current cash and liquid asset balance and strong cash-generation capacity, NAMA is firmly on course to meet its ultimate objective of redeeming over its projected ten-year life to 2020, at minimum, the Senior Bonds issued as consideration for the acquired bank assets in addition to recovery of its carrying costs and the working and development capital expenditure advanced in the course of its work.  I am advised by NAMA that it has already redeemed &euro;3.25 billion of its debt and is in no doubt as to its ability to meet its end-2013 target of redeeming &euro;7.5 billion in Senior Bonds.

From an overall public policy perspective, a number of steps have been taken to protect all homeowners experiencing mortgage difficulty.  The Central Bank&#8217;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears is a key protection and provides that each bank must put in place a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process to deal with its mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears and for the establishment of dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes to handle such cases.  The Code highlights the importance of a borrower contacting their lender when they are in arrears or pre-arrears.  The Central Bank has published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears called &#8216;Mortgage Arrears &#8211; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender&#8217; and this is available on the Central Bank website:  <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>   .<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217; and a number of significant milestones have now been achieved:<\/p><p> - The Personal Insolvency Bill, which was published last June by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, has now concluded in the Seanad and is returning to the D&aacute;il this week;<\/p><p> - The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &#8220;mortgage to rent&#8221; scheme on a nationwide basis;<\/p><p> - Lenders have provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed forbearance and loan modification options which will be made available, in appropriate cases, to their customers who are in mortgage difficulty.  The roll out of these options has commenced with Central Bank oversight;<\/p><p> - An extensive independent mortgage advice framework has been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">www.keepingyourhome.ie<\/font><\/i>   (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline and (iii) the provision of free independent &#8216;one-to-one&#8217; professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance\/resolution offer from their lender.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government, therefore, is proceeding along the lines of the general recommendations set out in the &#8216;Keane Report&#8217; which indicated that the primary focus should be on those mortgage holders who are experiencing significant repayment difficulty or who are in an unsustainable situation.  The Report did not consider a blanket debt write off approach, either to write down the amount of negative equity that may exist in residential mortgages or otherwise, to be an appropriate response to the mortgage problem.  It was indicated that such an approach would be a very inefficient way to tackle the real problem and would impose significant further losses which could not be afforded by taxpayers or society at large.  While unfortunately the latest Central Bank statistics indicate that the number of mortgages in arrears continues to rise, it must nevertheless also be noted that the significant majority of mortgage holders continue to meet their mortgage commitments.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ultimately the Government is of the view that it is the regeneration of the economy, the restoration of employment levels and income growth that will address the real social and economic problems associated with high levels of mortgage and personal indebtedness.  That is why Government is focussed through its many new initiatives at fostering and generating economic growth.  The successful achievement of this objective will restore consumer confidence and bring the tangible and sustainable recovery that the country requires.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800070#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":361,"content":"<p>Question No. 194 answered with Question No. 159.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":362,"content":"<p>Questions No. 195 and 196 answered with Question No. 128.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800071#WRG00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800071#WRG00350"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[56336\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800071#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the allocation of funding to a school(details supplied) in County Kerry to provide an autism unit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>I pleased to inform the Deputy that devolved funding for the provision of a 2-classroom ASD Unit was approved in October 2012 under my Department's Additional Accommodation Scheme for the school referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800071#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":366,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800071#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[56345\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800071#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if any concerns have been conveyed to him in relation to non-payment, underpayment or late payment for work done on projects funded by his Department since his appointment in March 2011.","asker":"1090","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>My Department although it is the primary funding agency, is generally not the contracting authority on building projects in the Education Sector.

The Government has decided to raise the pupil-teacher ratio for PLC courses to the same level as that which applies in all free second level schools &ndash; 19:1, from next September.<\/p><p>This decision is being made at a time when the Government has succeeded in protecting class sizes in primary and free second-level schools for the coming year, ensuring that our limited resources are rightly focussed on the children in our education system.<\/p><p>While it would be preferable not to have to make any changes, it is hard to justify providing more generous pupil-teacher ratios to PLCs which educates adults, than second-level schools which cater for teenagers.<\/p><p>This change will reduce the number of teaching posts by 200 in PLC and may lead to some reduction in subject choices for students. The further education sector has expanded rapidly over the past few decades, developing many innovative programmes for its students. It is now up to the CEOs of each VEC to look at the resources available to them and to work with their Principals and staff to ensure they can continue to deliver programmes which closely meet the needs of both students and employers.<\/p><p>PLC providers have been enrolling significantly above their allocation of places in recent years, and I do not expect that this measure will impact on the number of PLC places available.<\/p><p>In 2012, my Department is providing some &euro;160 million in funding for the PLC programme, covering staff costs and non-pay costs, as well as student support.  There are 32,688 approved PLC places available nationwide.  Places are allocated to VECs, Community and Comprehensive and Voluntary Secondary schools on an annual basis following an application process and VECs are responsible for the further allocation of those places to schools and colleges under their remit.<\/p><p>Employment of teachers for the PLC programme is a matter for individual VECs or Community and Comprehensive and Voluntary Secondary schools. My Department does not hold details of teacher's contracts therefore no information is available on the number of full time permanent or part time fixed term teachers in PLC.<\/p><p>These changes will not take effect until September 2013. In the meantime VECs will have an opportunity to plan for the reduced allocation across the schools\/colleges under their remit. This necessary change will result in an estimated saving of &euro;12 million in a full year.  As the change will be introduced at the start of the academic year in September 2013 the savings from Sept to Dec 2013 will be &euro;4million.  It is not possible to amend this measure without introducing additional Budget measures in education which would impact on other frontline services.<\/p><p>The table details the reduction in teacher allocation per VEC. The remaining 11 teaching posts will be across a number of schools in the Voluntary Secondary and Community and Comprehensive sector who also deliver the PLC programme.<\/p><p><table><tr><th><div>VEC<\/div><\/th><th><div>Reduction in Teacher Allocation <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Co.

Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  Employees must have at least two years&rsquo; service to be eligible for a redundancy payment.  Claims for statutory redundancy can be taken to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.<\/p><p>  It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all its eligible employees. I understand from the Department of Social Protection that where an employer makes a statutory redundancy payment to an eligible employee made redundant before 1 January 2013, he\/she is entitled to a rebate of a portion of that payment from the State.  As a result of changes announced as part of Budget 2013, the employer rebate is being abolished for cases where the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy is on or after 1st January 2013.  The 15% rebate will continue to be payable in respect of redundancies which occurred on or after 1st January 2012 up to 31st December 2012.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund.<\/p><p>  As regards an employer&rsquo;s inability to afford to pay redundancy to his\/her employees, where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department of Social Protection that he\/she is unable to pay the statutory redundancy to his\/her employees the Department of Social Protection will make lump sum payments directly to the employees and will seek to recover the debt from the employer.  The recent Budget announcement has no impact on this position.  To prove inability to pay the employer must submit documentary evidence to confirm that this is the position.  This evidence usually takes the form of a recent statement of affairs and a letter from the company&rsquo;s accountant\/solicitor to confirm that this is the position.<\/p><p>  I understand from the Department of Social Protection that an employer may lay-off staff when he\/she is unable to provide work, but she\/he believes this to be a temporary situation and gives the employee notification of the lay-off before the work finishes. A lay-off can only occur if it is provided for in the employee&rsquo;s contract of employment, if it is custom and practice in the workplace or if the employee agrees to the lay-off.  However, if an employee has been laid-off for 4 weeks or more, or for 6 of the previous 13 weeks, he\/she may give the employer a notice in writing of his\/her intention to claim redundancy under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007.  Accordingly, an employer cannot compulsorily lay-off an employee for an indefinite period.<\/p><p>  There is case law in relation to lay-off being used inappropriately, forcing employees to waive their rights to notice and request redundancy.  For example, the Industrial Yarns -v- Green case [1984] ILRM 15 and the Irish Leathers -v- Minister for Labour case [1986] IR 177 both concerned lay-off being mis-used by employers in order to deny employees their entitlement to pay in lieu of notice which concerned.<\/p><p>  Employment rights legislation also contains a variety of protections in the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 &ndash; 2005 to protect the interests of employees who have been dismissed or made redundant or are facing dismissal or redundancy.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the Unfair Dismissals Acts is to protect employees from being unfairly dismissed from their jobs by laying down criteria by which dismissals are judged to be unfair, by providing a system for adjudication of complaints of unfair dismissal and, where an employee has been found to have been unfairly dismissed, redress.  The Acts apply to a person who has been in the continuous service of the employer for more than one year.  In certain circumstances (e.g. dismissal because of pregnancy or trade union membership), the one year requirement does not apply.  Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, an employer must demonstrate that there were substantial grounds justifying a dismissal.<\/p><p>  In general, redundancy is a situation where an employee's job no longer exists and no replacement is necessary.  Where an employee has at least one year&rsquo;s service, the employee may take an Unfair Dismissals case to a Rights Commissioner if the employee was made redundant in circumstances where he\/she considers that a redundancy situation did not exist.

In addition, in the case of employees who are employed on a series of short-term (fixed-term) contracts with less than a three-month gap between the contracts, the length of the contracts may be added together for the purposes of calculation of continuity of service under the Unfair Dismissals Acts if, in the opinion of the employment rights adjudication bodies, the entry by the employer into the subsequent contracts was wholly or partly for, or was connected with, the purpose of the avoidance of liability under the Unfair Dismissals Acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800076#WRM04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Initiatives","counter":643,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800076#WRM04150"},{"type":"question","counter":644,"qnumday":297,"qnumall":"[56798\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800076#WRM04200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if he will set up a jobs task force, similar to that in the south east of the country to fill the employment vacuum in counties Longford and Westmeath (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1062","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":645,"content":"<p>The initiative which was established last year for the South East region followed a very significant and unexpected company closure, involving a major loss of jobs in one company in Waterford City.

In addition, several infrastructural deficits have been identified in that region and business start-ups are small and focussed on the domestic market.

The <b>Intra-Company Transfer Employment Permit Scheme <\/b>in particular, facilitates the transfer of senior management, key personnel or trainees who are foreign nationals from an overseas branch of a multinational corporation to its Irish branch.  Only 5% of the workforce may have Intra-company Transfer Permits, however, for start-ups this may be waived on a case by case basis for an initial period.  No labour market needs test is required prior to making an application for an Intra-Company Transfer permit.<\/p><p>The <b>Green Card Employment Permit Scheme<\/b> is used by Ireland to meet labour market requirements where skills shortages have been identified by reference to analyses undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.  It is designed to attract highly skilled and highly paid individuals into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State.  The employee may apply for immediate family re-unification and an application for long-term residence may be made after two years. No labour market needs test (e.g. newspaper and F&Aacute;S\/EURES advertising) is required prior to making an application.

There are significant structural and affordability problems with defined benefit (DB) pension schemes due to a range of factors such as an under-estimation of longevity, poor investment decisions and the impact of the downturn in financial markets. The investment losses in Ireland were the highest in the OECD because of the high proportion of equities in pension fund portfolios, with some two-thirds of assets in equities compared with an average of just over one third in the 20 OECD countries where data are available.<\/p><p>  A review of the DB model which included consultation with stakeholders was completed in 2011.  The consultation resulted in a broad consensus that DB schemes as currently organised are vulnerable to shocks and the introduction of a risk reserve would provide a level of protection for scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.  I accept that the requirement for a risk reserve presents an added challenge for schemes, however, guidance issued by the Pensions Board identifies options which schemes can consider in meeting this requirement by 2023.<\/p><p>  The level of the risk reserve required will reflect the level of risk undertaken by the scheme&rsquo;s investment strategy and it is estimated that this reserve will add approximately 8% to the scheme liabilities. A risk reserve of 15% would indicate that the scheme is over reliant on equity investment. It should also be noted that the requirement to hold a risk reserve is not being introduced immediately.  Schemes are aware that the requirement to hold a reserve is a being introduced in 2016 and schemes will have until 2023 to satisfy this requirement.  The pension promise associated with DB schemes is generally regarded as unconditional.  If the scheme winds-up, the only practical way the promise can be fulfilled is to buy an annuity policy from an assurance company that guarantees a continued pension for the lifetime of the pensioner and their dependants. If the funding standard is changed in such a way that understates the cost of the benefits then the member will be misled about the ability of the scheme to meet its obligations.<\/p><p>  I understand that a small number of European countries have eased their pension solvency requirements in response to the downturn in financial markets. I am satisfied that in all cases, the solvency regime after those changes continues to be more onerous that the current Irish regime.  Overall the changes made to DB schemes are intended to reduce schemes&rsquo; exposure to risks and provide greater security for scheme members.  Issues in relation to the pensions levy is a matter for the Minister for Finance who announced the pension fund levy as part of the Jobs Initiative.  The levy will apply for a period of 4 years from 2011 to 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800080#WRQ01800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":370,"qnumall":"[56759\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800080#WRQ01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 116 of 30 June 2011, if, in respect of Government plans to increase the retirement age to 66 in 2014, there is a provision for those who are presently contractually obliged to retire at age 65 and will retire in 2014 and will therefore not be entitled to receive their contributory pensions until one year after they finish work , in particular in view of the fact that jobseeker's allowance will now only support them for nine months of that year.","asker":"1034","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":817,"content":"<p><b><\/b>  Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The population share of those aged 65 and over is expected to more than double between now and 2051, from 11% to approximately 23% in 2050. In contrast, the working age to pensioner ratio is projected to decline gradually from 5.3 \/1 to 2.1\/1.  This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  The fundamental principle involved here is that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) thereby standardizing State pension age for all at 66 years. The State pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.  Even with these changes to State pensions expenditure is projected to increase from approximately 5.8% of GDP in 2010, to almost 8.3%% in 2060.  The standardisation of State pension age at 66 removes the retirement condition associated with State pension (transition) which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce and has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment. There is no retirement condition attached to the State pension (contributory) which is currently payable from age 66.<\/p><p><br \/>  From 2014, any individual aged 65 and unable to remain in, or find, employment would be entitled to apply for a social welfare payment based on the normal criteria.  At present, my Department is working with the relevant agencies of State who have a role to play in identifying and breaking down barriers to remaining in work past the age of 65.

A person entering BTEA with an entitlement to the maximum jobseekers personal rate of &euro;188 per week may retain this rate while pursuing a course. A significant majority of those entering BTEA do so on the maximum personal rate of payment.  In addition, all Jobseekers who engage with BTEA are exempt from the underlying conditions of that payment in relation to being genuinely available and seeking work for the duration of their course, which allows them to concentrate fully on their studies. BTEA participants may also take up part time employment while engaged with BTEA without affecting their BTEA rate of payment. Participants who cannot find employment for summer months between academic years are also allowed to sign on the Live Register and receive a jobseekers payment for this period where an entitlement exists.<\/p><p>  While the cost of education allowance will not be payable to new and existing BTEA participants from January 1st   2013, other Budget changes introduced from this date apply to new entrants only and do not affect those already furthering their education through BTEA. New entrants aged under 25 years old continue to be incentivised to further their education through BTEA. From January 1st   2013 under 25&rsquo;s on age reduced jobseekers payments will have their weekly payments increased to &euro;160 per week if they engage with BTEA. This represents a &euro;60 per week increase for 18-21 year olds whose maximum weekly jobseekers payment is &euro;100 and a &euro;16 per week increase for 22-24 year olds who have an entitlement to a maximum weekly jobseekers payment of &euro;144. Only in cases where means exist will the weekly rate fall below &euro;160 and means will now be assessed against the new maximum rate of &euro;160, ensuring even those with means will receive an incentive for participating in education through BTEA.<\/p><p>  From January 1st   new entrants aged over 25 years old entering BTEA on a reduced payment due to means will continue to receive this entitlement. This entitlement is based on a means test carried out by my Department and is the rate deemed appropriate to an individual based on their unique circumstances. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800080#WRQ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":821,"content":"<p>Question No. 372 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800080#WRQ02350"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":373,"qnumall":"[56794\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800080#WRQ02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will issue on an application for a carer's allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Leitrim; the reason for the delay; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":824,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question on the 20th December 2011.

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage, including thatched buildings, by including them on the Record of Protected Structures. Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. While the overall number of thatch roofs declined in the second half of the 20th century, legislative protection and heightened awareness of this part of our national heritage has ensured that this decline has stabilised. <\/p><p>  There are a number of State financial supports currently available to owners\/occupiers of thatched structures. In 2012, my Department provided &euro;500,000 in grant-aid assistance through a Structures at Risk Fund administered by local authorities to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012, including the conservation of two thatched structures. It is hoped that the Structures at Risk Fund will be continued in 2013.<\/p><p>  The Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, administers a grants scheme to REPS 4 participants on the conservation and repair of traditional farm buildings, known as the Traditional Farm Buildings Grant Scheme. Grants are available under this scheme to carry out approved conservation works to the exterior of farm outbuildings including roofs. I understand that, subject to continued availability of funding, a call for applications for the 2013\/14 scheme will be issued next year.<\/p><p>  I further understand that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government administers a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of owner occupied houses. <\/p><p>  The level of funding available in 2013 and future years for these schemes will be subject to the normal Budgetary and Estimates processes. As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for additional funding for the conservation of the built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances. <\/p><p>  In relation to policy and guidance matters, my Department, with the assistance of an Expert Advisory Committee representing key stakeholders, is currently finalising a review of the operation of Part IV of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012. The review will consider the need, in the light of current economic circumstances, to develop alternative ways of supporting the conservation of protected structures, including thatched structures. <\/p><p>In addition, as part of an Architectural Advice Series, my Department plans to publish an advice book on thatching in 2013, which will include further practical advice and guidance on aspects of conserving and restoring thatched structures. The nine previously published booklets in the Architectural Advice Series cover areas such as roof and energy efficiency for traditionally built buildings. The full series is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.ahg.gov.ie  .<\/p><p>  The issue of insurance for historic buildings, including thatched structures, has been raised by my Department with both the Financial Services Regulator and the Irish Insurance Federation.

I have no direct statutory function in relation to the connection of towns to the gas network.<\/p><p>  The CER, in 2006, approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  This policy ensures that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  Otherwise uneconomic projects will increase costs for all energy consumers.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.<\/p><p>  Having regard to CER&rsquo;s new network connections policy, Bord G&aacute;is Networks, and more recently Gaslink, carried out a comprehensive assessment of 39 towns (including Nenagh) not already connected to the national gas network, with detailed economic analysis based on criteria outlined in the policy.  The study was published in April 2010 following approval by the CER.  The Gaslink report found that 35 towns, including Nenagh, did not qualify for connection on economic grounds.<\/p><p>  Nevertheless, Gaslink continues to review the towns which did not qualify for connection under the study, and other towns, on an ongoing basis.  I understand that Gaslink is currently reviewing the case for the connection of Nenagh to the national gas network and has very recently made a revised submission to the CER to assess the feasibility of the connection of the town.  Following assessment by the CER, a decision will be made by the Regulator.  Engineering works on the project can only commence on receipt of the relevant approval from the CER and any approval will be subject to Gaslink securing sufficient gas loads in the area.  No trial holes have been carried out to date along the proposed pipeline route.

O'Sullivan)    In line with overall national policy which promotes a reduction in energy use, the enhancement of energy efficiency standards remains a priority within my Department&rsquo;s overall strategy for the improvement of local authority housing. Under the Department&rsquo;s Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock. The programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building and the installation of high-efficiency condensing boilers. <\/p><p>  Some &euro;18 million was allocated to local authorities for this purpose in 2012. My Department provides a grant of up to &euro;15,000 per dwelling, depending on the energy improvement achieved, for necessary works such as attic and wall insulation, the replacement of windows and external doors and the fitting of energy-efficient condensing boilers. Additional funding, to a maximum of &euro;3,000, is available for other essential improvement works to the dwelling. Under this year&rsquo;s improvement works programme, the focus remains on returning vacant properties to productive use. Given the constraints on new local authority housing supply, it is important that the existing stock of local authority housing is available and in fit condition to meet housing need.   <\/p><p>  While the objective is to improve the general standard of a local authority house and increase the Building Energy Rating (BER) to as high a level as possible, with C1 being the target figure, it may not be practicable to bring every dwelling to this standard, especially in the case of older stock.  I intend to review the retrofitting measure, in the context of the work programme for 2013, with a view to possible changes to improve the effectiveness of the measure.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800084#WRU00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Development","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800084#WRU00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1026,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[56931\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800084#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans for the future of the Dodder Valley Partnership and CPLN area partnership including assurances regarding future funding, confirmation that there will be no reductions in services and proposals for the headquarters of the new partnership company; if he appreciates the need to assure the community in this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":1027,"content":"<p>Following Government approval, I published the action programme for effective local government, Putting People First, which, inter alia, addresses the alignment of local and community development with local government.

The new structure will operate within the SDCC boundary and will facilitate the generation of efficiencies; in the longer term it will allow a more effective sharing of resources, reducing overall administration and operating costs, while at the same time preserving the core, front-line element of the LCDP. <\/p><p>  Following consultations between my Department, the Chairpersons, CEOs and Boards of Management of both companies and SDCC, an agreement was reached. This involves the establishment of a single Company to promote and deliver Local and Community Development Programmes in the South County Dublin Area. In advancing this work and the broader alignment initiative, I am concerned that the integrity of the local development model is appropriately protected as outlined in the Alignment Report.   <\/p><p>  Guidelines for the governance of all Local Development Companies were drawn up in 2007 and these include a structure for the Board of each Company.

Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalties for such an offence, on summary conviction, include a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.

These include random, targeted and intelligence led searches.  These searches have been particularly effective and local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.  As the Deputy can see the number of mobile phones seized in prisons has reduced, year on year, from 2009 and given the figure for the year to date it is expected that the final figure for 2012 will show a further decrease  .

It is important to remember that while some Garda stations are listed for revised opening hours from 24 hour stations, they will remain as functioning Garda stations on a 24 hour basis. The full list of these details is available in the Policing Plan which is available in the Oireachtas Library. <\/p><p>  The Commissioner has concluded that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front-line if particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained or if the public opening hours of other stations could be reduced at off-peak times. In making that decision he has reiterated the commitment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to providing a professional and effective service to the community. Each Divisional Officer with responsibility for a Division that will be affected by this decision was asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area and has been tasked with developing a comprehensive consultation strategy together with a tailored implementation plan that will meet the particular needs of their Division. <\/p><p>  We also need to be honest about the level of policing service that was capable of being provided from the stations that were and are to be closed.  Of the 100 stations to be closed next year, 98% are only open part-time, 94% are open for 3 hours a day or less, 88% are served by 1 Garda and only 5% are served by 3 or more Garda personnel.  In fact, of the 39 stations closed this year, 8 were not actually open at all.  Their closure was a paper exercise which simply recognised reality.  <\/p><p>  The intention will be that at all times optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. The revised structures will continue to support the community policing philosophy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of an enhanced grid patrolling system that will be operational and intelligence led.\u00a0 This patrol system will ensure that a high visibility and community oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800085#WRV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":1110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800086#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1111,"qnumday":477,"qnumall":"[56453\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800086#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps he has taken to address the issues proposed by this Deputy in the Private Members Bill Precious Metal Dealers Bill 2011, which was an effort to regulate the cash for gold and cash for scrap industries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1112,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that on 19 June 2012 I published a report on the criminal justice aspects of the cash for gold trade which was prepared by my Department.

The purpose of the discussion document is to facilitate a public consultation process.  On its publication, I referred the discussion document to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The joint committee is conducting the consultation process and will report back to me when it has completed its work.  In addition, my Department hosted a conference on 13 October to discuss the consultation paper.  The report of the joint committee and the views expressed at the October conference will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary legislative proposals to be submitted to the Government in due course.  For further background, I am appending the text of my statement of 22 June last when publishing the discussion document:<blockquote>Shatter Announces Publication of Discussion Document on the Future Direction of Legislation on Prostitution<br \/><br \/>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence today published a discussion document on the future direction of legislation on prostitution.  Publication of the discussion document follows the Minister&#8217;s announcement that he would be arranging a public consultation process as part of the current review of prostitution legislation.  Announcing publication of the discussion document, Minister Shatter said:<br \/><br \/>&quot;The criminal law in this area is being reviewed primarily because of the changed nature of prostitution in Ireland.  Prostitution was once mainly a street-based phenomenon.  That is no longer the case.  The organisation of prostitution is now much more sophisticated, highly mobile and is easily facilitated by the use of mobile phones and the internet.  There is, of course, already a clear consensus on the great evils of child prostitution and trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  However, I am aware that there are differing and genuinely held views on the approach the criminal law should take to other aspects of prostitution.  While there is a significant amount of criminal legislation in this area already, there is always scope for change and improvement.  It is important to review the law periodically to ensure it is up to date and comprehensively responds to altered circumstances.&quot;<br \/><br \/>The Minister added that: &quot;Prostitution is an issue which affects individuals, communities and society as a whole.  It is important that I facilitate the expression of all views on this subject and that those views are examined in due course.  Public debate should therefore, be open to the widest possible audience and I want to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so.  It is for that reason I have decided on a consultation process before charting the way forward.  My Department will hold a conference in the autumn to discuss the document.  The widest possible participation will be encouraged in order that we have an open and transparent discussion on all aspects of this very important issue.  This discussion document will now be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. Interested groups and members of the public, I expect, will be invited to make submissions to the Committee which will hold such hearings as it deems appropriate. I am asking Mr. David Stanton T.D., Chairman of the Joint Committee, that it publish its report and recommendations by the 30th November 2012 and that the report be furnished to me together with any submissions received. I expect it is likely that the Committee&#8217;s report will also be lodged in the Oireachtas Library and that a debate on it will subsequently take place in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. The report received by me from the Joint Oireachtas Committee will be fully considered in the framing of any necessary new legislative proposals to be submitted to Government in due course.  I look forward to the results of the consultation process.&quot;<br \/><br \/>The discussion document is attached below and will be made available on the Department&#8217;s website, .

My Department has since then been preparing the Heads of a new Bill.  I hope to be able to bring the Heads to Government in the near future for its approval and agreement to proceed to formal drafting.  The new legislation will provide a comprehensive new regulatory system for gambling, replacing the separate systems still in place for betting and gaming under the Betting Act 1931 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, as amended.  It will, therefore, be a unified system and it will set out the new licensing, inspection and enforcement systems.  The systems will apply to the land-based outlets that most people are familiar with, but they will also apply to on-line services and to services provided any other form of electronic technology.  I have ensured that the new systems have been designed with the protection of consumers as their main purpose, particularly vulnerable persons, including, of course, young persons.  I plan to make the Heads available on my Department's website once they have been approved by the Government.

In addition to this direct financial support,   I have secured agreement for a range of taxation reliefs that would link in with the key measures being pursued in Harvest 2020 for the growth and development of the agriculture, food and marine sectors.<\/p><p>  These measures reflect the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the agri-food industry and the expansion planned in the Food Harvest 2020 Strategy. I am also providing strong financial support for some &euro;19m, for research across animal and crop production sustainability and food processing, traceability, safety and quality, consistent with the Think Green Act Smart, Achieve Growth principles of Food Harvest 2020. This research will play a key role in driving innovation within the bio-economy and contribute strongly to the growth targets in Food Harvest 2020. This provision builds on my recent announcement of &euro;32m of grant Aid for 55 research projects focussing on sustainable food production, processing and forestry.<\/p><p>  The 2013 budget reflects a significant Exchequer commitment of support for the agri-food sector and is recognition of the contribution which the sector can make to economic recovery and future growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800087#WRX03900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":1200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800087#WRX03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1201,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[56256\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800087#WRX04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the sectors of the agri food sector in respect of which he foresees growth or substantial growth over the next four years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1202,"content":"<p>The Food Harvest 2020 report set a growth value target of 33% to be achieved by 2020 for the primary sector and within that overall target the dairy and seafood sectors are areas where the most substantial growth is envisaged over the next four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800087#WRX04100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Imports","counter":1204,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1205,"qnumday":509,"qnumall":"[56257\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of traceability inspections carried out by his Department in respect of pig meat, beef, lamb and poultry imports in each of the past eight years to date; the number of breaches of the regulations detected and the actions taken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1206,"content":"<p>It is not possible to provide this information in the required time.

Dairy farmers&#8217; incomes are comprised of the returns they receive for their milk from processors and their EU support payments.  As some 85% of Irish dairy production is exported, mostly to other EU countries, the price of milk in Ireland is ultimately determined by supply and demand on world and EU markets.  Since the 2006 reduction in CAP market supports to a safety net level the milk price in the EU has become more volatile and this price fluctuation can be expected to continue.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, growth in global population and wealth is forecast to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products.  Against that background, I believe that prospects and opportunities for the dairy sector will expand significantly over the coming years.  From 2015, Ireland will be free to produce milk to take advantage of the increasing demand for dairy products and through the <i>Food Harvest 2020<\/i>   report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020.  The best way to deal with market instability is to develop a competitive dairy sector that can deal with the challenges and benefit from the opportunities that a global market provides.  <\/p><p><br \/>  A key element of this market strategy is to optimise the already positive green image of Ireland in order to create a point of differentiation for Irish dairy products on international markets. In this context, stakeholders are at present engaged, through Bord Bia, in technical discussions to establish a dairy sustainability and quality scheme, while at processing level, Bord Bia&#8217;s Origin Green Programme is providing a vehicle for industry to commit itself to sustainability targets by reducing energy inputs, minimising overall carbon footprint and mitigating the impact on the environment.  This pro-active approach to environmental sustainability has a strong resonance with procurement strategists in the many multi-national food companies who are interested in using Ireland as a source of high quality food ingredients and processed products. <\/p><p><br \/>  The industry itself has a responsibility to focus its efforts on market and product development and to mitigate the impact of price volatility.  Supported by Government, the Irish dairy sector has succeeded in positioning itself as a major international player, and in recent months we have seen industry announcements in relation to the development of supply arrangements between Irish companies and multinational players in third countries, and the development of value added products which can maximise the value of our dairy output.  For my part I have been working on a number of fronts to prepare the industry for the move to a quota free environment.  I have been endeavouring to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector in third country markets, for example through trade visits to the US and China. <\/p><p><br \/>  At farm level my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has been working, through research activities and through the Dairy Efficiency Programme, to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to reduce costs on farm and improve efficiency, in order to better equip farmers to deal with volatility in dairy markets.  In this context I am confident that following quota abolition, co-ops and their members will develop the kind of robust contractual arrangements which will secure supply into the future. <\/p><p><br \/>  Underpinning all of this, I will continue to negotiate strongly to ensure that the post 2013 CAP continues to provide effective support for Irish farmers and that market supports will remain in place to provide a safety net to protect against the worst extremes of price volatility.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Taking all this into account, I am confident that the collaborative efforts of Government, the processing industry and milk producers will ensure a thriving and sustainable dairy sector that can use the opportunity afforded by the abolition of quotas to fully leverage the natural advantage of Ireland&#8217;s grass-based production system.   My Department and its agencies will continue to play their part in providing an appropriate framework to support the development of this critically important industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":1219,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[56262\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the competitiveness of Irish food exports on world markets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1221,"content":"<p>The National Competitiveness Scorecard, which benchmarks Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness against key competitors, has indicated that between April 2008 and April 2012, Ireland&rsquo;s nominal Harmonised Competitiveness Index (HCI) fell by 7.6%, while the real HCI fell by almost 15.25%.<\/p><p>  (The nominal HCI is a nominal effective exchange rate for the Irish economy that reflects, on a trade weighted basis, movements in the exchange rate vis-a vis 56 trading partners.

Ireland has worldwide access to markets for dairy products to markets and already exports such products to over eighty countries.    . <\/p><p>  While the great majority of our meat exports are destined for other EU member states, it is always beneficial to have a wide range of outlets available for our high quality food products.

My Department has also hosted visits in the past few years by official delegations from Morocco (beef access), Israel (beef and sheepmeat access), Philippines (beef access), Australia (pork access), China (pork and beef access), Egypt (beef access), South Korea (pork access), Japan (beef access), Hong Kong (all meats) and Iran (beef and sheepmeat access) as part of our efforts to gain access for Irish meats to these rapidly growing markets. <\/p><p>  Longer term targets for Irish meat access include China for beef and lamb, and Japan for beef.  Other targeted markets for access include Irish beef and lamb to the North African and Middle East regions and my Department is engaging actively with the authorities in these countries. There is a strong demand for meat globally and my Department remains focused, in consultation with the industry, on ensuring that Irish exporters are in a position to take full advantage of the opportunities that arise.

I have been working to encourage more new entrants to take up farming as a career.  Budget  2013 saw the extension of key reliefs that were already in place for young new entrants (such as the 100% relief from Stamp Duty and the 100% stock relief for Young Trained Farmers).  Extending these reliefs is not straightforward given that there is a requirement for EU State Aid approval for such measures.  The deputy will also be aware that changes were made to retirement relief in budget 2012 to encourage inter-generational land transfers.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I am delighted that the number of applicants for Teagasc courses has greatly increased the last two years.  Teagasc has responded well to this demand have introduced new courses to cater for a variety of needs.  For example Teagasc has recently launched a new Professional Diploma in Dairy Farm Management (Level 7) in association with University College Dublin (UCD). Teagasc have also developed recently a new<i><\/i>  Level 6 Specific Purpose Certificate in Farm Administration course to help meet the training requirements for full-time or part-time farmers. In addition, they have also consulted with the banking sector to make sure that their students know how to prepare business plans and detailed cash-flow plans in support of credit applications. <\/p><p><br \/>  Measures to provide targeted support to young farmers are part of the current negotiations on the reform of the CAP and will I hope form part of any final agreement.  I have strongly supported the proposal for a top-up for young farmers under pillar 1 of the CAP, and indeed Ireland was one of the first countries to suggest this measure in the negotiations.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am also happy that the new restructuring relief has been announced in the2013 budget.  This is the result of detailed work which analysed the reasons why the old consolidation relief was not working.  I am confident that the new relief in relation to Capital Gains Taxes will be more effective, especially given that Stamp Duty rates have been reduced.  Re-structuring is essential for us to meet the Food Harvest 2020 targets.  We need to use land more productively and encourage more young farmers to make the best use of the land. A recent EU Commission study found that &#8216;<i>younger[farm] managers tend to perform better than the EU average, with 46% more area and 57% more economic potential for 21% more labour force<\/i>&#8217;<sup> [[1]<\/sup>  Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, CAP towards 2020, <i>Annex 1: Situation and prospects for EU agriculture and rural areas<\/i>  , p. 25. Brussels, 12\/10\/2011.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has a very low level of land sales, with most land staying within the same family for generations. Only 0.4% of land changes hand in any given year.  Young farmers that want to expand need to be able to access land.  According to the latest census of agriculture the average farm has 3.8 land parcels.  This means that our farmers are wasting time and diesel driving between plots of land, increasing the stress and the risk of accidents.  Young farmers will now have an opportunity to consolidate their holdings and increase efficiency.  <\/p><p><br \/>  I am hopeful therefore that the measures that I have introduced will encourage more young people into farming and address the age profile imbalance in Irish farming.<\/p><p><br \/>  The costs of tax incentives is a matter for the Revenue Commissioner in the first instance.  However, the new measures are designed to encourage activity that was not taking place in the absence of such initiatives.  While there will technically be some tax foregone, the fact is that this tax was not being collected because the sale and re-structuring of land parcels was previously minimal.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY02500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Appeals","counter":1240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1241,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[56327\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY02600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a 2012 disadvantaged area scheme payment will issue to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1242,"content":"<p>The appeal of the person named was recently forwarded to the DAS Appeals Committee for consideration; immediately that Committee has adjudicated on this appeal, the person concerned will be notified of their decision, in writing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Applications","counter":1243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1244,"qnumday":522,"qnumall":"[56355\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY02800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding the outstanding disadvantaged area payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1245,"content":"<p>As processing of the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme application has recently been finalised, payment will shortly issue to the nominated bank account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY02900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":1247,"qnumday":523,"qnumall":"[56356\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding disadvantaged area payment and rep schem 4 payment in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1248,"content":"<p>As processing of the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme application has recently been finalised, payment will shortly issue to the nominated bank account.<\/p><p>  The person named commenced REPS 4 in May 2008 and received payments for the first four years of their contract.<\/p><p>  REPS 4 is a measure under the current 2007-13 Rural Development Programme and is subject to EU Regulations which require detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before any payments can issue.

However, the volumes of traffic currently parking at the Fishery Harbour, both during the working week and at weekends, are creating significant health and safety risks, to the extent that on some occasions access for emergency service vehicles is compromised.  <\/p><p>  A number of traffic and parking management enhancements are being carried out at present, and further improvements are in planning.  These measures will have cost implications and I am required to ensure that the Fishery Harbour Centres are run on a financially sound basis.  It is in that context that it is proposed to make a charge for the use of parking facilities provided within the Fishery Harbour Centre, in the same way that a charge is made for using any of its other facilities.  <\/p><p>  I am convinced that the revenues generated by the introduction of such charges will provide the funds to develop and enhance the Fishery Harbour Centre for all its users.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY03700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Stocking Densities","counter":1258,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY03750"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":527,"qnumall":"[56368\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY03800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when payment on stocking density appeal will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"974","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1260,"content":"<p>The appeal of the person named was recently forwarded to the DAS Appeals Committee for consideration; immediately that Committee has adjudicated on this appeal, the person concerned will be notified of their decision, in writing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY03900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fish Quotas","counter":1261,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY03950"},{"type":"question","counter":1262,"qnumday":528,"qnumall":"[56375\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800088#WRY04000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"not to proceed with the current proposals to distribute the boar fish allocation on an open draw basis, as the nine boats who caught their allocation in the 400 tonne boat allocation sector in the Spring should get their share of the allocation of which they were promised; his views on whether the current proposals to allocate on an open draw, one pair quota system is unjust and unfair; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1263,"content":"<p>As of 31\/10\/2012 the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) advised that 4,350 tonnes of Boarfish quota remained, this cannot be carried forward to 2013. A small amount was retained for a by-catch.   <\/p><p><br \/>  In order to ensure that this quota was fully utilised it was important to manage the allocations from a practical and economic perspective, in the most effective way possible.  The re-allocation of quota at the end of October was subject to vessels having landed 65% of their catch-limit by 31\/10\/12. Given the numbers which qualified under this arrangement, a proportional division to all vessels would, in my view, not have provided the optimum management arrangements for the fishery. Based on the fishing pattern available there was a very real likelihood that a substantial portion of the quota would remain uncaught and because it could not be carried forward to 2013, entirely lost to the industry.<\/p><p><br \/>  For this reason, I decided the industry should determine the number of vessels in both the ring fenced portion and open fishery which should be given an allocation taking account of the practicalities and economics of the fishery.  The amount available was allocated in the existing ratio of 85% for the ring fenced group 15% for open fishery.   In line with the published management arrangements, only vessels which landed 65% of their allocation\/catch-limit in the first fishing period were considered for the re-allocation.   <\/p><p><br \/>  The FIF recommend the allocations and vessel numbers for the re-allocation as the industry themselves are best placed to fully understand the vessel numbers and allocations which would assist with a full utilisation of the national quota. A draw was held, witnessed by Industry representatives in which  two pairs were drawn from the non allocated group which received 322 tonnes per pair and two pairs from the ring fenced group which received 1200 tonnes per pair.<\/p><p><br \/>  The deputy refers to a promise which I take to mean in relation to reallocation.

Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.

All staff receiving such a referral are trained in the duty system and are obliged to to treat seriously all child welfare and protection concerns whatever their source.  Once a report has been made the screening stage deals with the information reported and preliminary enquiries are concerned with formulating an appropriate response.  At this stage teams will also screen out those enquiries, reports, requests for service etc that do not fall within the responsibility of the Child Welfare and Protection team. <\/p><p><br \/>  Once it is agreed by the Duty Team Leader that it is a correct referral the case is allocated immediately for an Initial Assessment.  This is a time limited process to allow that gathering of sufficient information on the needs and risks within a case so that informed decisions and recommendations can be made and actions that will result in better outcomes for children are taken.  In identifying risk it is the professional judgement of the duty team leader to assess if immediate action is required.  Risk is assessed if the child is at ongoing significant risk.  This is decided based on the information received with the referral, the seriousness of the abuse reported, the likely level of risk to the future safety and welfare of the child and the degree of professional confidence in the information that either the abuse has occurred and is likely to be repeated or that the child is at immediate risk.  An ongoing process of risk analysis continues throughout the period of the initial assessment. <\/p><p><br \/>  The duty team leader, together with members of the team, will categorise the information received under the following categories:-<\/p><p>- level 1 - child and family must be seen immediately<\/p><p>- level 2 - child and family must be seem within 3 days<\/p><p>- level 3 - child and family must be seem within 7 days<\/p><p><br \/>  Comprehensive information on the extensive process is available on the HSE website under the Standardised Business Process documentation.<\/p><p><br \/>  As regards the average length of time to deal with issues arising, the Deputy will be aware that the HSE compiles monthly performance reports which provide an overall analysis of key performance data.  In the area of children and family services this suite of indicators has recently been expanded to include new indicators aimed at capturing the responsiveness of services to referrals of concerns.  These indicators include details of the number of referrals to child welfare and protection teams in the reporting period, the number of such referrals where a preliminary assessment took place within 24 hours, the number leading to initial assessments and the number of such assessments completed within 21 days. <\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, the new Child and Family Support Agency with dedicated responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services is to be established.

This is the reality of the context in which I seek to deliver on all my commitments in relation to children and young people.  As part of our efforts to address Ireland&rsquo;s deficit, my Department, like all others, has had to find savings.  However our overall approach has been to prioritise investment in child and family services and to reform funding streams and delivery mechanisms in order to make the best possible use of resources.  The Deputy will be aware of the wide - ranging reform of children's services that is underway and will see the establishment next year of the Child and Family Support Agency dedicated to the improvement of these services through the combination of the activities and resources of the Family Support Agency, the National Education Welfare Board and the child and family services of the HSE.  The Agency will have available to it a much stronger and more comprehensive range of resources and expertise than heretofore. <\/p><p>  The focus of the Agency will be on early intervention and family support services, aimed at delivering 'proportionate' responses to child welfare concerns and to protect children in the home, as envisaged by the Constitutional amendment.  This approach will be supported by the inclusion of the existing Family Support Agency and its nationwide network of 106 Family Resource Centres.<\/p><p>  In addition, I am pleased to say that the new &lsquo;Area Based Approach to Child Poverty&rsquo; initiative for which &euro;2.5 million has been provided for in the 2013 Estimates, will build on and continue the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) which supported projects in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale.  These projects involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour.<\/p><p>  In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that follow through on the proposal to amend the Constitution is a top priority for me, and I will make the necessary resources available within my Department to do so effectively. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800091#WRBB01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":1421,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[57040\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800091#WRBB02000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she had identified deficiencies in services for children and youth; her proposals to address such matters in the short, medium and long-term; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1422,"content":"<p>Under Section 8 of the Child Care Act, 1991 the Health Service Executive (HSE) prepares an annual report on the adequacy of child care and family support services, known as the \"Review of Adequacy for HSE Children and Families Services Reports\".

Children are more likely to be poor if they are living in lone parent households with low labour market participation and dependant on income support.  The departments of Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, are working to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work. <\/p><p>  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection in a &lsquo;whole of Government approach&rsquo; to tackling poverty in the population.  The Department is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare established by the Minister for Social Protection to examine issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children&rsquo;s outcomes is my primary objective.  The development of the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework as the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State, is an important initiative for cross departmental collaboration to secure this objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children&rsquo;s opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment.  The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard. <\/p><p>  The Programme for Government committed to reviewing the homeless strategy, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland 2008-2013, and to implementing a housing led approach to homelessness.  Work on the review is almost complete and my colleague the Minister for Housing &amp; Planning, Depuy Jan O Sullivan intends to issue a policy statement on homelessness shortly.  That statement will take account of demands on existing housing and will assess how best to continue providing services in a manner consistent with the elimination of existing homelessness and to ensure more effective prevention strategies.  The Minister will be indicating what she expects from housing authorities and other stakeholders in accelerating progress towards realising the ambition of eliminating involuntary long-term homelessness.<\/p><p>  With regard to my own responsibility, my priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.

The greater the registrant base the lower the annual fee charged.  Given the enormous registrant base in teaching and nursing, for example, the annual fee charged amounts to less than &euro;100 per annum.  Health regulators are single profession regulators whereas the Council is charged with regulating twelve disparate professions, which can add significantly to operating costs.  The twelve designated professions to be registered by the Council range in number from under 50 Clinical Biochemists to 5,550 Social Care Workers, which amounts to about 20,000 registrants in total across all professions.  This is an extremely low registrant base when compared to a registrant base of well in excess of 60,000 for nurses.<\/p><p>  The Council has extensive statutory functions under the 2005 Act, and considers the annual fee of &euro;295 the minimum required to enable it to operate.

This concession will only apply to existing practitioners availing of the transitional provisions set out in the Act;<\/p><p>- The Council has entered into discussions with the HSE in regard to the feasibility of arrangements for the deduction of the registration fee from monthly salary thereby spreading the cost throughout the year;<\/p><p>- Finally, the Council has proposed significant restructuring of the way in which the designated professions will be registered and regulated to provide a more cost effective operating system and keep costs to a minimum.

The workings of the National Elder Abuse Steering Committee and the Area Elder Abuse Steering Groups are supported by Dedicated Officers for the Protection of Older People. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Deputy will be aware that, under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, as part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), for the independent registration and inspection of all designated centres providing residential services for older people.    This regime is underpinned by a regulatory framework including Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards.<\/p><p><br \/>  Under the regulations the registered provider must ensure that all reasonable measures are taken to protect residents from all forms of abuse.  The person in charge must notify the Chief Inspector of any allegation of abuse, suspected or confirmed, of any resident.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition, all designated centres providing residential services for older people must have complaints processes and procedures in place as required by Article 39 of the Care and Welfare Regulations.  The Regulations require that all designated centres must have an independent appeals process in place.  In some situations the Senior Case Worker may be invited by the provider to advise or assist in an assessment of an elder abuse allegation.<\/p><p><br \/>  If the HSE receives an allegation of elder abuse in any designated centre the HSE should in turn report this to HIQA and to the proprietor of the home.  HIQA welcomes information about any designated centre.   It records this information and the next steps the Authority takes will depend on the seriousness of the concern. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Chief Inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration, or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with relevant regulations or standards.<\/p><p><b>HIQA inspections<\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Part 9 Section 72 of the Health Act 2007 provides for the appointment of qualified persons to assist the Chief Inspector. Senior Case Workers may be requested to accompany inspectors on inspections in accordance with Section 72 of the Health Act, 2007.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC00500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":1456,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC00525"},{"type":"question","counter":1457,"qnumday":595,"qnumall":"[56238\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card will be restored to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1458,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.\t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motorised Transport Grant","counter":1459,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1460,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[56239\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a primary medical certificate and or a motorised transport grant will issue in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1461,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":1462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1463,"qnumday":597,"qnumall":"[56243\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if refusal of a medical card on income grounds can be reviewed or set aside in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1464,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.\t<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobility Allowance Rates","counter":1465,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1466,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[56281\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800092#WRCC01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the monthly rates for mobility allowance that will apply in 2013","asker":"1178","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1467,"content":"<p>There is no change to the monthly rate for mobility allowance for 2013.

The Department&rsquo;s policy objective remains to ensure that all schemes meet the requirements of the Equal Status Acts while endeavouring to make sure that those who currently receive the grant, and rely on it, are protected as far as possible.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman recommended that the Department should revise the definition of disability in the circular governing the Motorised Transport Grant having regard to the broad definition of disability set out in the Equal Status Acts. <\/p><p>  To be eligible for the Motorised Transport Grant an applicant must have a severe functional disability such as an inability to walk.  The Ombudsman recommends that this definition be expanded to include a very broad definition of disability which is contained in the Equal Status Acts which encompasses all conditions that can amount to a disability. <\/p><p>  There are a lot of difficulties in estimating the possible costs of expanding the definition of disability in the case of the Motorised Transport Grant.  Accurate figures in relation to the number of people covered by the definition of disability in the Equal Status Acts and the numbers who would fail the means test are very difficult to ascertain.  However, the expansion of the definition of disability has the potential to result in a colossal exponential increase in the cost of the grant to the HSE.  The Central Statistics Office in its publication in November 2012 &quot;Census 2011 - Profile 8 - Our Bill of Health&quot; identified 542,277 people aged 15 and over with a disability of which 112,502 were at work. <\/p><p>  The Motorised Transport Grant is a Health Service Executive payment to enable a person with a severe disability to purchase or adapt a car where that car is essential to retain employment. The maximum grant is &euro;5,020 every three years.  Over 300 people receive the grant each year.<\/p><p>  Having regard to the possible number of people that would become eligible for the grant should the definition of disability be expanded as recommended by the Ombudsman, the Department is now considering the overall position of the Motorised Transport Grant.  Expansion of the definition would impose serious financial constraints on the Department, the HSE and the State generally.  The recommendations, if implemented as outlined, would create liabilities that the State could not afford. <\/p><p>  Therefore, while it is difficult to predict, taking the various factors into account, the possible additional cost could, at least, be in excess of &euro;200m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800093#WRDD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Cases","counter":1517,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800093#WRDD00350"},{"type":"question","counter":1518,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[56467\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800093#WRDD00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide in tabular form for 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total compensation, and the associated volume of cases, paid by his Department in respect of legal actions taken on foot of the 1970 Health Act and the failure of his Department to provide places in public nursing homes.","asker":"959","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1519,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[56636\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800093#WRDD00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide in tabular form for 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012 the total compensation, and the associated volume of cases, paid by his Department in respect of legal actions taken on foot of the 1970 Health Act and the failure of his Department to provide places in public nursing homes.","asker":"959","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1520,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 615 and 629 together.<\/p><p>  Public nursing home care has, in line with the policy of successive Governments since the introduction of the Health Act 1970, been provided within the annual resources available for long term care.

Maternal mortality is a rare occurrence in Ireland.  It must be understood that since there are usually fewer than 5 such deaths per year, rates can appear to fluctuate significantly from year to year.  For example, an increase in deaths from 2 to 4 in a given year would lead to an apparent 100% increase in the maternal mortality rate.  Because of this, reports based on data from different years can appear to be contradictory.  <\/p><p>  It is generally recognised internationally that official vital statistics can result in an underestimate of maternal deaths.  In particular, indirect obstetric deaths resulting from previous existing disease or diseases which developed during the pregnancy may be missed in the official statistics.  For this reason, Ireland established a Confidential Maternal Death Enquiry (MDE) system in 2009.  In doing so, it linked itself with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Confidential MDE which has been acknowledged as a gold standard for maternal death enquiry in recent decades.  The recently published report of Ireland&rsquo;s Confidential MDE for the period 2009 to 2011 cannot be compared with civil registration-based rates of other EU countries which do not have MDE systems.  Comparison with the UK&rsquo;s MDE for the period 2006 to 2008 showed Ireland with a rate about 30% lower than the UK.  Again, however, caution must be exercised in interpreting this data since, even when aggregating 3 years of data (i.e. 2009 to 2011), numbers of deaths remain small and the rates will be subject to significant fluctuation.<\/p><p>  The recent MDE report for Ireland makes a number of very valuable recommendations both with respect to clinical care and in the area of improved ascertainment of cases.  A key recommendation for improving completeness of official statistics is the inclusion of a question on pregnancy status at time of death on the Coroner&rsquo;s Death Certificate along the same lines as is already included on the Medical Death Notification Form.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800094#WREE03200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1620,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800094#WREE03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1621,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[56900\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800094#WREE03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will confirm that the Health Service Executive commissioned KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the greater Dublin area, published in 2008, found a 30% shortfall in necessary obstetric, midwifery, neonatal and theatre staff to meet international standards for safe care; and if in view of recorded recent maternal deaths in hospitals in the greater Dublin area, those staff shortages have been dealt with in full","asker":"1015","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1622,"content":"<p>A comprehensive review of maternity and gynaecology services in the greater Dublin area was completed in 2008.  The KPMG Independent Review of Maternity and Gynaecology Services in the Greater Dublin area identified the need to increase consultant and midwife staffing  levels and  recommended the recruitment of additional staff  across the three Dublin sites. The staff numbers required, as outlined in the KPMG report, were based on the current model of service provision, the report noted that this  would  need to be reconsidered and a detailed manpower plan developed as and when the future service model is implemented, taking into account workforce needs, demand, configuration with other obstetric\/gynaecology units and related acute services staffing (eg anaesthetics) and primary care services (eg community midwifery). The report also noted that Dublin&rsquo;s model of stand alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and recommended that the Dublin maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult acute services and that one of the three new Dublin maternity facilities should be built on the site of the new national paediatric hospital. Maternity and paediatric service co-location has advantages for infants with congenital malformations, for foetal medicine or complications which require neonatal surgery.  Maternity and adult service co-location has advantages for mothers in providing on-campus rapid and ready access to non-obstetric specialist expertise, and to specialist surgery and intensive care in the case of major obstetric emergency.<\/p><p>  In this context the proposal in 2008 was that the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St Vincent's, the Coombe to Tallaght and the Rotunda to the Mater, and the maternity hospitals have been working with the relevant adult sites to progress this.

The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), in its report \"The evaluation of the use of resources in the national population-based cancer screening programmes and associated services \" in 2009, noted that, based on a literature review, the age range and screening interval adopted by the BreastCheck Programme in Ireland appeared to be consistent with the international evidence base.  However, in keeping with the recommendations of the EU Advisory Committee on Cancer Prevention, HIQA also noted that it would be appropriate to extend the age range to 69 years.  The Programme for Government includes the extension of BreastCheck to women in the 65-69 age group, in keeping with these recommendations. <\/p><p>  The main priority for the HSE's National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) at present is to maximise national uptake in the 50-64 year age cohort.  The extension of the BreastCheck programme has been listed as a priority in the HSE's 3 year Corporate Plan (2012 -2015).  The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme is examining how it can extend the programme to 65-69 year olds.  A review of the BreastCheck screening process, commissioned this year by my Department from the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health in UCC and the Centre for Health Policy and Management in Trinity College, has just been submitted to my officials.  This review will help to inform how greater efficiencies may be achieved within the Programme in order to extend the age range at the earliest date.   The Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service estimates that this will be in 2014.  <\/p><p>  In the meantime women of any age who have concerns about breast cancer should seek the advice of their GP who will, if appropriate, refer them to the symptomatic breast services in one of the eight designated specialist cancer centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800095#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Staff","counter":1648,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800095#WRFF01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1649,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[56979\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012121800095#WRFF01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a report given to the Health Service Executive almost ten months ago relative to the care of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny will be acted on;
