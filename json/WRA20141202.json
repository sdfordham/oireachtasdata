The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent). Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.   On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012 and extended it nationally in June 2012.

Subject to the completion of drafting, I intend to progress the Bill as a priority during the Spring Oireachtas session.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200054#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Expenditure","counter":104,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200054#WRB02350"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[40950\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200054#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the estimated annual operational costs of the Irish Water company in 2014, 2015 and 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":106,"content":"<p>The establishment of Irish Water is an integral component of the Government&rsquo;s water sector reform strategy and involves major organisational change.

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities.  The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.  Under section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, as amended, HAP is deemed to be a social housing support and, consequently, households in receipt of HAP are not entitled to remain on the local authority waiting list for social housing support. However, HAP recipients may access other social housing supports by applying to go on the local authority transfer list.<\/p><p>  HAP has been rolled out in seven local authority areas on a pilot basis. As an immediate step, I have issued a statutory direction to the seven authorities involved, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefiting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option. I have also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list. In practice, housing authorities inform HAP recipients in writing of their entitlement to apply to go on the transfer list when they are approved for HAP.<\/p><p>  Prior to the full roll-out of HAP, my Department will undertake a review of the transfer option with the seven pilot authorities. This will inform the overall review of the housing allocation system which is a key action under the Social Housing Strategy.

If speculation on Bitcoin occurs, then the taxation rules that would apply to any gain are applicable.<\/p><p>  More specifically, VAT is generally chargeable on the total consideration for goods and services, including all taxes, commissions, costs, and charges (excluding the VAT chargeable in respect of that supply).  This general rule is based on the EU VAT Directive. Where the consideration does not consist of, or does not consist wholly of, an amount of money, VAT is chargeable by reference to what might reasonably be expected to be the open-market (arm's length) price of the goods or services supplied. The VAT Regulations require that the amount of tax included on an invoice be expressed in Euro. The exchange rate to be used for non-Euro currency transactions is either the latest selling rate for the foreign currency recorded by the European Central Bank or an alternative method of determining the exchange rate that is agreed with Revenue.<\/p><p>  I am advised that Revenue has continued to monitor developments in Bitcoin (and other such currencies) during 2014. This includes using international fora to follow progress in other countries, in particular other Member States of the EU. However, as Bitcoin features a combination of some factors that constitute a commodity and some that constitute a currency, the implications for taxation are varied and there is as yet no consensus on the &quot;best practice&quot; approach for a tax administration.  Bitcoin also requires a coordinated response between Revenue, my Department and the Central Bank of Ireland.<\/p><p>  While Bitcoin has the potential to be misused and lead to instances of non-compliance and tax evasion, I am advised that, at this point in time, the threat posed to the Exchequer is likely to be small.

A\u00a0total of 175 samples of petrol from Filling Stations and other sources have been taken for analysis following checks conducted from June 2014 to date.  The scientific analysis required is complex and time consuming and the State Laboratory has conducted extensive tests and re-tests on the samples.  Normally, when fraudsters attempt to &quot;stretch&quot; petrol, they add methanol, kerosene or other low excise duty agents.  Despite extensive testing by the State Laboratory, no evidence of the presence of methanol, kerosene or any other known prohibited stretching agent has been found in any of the samples, except two samples taken from one site on the eastern seaboard.  The conclusive results received in that particular case has resulted in seizure of the product, closure of the facility and a file is being prepared for prosecution.<\/p><p>  Following a series of further tests conducted by the State Laboratory, results have been received in recent days which indicate the presence of traces of road diesel in several samples taken from a variety of locations (including Co Mayo) during August and September.  This could indicate that petrol was contaminated with road diesel at some point in time.  There is no rational economic reason or fraudulent incentive for anyone to deliberately mix normal road diesel with petrol.  This contamination could have taken place earlier in the summer, well ahead of the problems manifesting themselves in cars in Co Mayo and elsewhere.  <\/p><p>  If the problems that have come to light were caused by an unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed into petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved.  However, the Deputies can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems. In any instances where the analysis of petrol samples by the State Laboratory indicates the presence of illegal stretching agents, Revenue will take swift and robust action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible. <\/p><p>  In regard to the Deputy's question regarding new complaints in Co Mayo, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have received a total of 19 additional complaints from the public in Co. Mayo since 2 October 2014 (16 in October and 3 in November) with regard to problems relating to petrol quality, and suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching.  <\/p><p>  The\u00a0Revenue Commissioners are continuing their investigation in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The investigation includes sharing of information and intelligence and intensive monitoring of the situation.<\/p><p>  Revenue are continuing to sample suspect fuel and to challenge fuel delivery tankers when encountered by Enforcement officers particularly throughout the Border Midlands West Region. No cases of contaminated petrol have been identified as a result of these checks from June 2014 to date.  In Co Mayo 6 fuel delivery tankers were stopped and inspected during the month of October.  In the time available it is not possible to provide national figures.<\/p><p>  In regard to the Deputy's question regarding fuel import and distribution centres, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that such centres must be approved by them as Authorised Warehouses.  Once approved, an authorised warehouse-keeper is at all times responsible for the duty on all oil products in the warehouse and must ensure that the oil in the warehouse is safeguarded and properly and fully accounted for.  Revenue maintains a permanent presence of control staff at the main Mineral Oil import depots throughout the country.  These officers engage on a daily basis with the authorised warehouse keepers and industry personnel on all compliance matters relating to oil, supervision of warehouse activities, approval of warehouse requests, accounting for excise duties and VAT, accounting for Customs duty, provision of statistics, and generally ensuring compliance by the various oil companies with relevant Revenue regulations.  <\/p><p>  In addition, as part of its routine compliance work Revenue actively monitor the mineral oil sector through analysis of monthly Return of Oil Movements and supply chain data. Any anomalies or breaches of Regulations detected are fully investigated as a matter of course.  <\/p><p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the main mineral oil distributors take daily samples of imported fuel on which they carry out quality assurance checks.  I have no plans currently to introduce testing at point of importation but I will of course keep the matter under review.<\/p><p>  I wish to assure the Deputy I am satisfied the Revenue Commissioners are taking all possible actions to identify the problem and challenge any instances of identified fuel fraud including, where possible, pursuing prosecutions against offenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200057#WRE04800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Costs","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200057#WRE04900"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[45815\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200057#WRE05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in view of the high cost of child care facing many families throughout the country, his views on implementing tax relief for those faced with these costs; his plans to assist those who are struggling with these costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1014","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":247,"content":"<p>Tax relief is not available to parents in respect\u00a0of cr&egrave;che fees or childcare costs.\u00a0However, I would like to assure the\u00a0Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children. In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying\u00a0Solas and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school. Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided.<\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and additionally to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer\u00a0tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000.

However, this relief was abolished in Finance Act 2011. The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employers did not provide such facilities.<\/p><p>  I\u00a0have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs. To provide such a tax relief could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children.

In addition, it has also been brought to the Revenue Commissioners' attention by a concerned tax practitioner that this exemption is subject to widespread abuse. The full extent to which this exemption is being abused cannot be determined because CAT is a self-assessment tax and there is no obligation to submit returns to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of any benefit that is legally exempt from tax under Section 82. <\/p><p>  The amendment to section 82(2) is intended to ensure, where there is a need to make provision for support, maintenance or education of children, that the exemption is confined to normal and reasonable payments made to minor children; to children under the age of 25 years who are in full-time education and to children regardless of age who are permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining themselves. <\/p><p>  It is important to note that, apart from this particular exemption, parents can make gifts to their children within certain limits, without giving rise to a CAT liability.

However, there are a number of technical and timing issues relating to EU implementation of fiscal rules which need to be resolved.  For example, the expenditure benchmark links growth in expenditure to the potential growth rate of the economy.\u00a0  The updated Commission projections on potential growth, on which assessment with the benchmark would be based, were not available in advance of the Budget.  As these estimates can display significant revisions, there was no solid basis to forecast assessed expenditure in the outer years.  This limitation was specifically\u00a0highlighted in the budgetary documentation.  A fuller assessment will be contained in the SPU in April.  With regard to the revenue forecasts not reflecting Government's intention to reduce the tax burden in coming years, I would strongly make the point that this is the correct approach to take.  What is reflected in the budgetary arithmetic is what is being legislated for in the coming year.  Budgets cannot be framed on the basis of general policy principles such as that to reduce the level of income tax in the future.  These decisions will be taken on an annual basis taking account of the economic and fiscal situation at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200058#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200058#WRF00500"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[45884\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200058#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the annual cost of the artists exemption tax relief in each year from 2005 to 2013; the number of persons benefitting in each year; his plans to review the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>The information regarding the annual cost and numbers availing of the Artists' Exemption\u00a0is set out in the table for the years 2005 to 2012, the most recent figures available.

In this case, where a charity produces a CD and supplies it themselves, it will be exempt from VAT in Ireland.

Supplies of electronically supplied music into Europe, for the most part, are made from Luxembourg, where the VAT charged on these sales is at the standard VAT rate applying in Luxembourg.  From 1 January 2015 the place of supply for electronically supplied music, including charity singles, will be the place of the consumer, and as such sales of electronically supplied music to Irish consumers will be liable to Irish VAT.

Indeed,\u00a0the Economic and Fiscal Outlook that accompanied Budget 2015 contained a box on the issue\u00a0to which\u00a0the Deputy may wish to refer if he requires\u00a0a detailed explanation of the impact of\u00a0contracted production:().  However, it is important to stress that the contribution of contracted production to growth cannot be calculated with precision with the publicly available data to hand. <br\/><br\/>It should be recalled that\u00a0large movements in GDP relating to activities of the foreign-owned\u00a0sector in Ireland are not new. Foreign-owned\u00a0firms are generally large, high-turnover enterprises concentrated in certain sectors. As such firm-specific and product-specific devleopments\u00a0can have a bearing on measured GDP.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding these developments\u00a0relating to contracted production,\u00a0there is no doubt that economic recovery has gained momentum this year and that it has broadened to include a recovery in domestic demand.\u00a0 High-frequency data such as retail sales, industrial production\u00a0and purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) are all in strong positive territory.  Employment growth resumed in 2012 and the Live Register continues to fall month-on-month.

However, I would like to assure the\u00a0Deputy that the Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children.  In recognition of these cost pressures, a number of support measures are in place to ease the burden on working parents.  These include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which funds community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to qualifying parents, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which provides free childcare places to qualifying\u00a0Solas and VEC trainees and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school.  Generous entitlements to paid and unpaid maternity leave as well as child benefit payments are also provided. <\/p><p>  The Department of Social Protection provides financial support to families on low pay by way of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) and additionally to one-parent families through the one-parent family payment. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer\u00a0tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000.  This credit and band\u00a0is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated.<\/p><p>  A\u00a0relief did exist in the form of\u00a0a benefit-in-kind exemption, where\u00a0childcare\u00a0facilities were provided by an employer.  However, this relief was abolished in Finance Act 2011.  The Commission on Taxation recommended the abolition of this exemption, citing equity issues in relation to those parents whose employers did not provide such facilities.<\/p><p>  I\u00a0have no plans to introduce a tax relief for parents to assist with childcare costs.  To provide such a tax relief could be seen to unfairly discriminate against those individuals who stay at home and look after their children.  While wanting to\u00a0encourage\u00a0participation in the workforce, equally we cannot say to individuals who stay at home that they are making a less\u00a0valuable contribution to society. <\/p><p>  In addition, tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2014, 39% of income earners will be exempt from income tax altogether.  It could also be argued that any tax relief\u00a0would most likely be absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will\u00a0appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones.  In considering these,\u00a0I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer given the current budgetary constraints.  Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200059#WRG00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200059#WRG00550"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[46030\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200059#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have begun to apply VAT to certain food supplements such as probiotics and glucosamine which had been supplied at the zero VAT rate; his views on the cost implications of this for consumers with dietary requirements and deficiencies; and his further views on amending legislation to enshrine the zero VAT rate that had always applied to food supplements that provide sustenance.

The on-lending model has many advantages over direct lending and is designed to ensure that as much of the benefit of the SBCI's lower funding cost is passed onto SMEs.  This helps the SBCI to maintain a lean operation and avoids as much operational overhead as possible.  Also, the SBCI can better deliver on one of its key goals i.e. that of diversifying the SME finance market by operating as an wholesale lender rather than entering the SME finance market directly.  The SBCI's focus is to facilitate the funding of new entrants to this market in order to expand the range and profile of SME lenders in Ireland.

It is the on-lenders who will assess the risk of the loan propositions from their customers. <\/p><p>  The SBCI is based on a common and successful on-lending model that is used across Europe and further afield by national promotional banks for example by\u00a0Germany's KfW and Spain's ICO.  The on-lending model has many advantages over direct lending and is designed to ensure that as much of the benefit of the SBCI's lower funding cost is passed onto SMEs.  This helps the SBCI to maintain a lean operation and avoids as much operational overhead as possible.  Also, the SBCI can better deliver on one of its key goals i.e. that of diversifying the SME finance market, by operating as a wholesale lender rather than entering the SME finance market directly.  The SBCI's focus is to facilitate the funding of new entrants to this market in order to expand the range and profile of SME lenders in Ireland.  As a result, enhanced sustainable competition in the SME finance market has the very real potential to improve the terms and conditions offered by finance providers\u00a0to SMEs.<\/p><p>  Section 8 of the SBCI Act 2014 requires the SBCI to ensure that SMEs have sufficient prudent finance to fund their commercial activities and mandates the SBCI to design credit facilities that meet the needs of SMEs.  As a result, part of the\u00a0SBCI's operations will be to analyse\u00a0whether or not the SME sector is receiving the optimum level of credit and service from the market and that may include examining lending conditions.  The SBCI is mandated to design products which address any such problems arising. <\/p><p>  On the issue of appeals, SMEs refused credit from AIB and Bank of Ireland can have their application reviewed by the\u00a0 Credit Review Office where either of these banks are SBCI onlenders.  As announced in my Budget 2015 speech, Permanent tsb will shortly recommence actively lending to the SME sector, and has agreed to participate in the Credit Review Office process, with Ulster Bank actively considering making a similar commitment.  Both would be subject to\u00a0a similar CRO appeal mechanism where they operate as SBCI onlenders.  It is important to note that the SBCI's lending partners hold the risk of the individual SME loans.<\/p><p>  The Credit Review Office will provide the lending partner with an opinion on whether it agrees with a rejected lending proposal or not.  The lending partner can then respond to this opinion and confirms the next steps in response to the recommendations set out by the Credit Review Office.  Where the Credit Review Office has upheld a lending partner's decision not to lend, the opinion will always seek to provide alternatives and guidance to the borrower to help the business move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200059#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Establishment","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200059#WRG02650"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[46087\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200059#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a quarterly statement on the operation of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) Act, 2014 stipulates that the SBCI will present a copy of its annual audited accounts to the Minister.

The value to the child of this gift is an amount equivalent to the income from the investment of an amount equal to the amount of the loan.

However, it is important to point out that, when framing a Budget, the Government does not just consider the fiscal position but also has to consider a number of other issues such as social cohesion and the need to safeguard the ongoing economic recovery.\u00a0<\/p><p>  It should be borne in mind that these benefits will be achieved while still meeting our budgetary targets under the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP).\u00a0 In fact, we are targeting a deficit of 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2015, inside the 2.9 per cent target.  Indeed, I note that the OECD\u00a0in its analysis of Ireland in the recently-published Economic Outlook\u00a0is of the view that this EDP objective will be achieved in 2015, as a budget deficit of 2.9 per cent of GDP is projected. <\/p><p>  As regards the need for further reforms, I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and\u00a0acts as a disincentive for work and investment.\u00a0 The income tax measures announced in the Budget will reduce the burden on working people\u00a0while also securing the economic\u00a0recovery that is under way.  As I outlined on Budget day, my Department estimates a three year reform plan along these lines could boost employment\u00a0by as much as 15,000 jobs when the full impact of the changes has taken effect in the economy.  This will underpin the\u00a0job creation already underway in the economy\u00a0as evidenced by CSO data released\u00a0last week which show\u00a0that more than 80,000 people are at work in Ireland\u00a0compared with the low point of mid-2012.\u00a0<\/p><p>  This Government recognises the role that structural reforms\u00a0can play\u00a0in increasing the capacity of the economy to grow.

These included an increase in the amount of finance that can be raised by a company under the Employment and Investment Incentive to &euro;5 million annually subject to a lifetime maximum of &euro;15 million.

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria.  A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations.  An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual.  The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.<\/p><p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:<\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;<\/p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;<\/p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;<\/p><p>- be without one or both legs;<\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;<\/p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. <\/p><p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;43.5 million to the Exchequer in 2013.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  In terms of the numbers of beneficiaries of the Scheme in 2013, 4,355 citizens availed of the Vehicle Registration Tax and\/or VAT relief, and 11,436 availed of the repayment of excise on fuel element of the Scheme. <\/p><p>  The Department of Finance conducted a review of Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme in 1993, which informed the drafting and enactment of the 1994 Regulations.  As part of the review, the position of single hand amputees was considered given extensive representations made seeking the inclusion of persons without the use of one arm or hand within the qualifying medical criteria.  The review noted that such a disability did not present as serious a challenge to mobility as the extant qualifying criteria, and on that basis, and in the context of limited resources, priority should be given to those citizens with the greatest challenge to their mobility.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, the current context is still one of constrained resources.  I\u00a0recognise\u00a0the important role that the\u00a0Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and\u00a0I have managed\u00a0to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis\u00a0despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation.\u00a0 However, in the still challenging fiscal environment and given the scale and scope of the Scheme,\u00a0I have\u00a0no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200060#WRH01900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Sector Strategy","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200060#WRH01950"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[46281\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200060#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has received an economic impact analysis on a mortgage guarantee scheme as per the Construction 2020 commitment; and if so, if he will publish the document.

Detailed engagement with the Attorney General's office and the Central Bank on draft legislation has commenced and in July and August of this year, my Department ran a public consultation seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.  The Department of Finance received 18 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders.  Officials in my Department are carefully considering the submissions and it is anticipated that legislation will be published by the end of this year.<\/p><p>  The relevant code of conduct that can apply to certain business borrower lender relationships is the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME Code).  The application of the SME Code varies depending on whether the relevant purchasing entity of the commercial loans is a regulated entity or an unregulated entity.

If the purchasing entity is not a regulated entity, it is not required to comply with the SME Code.<\/p><p>  In terms of context, unlike consumer lending, business lending is not an activity which, in and of itself, must be undertaken by a regulated entity i.e. an unregulated entity could be established for the sole purpose of lending to SMEs and this would not require authorisation, and would not be subject to any legislation or codes.<\/p><p>  It is also important to note that the sale of these loans does not change the terms and conditions of the loan agreement in any way.

Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private child care facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  At present, certain child care and pre-school facilities can be exempt from rates under the terms of paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act, 2001, where the organisation is a charitable organisation, that uses its property exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit. The organisation claiming charitable status for the purpose of qualifying for exemption from rates must comply with the definition of &quot;charitable organisation&quot; as stated in PART 1 section 3 of the Valuation Act, 2001. Similarly, certain pre-school facilities can be exempt from rates where \u00a0the conditions detailed in paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 are met.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  Inconsistency in the approach to the exemption from rates of child care and early education facilities was raised at Committee Stage of the Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2012 in the Seanad with Minister of State Simon Harris, who\u00a0was taking the Bill through the Seanad on my behalf. He\u00a0undertook to consider what could be done in this regard. As a result, I got Government approval\u00a0for a Seanad Report Stage amendment to the Bill, to insert into Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 an exemption from rates for\u00a0properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis. This amendment was proposed and passed at Report Stage in the Seanad on 20th November 2014.

As outlined in the Seanad, key valuation principles have to be respected to retain the integrity and equity of a system that\u00a0is a significant source\u00a0of funding for Local Authorities.\u00a0One of those principles is that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit\u00a0are rateable. It is immaterial to the valuation of a property whether the\u00a0occupier of a property, particularly an occupier that\u00a0can make a profit,\u00a0provides a service to the State or provides a service with the support of the State.\u00a0There are a variety of other more appropriate means through which Government can and does support such services. Making exception to core, long-standing valuation principles can have a far reaching negative impact on the rates system and consequently a far reaching impact on Local Government funding.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200061#WRJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships Expenditure","counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200061#WRJ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":407,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[46367\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200061#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views that the current approach of Government in terms of the use of off-balance sheet financing for capital and infrastructure projects across Departments is in fact the best way to finance such projects particularly in terms of value for money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":408,"content":"<p>Public infrastructure is funded primarily in two ways:\u00a0 Exchequer financing (the vast bulk of funding) and PPP-sourced funding for particular projects that are suited to the PPP approach while providing value for money for the State.

As the Deputy will be aware, PPPs have been used in Ireland for over a decade. The main driver for the pursuit of PPPs in Ireland has been the achievement of a value for money (VfM) solution for the Exchequer rather than the achievement of a particular balance sheet status. The Irish government has put in place a number of VfM initiatives designed to secure value in the procurement of all public investment projects including PPPs. In addition to these measures, PPPs are also subject to four specific VfM tests throughout the procurement process in order to determine whether the PPP approach has the potential to deliver a VfM solution.The Deputy will also be aware that we are setting up the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to channel investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) towards productive investment in sectors of strategic importance to the Irish economy. The ISIF will seek to leverage and maximise\u00a0the resources transferred from the NPRF\u00a0by attracting third-party co-investment.

According to the CSO Quarterly Earnings and Labour Costs release of 25th November 2014, average weekly paid hours increased by 0.3% over the Quarter and by 0.6% over the year.    There was a fall in average weekly earnings of -1.9 % over the Quarter and by -0.8 % over the year. Across the economic sectors, weekly earnings increased in 6 of the 13 sectors, most notably in Industry (+3.4%), Construction (+0.2%), in Wholesale and Retail trades (+1.6%) and in the Transportation and Storage (+0.2%), which combined account for 710,000 of those at work. The largest percentage sectoral decrease was recorded in the Professional, Scientific and Technical activities sector, which fell by -5.3%. At the same time, this economic sector experienced one of the largest quarterly employment increases in the latest QNHS - an increase of +5%. It may be that this additional employment comprised newer entrants with relatively lower entrant earnings levels and that this has contributed to the lowering of the average weekly earnings levels in this economic sector. It will require analysis of a number of further QNHS releases to clarify this. In itself therefore, this decrease in average earnings may partially the result of a positive employment recruitment trend. <\/p><p>  The Government is undertaking a number of initiatives to sustain and grow living standards. Following measures introduced in Budget 2015, from January 2015 the standard rate tax band will increase by &euro;1,000: from &euro;32,800 to &euro;33,800 for single people and from &euro;41,800 to &euro;42,800 for married couples with one income. The higher rate of income tax will reduce from 41% to 40%.  The Budget also reduced the two lower rates of USC from 2% and 4% to 1.5% and 3.5%, respectively. And increased the threshold before which the 7% rate of USC becomes payable to &euro;17,576, so that those on the minimum wage will now only be liable to a maximum 3.5% rate of USC. <\/p><p>  The national minimum wage in Ireland is considered to be relatively high by international standards. The most recent figures published by EUROSTAT show that Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the fourth highest among the 21 EU member states that have a national minimum wage. When the cost of living is taken into account, Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the fifth highest.  The decision to restore the national minimum wage to &euro;8.65 per hour, after the cut by the previous Government, with effect from 1 July 2011, together with the decision to put the joint labour committees, JLC, system on a more secure legal and constitutional footing and reinstate a robust system of protection, represents a significant commitment by this Government to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers. <\/p><p>  In addition to Ireland's national minimum wage, JLC and REA structures, we have a system of supports through the Department of Social Protection supporting low income families. <\/p><p>  The Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 contains a commitment to establish a low pay commission on a statutory basis as an independent body to make annual recommendations to the Government about the appropriate level of the national minimum wage and related matters. I am currently developing proposals to implement that commitment. <\/p><p>  However, as noted above, it is the creation of employment that offers the greatest potential to enhance our living standards.  Implementation of the Action Plan for Jobs and the development of the 2015 plan are critical in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200062#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Retail Sector","counter":446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200062#WRK01350"},{"type":"question","counter":447,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[46176\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200062#WRK01400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his estimate of the value of the market for gift vouchers here; the legislative protection that governs such vouchers; his plans to review the regulations in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":448,"content":"<p>As gift cards and vouchers are offered by thousands of businesses, large and small, it is difficult to make a precise estimate of the value of the market for gift cards and vouchers. I am aware that, in a statement issued in November 2013, the Deputy put the annual value of the gift card industry at &euro;250 million, but I do not know the basis for this estimate. The figure is clearly substantial, however, given that a survey of over 1,000 consumers undertaken for the National Consumer Agency in November 2013 found that around half of consumers planned to purchase gift vouchers or cards as Christmas presents that year and that the average intended spend per consumer on these products was &euro;174.  Though there are no specific legislative provisions governing gift cards and vouchers, businesses supplying these products are subject to general consumer protection legislation. <br\/><br\/>The European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 (S.I. No. 27 of 1995) provide protections for consumers against any term in a contract concluded between a seller of goods or supplier of services and a consumer which has not been individually negotiated and which causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer. The Consumer Protection Act 2007 protects consumers from unfair, misleading or aggressive commercial practices by traders, such as false or misleading information about the terms of use or date of expiry of gift vouchers. The European Union (Consumer Information, Cancellation and Other Rights) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 484 of 2013) impose an extensive range of information obligations on traders who sell gift cards or vouchers, whether on an on-premises, off-premises or distance basis. <br\/><br\/>The Regulations also give consumers who conclude contracts for the purchase of gift cards or vouchers on an off-premises or distance basis the right to cancel the contract within fourteen days of its conclusion.

","asker":"1182","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":451,"content":"<p>The Companies Bill 2012 completed Report and Final Stages in the Seanad on 30 September 2014. &ldquo;Report Back&rdquo; to the D&aacute;il on the Seanad amendments is expected in mid-December. The Bill is expected to be enacted by the end of 2014 with commencement from the 1st June 2015.    The main changes contained in the Companies Bill, 2012 are:<\/p><p>- The private company limited by shares (LTD) will have the same legal capacity as a natural person. <\/p><p>- The LTD will be allowed to have only one director. <\/p><p>- The LTD will have a single-document constitution.   <\/p><p>- The LTD will no longer be obliged to go through the formality of holding a &ldquo;physical&rdquo; Annual General Meeting (AGM) whereby all of the members have to convene in one location at the same time once each year. The Bill allows the members to instead hold a &ldquo;written&rdquo; AGM, whereby all of the matters which must be dealt with at the AGM can be approved by written procedure.<\/p><p>- Directors' duties are codified in the Bill, thereby making the law in this area more transparent and accessible. Currently many of the legal and equitable duties of directors are set out over more the 150 years of case law.<\/p><p>- The Bill provides for a &ldquo;summary approval procedure&rdquo;, which will be applicable to a number of activities (for example, reduction of capital) which under the current law might require the company to undertake the burdensome and expensive process of securing Court approval. The new &ldquo;summary approval procedure&rdquo; incorporates safeguards in relation to directors&rsquo; liability in circumstances where the procedure is used without proper justification.   <\/p><p>- The Bill contains a qualification regime for liquidators. In general, this will require liquidators to be a member of a prescribed accountancy body, or of the Law Society, or of any other body recognised for this purpose by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), or to be approved individually by IAASA pursuant to the transition (or &ldquo;grandfathering&rdquo;) provision, based on the individual&rsquo;s experience and expertise. Liquidators will now also be required to hold appropriate professional indemnity cover. This qualification regime will also be extended to examiners under the Bill.<\/p><p>- All offences under company law have been streamlined under a new classification procedure which operates on the basis of four categories of offences, with Category 1 being the most serious. This will bring a structure and consistency to the offence provisions throughout the legislation.<\/p><p>- It will be possible to merge two Irish private companies. The procedure for this is modelled on the EU Cross-Border Merger Regulations, which are regarded as relatively straightforward to operate by the business and advisory community.<\/p><p>- Each company type (other than the private company limited by shares, which is dealt with in Parts 1 to 15) will have its own dedicated Part of the Bill. Each of these Parts will apply, disapply or vary the default provisions as set out in Parts 1 to 15, so as to tailor the application of the law for each other type of company.<\/p><p>- The company types which will each have their own dedicated Part, following this structure, are as follows &ndash; designated activity companies (Part 16), PLCs (Part 17), guarantee companies (Part 18), unlimited companies (Part 19), external companies (Part 21), unregistered companies (Part 22), and investment companies (Part 24).<\/p><p>- Part 18 extends the availability of the audit exemption to guarantee companies, on the same basis as this is available to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; trading companies (private companies limited by shares). However, any one member of a guarantee company can object to the audit exemption being availed of, and in these circumstances the company will be required to proceed with an audit.<\/p><p>- Part 20 contains provisions which will enable a company to convert from any company type (for example, a private company limited by shares) to any other company type (for example, a PLC), subject to complying with the requirements for the company type to which it wishes to convert.<\/p><p>- Part 21 contains a streamlined regime for external companies operating in Ireland. The previous &ldquo;place of business&rdquo; concept from the Companies Act 1963, which was problematic in certain respects in its operation, is not being carried forward in the Bill. All external companies will now have the single option of registering as a &ldquo;branch&rdquo; in Ireland, which is a concept under EU law (and which Ireland is accordingly obliged to provide for) and which offers greater clarity and structure.<\/p><p>- Part 23 contains the provisions that apply to companies whose shares are traded on a stock exchange, including provisions in relation to what is known as &ldquo;Markets law&rdquo;.  This includes provisions dealing with public offers of securities (including prospectus law), market abuse law, corporate governance statements for traded companies, and transparency law. These provisions are largely based on EU requirements in these respective areas.-\tPart 24 contains the provisions relevant to investment funds companies, which were previously set out predominantly in Part XIII of the Companies Act 1990. These have now been consolidated, with appropriate subsequent provisions from the 2005, 2006 and 2009 Acts in this Part. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200062#WRK01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Enterprise Centres","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200062#WRK01750"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[46327\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200062#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps he will take to approve the funding for the new business development programme for community enterprise centres as this programme is important to enable community enterprise centres to continue to make a significant impact on job creation, as they have done in the past; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The General Scheme of the Bill includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation.  In addition, two new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services will be created.<\/p><p>  The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and\/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence. <\/p><p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012 and which includes a recommendation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence to introduce such an offence.  I have met with representatives from both sides of the debate, including those working in the industry, and my Department has received numerous representations expressing views from both sides.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that it is necessary to take steps to tackle the trafficking and wider exploitation of persons through prostitution.  Unlike the existing offences relating to prostitution such as soliciting, loitering or brothel keeping, the new offences will specifically target the demand for prostitution.<\/p><p>  My Department will continue to provide help and assistance to victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation including those seeking to leave prostitution.  In 2014, the Department of Justice and Equality allocated &euro;172,000 to Ruhama, an NGO working with women in prostitution and those exiting prostitution, in order to support Ruhama's work in assisting women victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation.  Support services to suspected victims of human trafficking for sexual exploitation, including those in prostitution, are provided by the Reception and Integration Agency, the Human Trafficking Team of the HSE, the Legal Aid Board and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to accommodation; medical care and planning; psychological assistance; material assistance; legal aid and advice; accessing the labour market and vocational training, personal security; translation and interpretation services; etc.  The Women's Health Service of the HSE also provides medical and other support services to women in prostitution and exiting prostitution.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the specific question concerning the trafficking of persons for prostitution and sexual exploitation, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purposes of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 prohibits trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  Any person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for life or a lesser term, and at the discretion of the court, to a fine.   It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years and\/or a fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200065#WRN03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200065#WRN03700"},{"type":"question","counter":619,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[45781\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200065#WRN03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No 115 of 2 October 2014, the number of complaints of petrol stretching the Garda&iacute; in Mayo Divisions have received for each month from June 2014 to date in 2014; the position regarding these complaints; the number that have been investigated resulting in a person being charged or a file being forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

The cost of naturalisation is not easily comparable across jurisdictions as the range of fees, fee structures and concessions available are diverse.  Some countries charge relatively small amounts during the naturalisation process but make acquiring the required residence to apply for naturalisation very costly. Some countries charge both local and federal naturalisation fees that can bring the cost to more than twice that in the State. Naturalisation costs in the UK are higher than those in the State and significantly higher for some categories of applicant. The headline accompanying the joint statement is therefore misleading as the cost to naturalise in the State is not the highest in the world nor is it anywhere close to being the highest. It is notable that the volume of applications for a certificate of naturalisation increased by over 50% in 2011, the year that the application fee was introduced, and increased further in 2012. In relation to encouraging democratic participation, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has been pro-active in this area and a leaflet informing new citizens of their right to register and vote in all elections in the State and how to register has been included in all ceremony packs since 20 May 2013. <\/p><p>  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011 set out the prescribed fees to be paid by an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation.  An application fee of &euro;175 is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a fee is payable by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.<\/p><p>  The standard fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for a certificate of naturalisation. <\/p><p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. I might also add that following the grant of citizenship it is no longer necessary for the person concerned to register their presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau which requires the payment of a fee of &euro;300 per registration.<\/p><p>  All of the fees payable under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 are kept under ongoing review by my Department.

A significant level of activity is taking place in pursuit of this commitment. <br\/><br\/>  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration has a cross-Departmental mandate to develop, lead and co-ordinate migrant integration policy across other Government Departments, agencies and services.  The Office is currently engaged in a review of our approach to the integration of migrants with a view to the preparation of a new updated overall integration strategy in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the integration of migrants.  A Cross Departmental Group on Integration was reconstituted in March, 2014 to this end with a mandate to review the activities being undertaken by Government Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of migrants, preparing a Draft Integration Strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented, and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders.  A public consultation process was subsequently launched on 28 March 2014 as part of the review.  Over eighty submissions were received from stakeholders, a large number of whom have now met with the Cross Departmental Group on Integration.  The Cross Departmental Group has also held a number of thematic meetings focussing on key policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including education, access to public services and social inclusion, and the promotion of intercultural awareness and combatting racism.  Work on the development of the updated integration strategy is ongoing and will continue into 2015 when a draft strategy will be published and observations invited from key stakeholders before finalisation.  <br\/><br\/>In light of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, 90 persons displaced by the Syrian conflict and who had taken refuge in the Lebanon and Jordan were selected for admission to Ireland under a UNHCR resettlement programme by the resettlement team of the Office.  Seventy eight of the refugees have arrived to date and have been resettled.  This figure includes three serious medical cases (including two children) and their families, who are receiving appropriate medical treatment.  A further twelve refugees will arrive in December. In 2015, 100 refugees will be admitted, the majority from Syria. The resettlement team also continue to work with programme refugees admitted under previous years programmes.<br\/><br\/>The Office also continues to monitor the prevalence of racist incidents and publishes information in this regard on its website.  Other ongoing work is the provision of integration related material via the Office website and circulation lists, dealing with international reporting obligations and representation at integration related national and international fora.  The Office provides funding for the promotion of integration to some local authorities and national sports and other organisations.  It also administers EU funding for this purpose.

I met with the group in question on 5th November last and am aware of their concerns.<\/p><p>  I am aware of the sustainability issues faced by early years services and, over the coming period, I will be examining the options for future childcare investment.  <\/p><p>  Annual funding in the region of &euro;260 million is provided to the childcare sector to support a number of childcare programmes that are implemented by this Department. These programmes include the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and a number of labour activation initiatives under the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes.  These programmes, in particular the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, provide a guaranteed source of income to participating services and, given that many parents would otherwise not be able to avail of pre-school care and education for their children, the funding has ensured that many childcare services, both commercial and community, have the resources to continue to operate.  <\/p><p>  Despite the budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years the Government has maintained the funding necessary to support these childcare programmes and has introduced new initiatives to meet the changing circumstances, particularly in regard to the improved employment opportunities in the economy.  As additional funding becomes available, I would hope that the capitation rates for all programmes could be increased to provide further support. <\/p><p>  I acknowledge that over previous years there have been delays in payments made to service providers, which may have resulted in further financial pressures at given times. This has been due to the fact that the programmes have undergone considerable changes to meet the changing childcare needs.  New programmes to support training and labour market activation measures have been introduced and, because these programmes have been administered separately and manually on separate databases, there have been issues in relation to duplication of effort and data exchange.  <\/p><p>  In recognition of these issues my Department and Pobal are in the process of introducing a new management platform for the early years programmes &ndash; the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP).  This new online system will streamline the administrative processes across childcare funding programmes.  It is envisaged that PIP will reduce paper-based exchanges of information between parties by the provision of online forms for data entry and integrated document management capabilities. This in turn will shorten the lead in time for key programme milestones, for example, the contracting period, initial payments, funding approval and subsequent payments. <\/p><p>  The introduction of new ICT infrastructure tends to result in minor technical issues emerging and PIP, a complex system, has been no exception, resulting in service providers experiencing delays in registering children on the system. Advance payments were made to service providers for both the ECCE and CCS programmes. <\/p><p>  On the 15th of October this year, while over 30,000 children had already been registered on the system for the ECCE programme, my Department took the decision to issue a further advance payment to service providers to allow for those service providers who had experienced delays or difficulties in completing their registrations. While acknowledging the inconvenience for service providers not receiving accurate balancing payments as early as usual, the decision was taken to ensure that all service providers received sufficient advance funding to honour any financial commitments, rather than to delay all payments until the PIP technical issues were resolved.  Providers were entitled to apply for an additional advance payment if they had significantly more children registered on the programme than last year.  <\/p><p>  ECCE balancing payments covering the period up to 23rd January 2015 are being made this week.  These payments are based on the actual numbers of children registered and approved for participation in the programme.<\/p><p>  The PIP technical issues also affected payments under the Training and Employment Childcare programmes.  These issues have also been resolved and there should be no delays in payments in the future. <\/p><p>  CCS Registrations on the PIP system are being launched this week. CCS service providers have also received a further preliminary payment, covering the period up to the end of January 2015, while CCS eligibility criteria is validated.<\/p><p>  The new ICT system is expected to further streamline the payment process for all of the childcare support programmes implemented by this Department. I can assure the Deputy that both my Department and Pobal are working to address issues as PIP develops, and I am confident that once the system is fully operational it will prove to be extremely beneficial and efficient and will significantly improve the situation for service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200068#WRQ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Remit","counter":763,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200069#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":764,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[45838\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200069#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on the recent court proceedings in which an action initiated by Tusla against a child care facility was dismissed on the basis that the agency had no authority to take the case; the reason the action was not initiated until after 1 January 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

To help address the issue, funding of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support the implementation of a number of targeted childcare support programmes that assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.  More than 100,000 children benefit from these programmes each year.<\/p><p>  The question of tax allowances for working parents who incur childcare costs was considered prior to the introduction of the targeted childcare supports which are now in place.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of tax relief for childcare.  This approach would not benefit parents working in the home and could, therefore, be seen by some as discriminatory.  Tax reliefs would favour the higher-paid, and those on the minimum wage or in part-time work would not be in a position to benefit to the same extent.  Many parents use childminders or relatives to meet their childcare requirements and may not be in a position to obtain receipts, making it impossible for them to establish their entitlement to tax relief.  There is also a view that the introduction of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents.<\/p><p>  I consider that direct investment in childcare provision would be a fairer way of supporting parents who require childcare support.

In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The implementation of the actions contained in the Early Years Quality Agenda, which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.<br\/><br\/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,<\/i>the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.

Government has agreed that the Scheme will also include payments for the small number of women who have had a pubiotomy. The Scheme is designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and aims to minimise the stress for the women concerned. Many are elderly and may not want to experience the delay, publicity and financial risks that sometimes come with a court case.  I met the three support groups representing the women last September and their views have helped to shape the Scheme. The Scheme is supported by two of the three groups.  <br\/><br\/>Judge Maureen Harding Clark, retired High Court Judge has been appointed as independent Assessor to the Scheme. Judge Clark, from her previous work on the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme, brings valuable experience to the role of determining the appropriate level of award for each individual. <br\/><br\/>The Symphysiotomy Scheme is open to women who are still living and who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in the State between the years 1940 and 1990. Awards of &euro;50,000, &euro;100,000 and &euro;150,000 will be offered. Details of the Terms of the Scheme and how to access application forms have been widely advertised.<br\/><br\/>Awards will be exempt from tax and legislation is being put in place as a matter of urgency to ensure they are also exempt from being taken into consideration for means tested welfare schemes and for the Nursing Home Support Scheme. <br\/><br\/>It is not a requirement for a woman to retain a Solicitor to make an application.  However, the Scheme makes provision for applicants to have legal and other advice available to them in preparing to submit an application if they wish.<br\/><br\/>Applications must be made within 20 working days of the Commencement Date, which was 10 November, 2014.  The Closing Date for receipt of applications is therefore Friday 5 December 2014.  In exceptional circumstances, Judge Clark has discretion to extend the time for receipt of applications by an additional 20 working days, that is, to Wednesday, 14 January 2015.  It is important to note that in the event of a delay arising in the compilation of a woman's supporting documentation due to difficulty in obtaining medical records, the application should be submitted within the time period set out in the Scheme with a written explanation of the reasons for the absence of the documentation. The details of this provision are set out in the terms and conditions of the Scheme, which are available on the Scheme&rsquo;s website. <br\/><br\/>Judge Clark reported that by last Friday, 28 November more than 140 women had applied for awards under the Scheme and to date conditional offers have been made totalling &euro;1,450,000.  There are 4 working days left to apply, including today and I would urge every eligible woman or her representative to submit her application within the appointed timeframe.<b><\/b>My Department will be making payments in the case of 7 women shortly and others should have payments before Christmas. <br\/><br\/>The Scheme is voluntary and I would like to emphasise that women will not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. Women may opt out of the Scheme at any stage in the process, up to the time of accepting their award.  It is only on accepting the offer of an award that a woman must agree to discontinue her legal proceedings against any party arising out of a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy.<br\/><br\/>Government hopes the implementation of this Scheme will help to bring closure on this issue for the women concerned and their families. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200070#WRS02300","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Drugs Payment Scheme Coverage","counter":846,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200070#WRS02350"},{"type":"question","counter":847,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[45990\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200070#WRS02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding access to treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Laois; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":848,"content":"<p>Decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer, are not political or ministerial decisions.

This level of fluoride is deemed optimal for protecting the oral health of all age groups. European Council Directive 98\/83 allows for a maximum permitted concentration of fluoride in drinking water up to 1.5mg\/litre (or parts per million), almost twice the maximum level permitted in Ireland.  In 2011 a review by the European Union Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risk (SCHER) concluded that there are no known negative health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU.  The balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, i.e. the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the optimal recommended level for the prevention of dental caries, does not cause any ill effects and protects the oral health of the population.<\/p><p>  A number of studies which claim an effect on children's IQ at very high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, were assessed by the Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health in 2011.  They were found to be of no relevance to Ireland, given our regulated fluoridation levels.<\/p><p>  The most recent study on this topic reviewed by the Expert Body was the paper on 'Community Water Fluoridation and Intelligence: Prospective Study in New Zealand (Broadbent et al 2014).  Broadbent et al state that 'findings do not support the assertion that fluoride exposure in the context of CWF (Community Water Fluoridation) can affect neurologic development or IQ&quot;.  The study suggests that study members who lived in areas with CWF before age 5 years had slightly higher IQ's (on average) in adulthood than those who had not, although the difference was not statistically significant.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.  As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population is being conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department.  This review is due to be completed by the end of  this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200071#WRT00300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Funding","counter":868,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200071#WRT00350"},{"type":"question","counter":869,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[46058\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200071#WRT00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding funding for a men's group in north Dublin (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":870,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

The vetting arrangements were updated in 2010 and are set out in Department Circular 0063\/2010.<br\/><br\/>The vetting arrangements will operate on a statutory basis when the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 is commenced.  Some amendments are being made to this Act by the Minister for Justice and Equality before it is commenced. <br\/><br\/>The number of teachers vetted under the non-statutory arrangements continues to steadily increase.  There are 90,121 teachers on the Teaching Council register and 53,753 of them have been vetted. This represents about 60% of the teachers on the register.  A breakdown of these teachers by sector is attached for the Deputy's information.<br\/><br\/>The remaining balance of 36,368 that are not vetted are typically permanent teachers who have been in the same school since prior to 2006. Over the years the lack of capacity in the Garda Central Vetting Unit has been an impediment to getting all these existing teachers vetted. <br\/><br\/>The Garda Central Vetting Unit indicated to the Department, at a meeting in July 2014, that it now has capacity to vet these remaining teachers that were never vetted.<br\/><br\/>However, if this is done now under the current non-statutory vetting arrangements it would be confined to a check for criminal offences. <br\/><br\/>The forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements include a check for relevant &quot;soft information&quot; which is an important new aspect of the vetting arrangements. &quot;Soft information&quot; is referred to as &quot;specified information&quot; in the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012 and is information other than criminal convictions held by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where such information leads to a bona-fide belief that a person poses a threat to children or vulnerable persons.<br\/><br\/>Given that the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements will include a check for both criminal offences and also any relevant &quot;soft information&quot; the Department considers that at this stage it is better from a child protection perspective to wait for the vetting of these teachers to be done under the forthcoming statutory vetting arrangements.  This will also dovetail with the amendments that are being made to the Teaching Council Act which include: (a) Linking compliance with the vetting arrangements with renewal of registration; (b) Strengthening the Fitness to Teach provisions so as to provide an appropriate mechanism for assessing a teacher's fitness to remain on the register if a vetting disclosure received in respect of a teacher indicates any potential risk of harm to a child.  Removal of a teacher from the Teaching Council register is the best way of achieving child protection across all schools.<br\/><br\/>It is intended that all registered teachers will be vetted under the statutory vetting arrangements as soon as possible after the legislation is commenced.As of 27\/11\/2014 there were 90,121 teachers on the Register. 53,753 have been vetted. <br\/><br\/>The breakdown by sector is as follows:<table><tr><th>Registration Regulation<\/th><th>No. Registered Teachers<\/th><th>No. Teachers Vetted<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Primary <\/td><td>42687<\/td><td>26585<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Montessori and Other Categories<\/td><td>1277<\/td><td>646<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Post-primary<\/td><td>42069<\/td><td>23657<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Further Education<\/td><td>6339<\/td><td>5238<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sector unknown as teacher has not informed the Teaching Council of their qualification details or they are registered under Section 31(2) &amp;amp; (3).<\/td><td>1480<\/td><td>152<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>93852**<\/td><td>56278**<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/>** Please note that the numbers in the table are higher than the overall total on the register as there are a number of teachers registered in two or more sectors<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200073#WRV04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":1012,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200073#WRV04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1013,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[45805\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200073#WRV04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update on a building project in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1087","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1014,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers submitted an application for additional accommodation comprising a resource room and staff accommodation.

The Work Placement Programme also provides opportunities for graduates to gain work experience in employment in public, private and voluntary sectors.<\/p><p>  The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority, subject to procedures agreed under Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 (as amended by the Education (Amendment) Act 2012). The Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure document 2011 sets out the procedures for appointment of teachers and special needs assistants at primary level.<\/p><p>  Circular 31\/2011 details a cascade of measures for recruitment of teachers, prioritising unemployed registered teachers over retired registered teachers and registered teachers over unregistered persons.<\/p><p>  Each principal must report to his or her board of management on a regular basis on the fact that a list of unemployed registered teachers is being maintained, and the circumstances in which he or she has had to engage a registered teacher in receipt of a pension under a public service pension scheme or an unregistered person.<\/p><p>  The allocation of additional funding for the employment of teachers due to the increase in numbers of pupils in the 2015 Budget will assist in creating additional positions which will further assist newly qualified teachers to obtain positions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200074#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Applications","counter":1034,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200074#WRW01350"},{"type":"question","counter":1035,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[46125\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200074#WRW01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a decision will be made on student grant applications in respect of persons (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1036,"content":"<p>As part of a comprehensive customer service and communications strategy provided by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), to ensure that all necessary avenues are open to applicants to receive the information they need, a dedicated email and phone line service is provided by SUSI for Oireachtas members.

Our public water infrastructure is deficient and inadequate as a consequence of decades of under-investment and the lack of a truly, national approach that could maximise the impact of investment.<\/p><p>  An Independent Assessment published in 2012 reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of the delivery of water services through 34 local authorities, and concluded that there was a fragmentation of leadership and co-ordination, difficulty in attaining economies of scale, difficulty in delivering projects of national importance and an aging and poor quality network. The report concluded that the best way of ensuring increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and capital investment and accessing new finances for the water sector, was to establish Irish Water as a public utility.  This was implemented through the Water Services Act 2013, which provided for the establishment of Irish Water, and the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, which provided for the transfer of responsibility for water services provision from the local authorities to Irish Water. The transfer of responsibility took effect on 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>  In advance of the introduction of water charges, Irish Water sent application packs to approximately 2 million households. The objective of the application process was to enable customers to confirm their details for billing and relevant PPS numbers were requested in order for customers to claim the allowances that they were eligible for.<\/p><p>  On 19 November 2014, the Government decided on the introduction of a number of measures in relation to a revised approach to water charges. This was done to provide clarity and certainty and ensure that water charges are affordable for customers. As the new arrangements are based on self-declaration and appropriate audit, PPS numbers will no longer be required by Irish Water. In compliance with the requirements of the Data Protection Acts, Irish Water will delete PPS data already collected during the customer registration process to protect customers&rsquo; data. Irish Water has developed a protocol in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to address this data deletion exercise.<\/p><p>  A minimum charge of &euro;125 per year will apply for dwellings that are not permanently occupied which are using both water supply and waste water services. The minimum charge for dwellings connected to a single service will be &euro;62.50 per year. This applies to metered and unmetered dwellings. Such dwellings with meters installed will pay &euro;3.70 per 1,000 litres for usage above the equivalent usage for the minimum charge. A cap of &euro;260 per annum for such dwellings will apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Charges Administration","counter":1252,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1253,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[46032\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to set out the position regarding the liability for water charges in a landlord-tenant scenario; the implications in the event that the tenant does not pay the water charges; if the landlord has a right to establish whether or the tenant has paid the water charges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1254,"qnumday":548,"qnumall":"[46234\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to set out the position in the event of a landlord having to deduct water charges from a tenant&rsquo;s deposit if a tenant refuses to or cannot pay the water charge along with deducting money due to damage of the property, and if both deductions exceed the total deposit initially provided the way the landlord will recoup all that is owed.","asker":"1180","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1255,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 530 and 548 together.<br\/><br\/>I refer to my reply to Question No. 108 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper which sets out the position on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seniors Alert Scheme","counter":1256,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1257,"qnumday":531,"qnumall":"[46047\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to outline his proposed changes to the seniors alert scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1258,"qnumday":532,"qnumall":"[46048\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to outline the discussions he has had with Pobal and the companies current supplying the seniors alert scheme with regard to proposed changes to the system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1259,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[46049\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he has conducted a cost benefit analysis of the proposed changes to the seniors alert scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1260,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 531 to 533, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  My Department manages the Seniors Alert Scheme which encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities by providing grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms to enable older persons, of limited means, to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.

My Department undertook to consider new approaches to the Seniors Alert Scheme in 2014 and from this it was recommended that the scheme be managed by Pobal with effect from 1 January 2015, given that organisation&rsquo;s significant experience delivering programmes on behalf of Government.<\/p><p>  Pobal will provide management and administrative services for the Seniors Alert Scheme.

The report also identified significant non-compliance among those with responsibilities under the current Waste Tyre Regulations.  To address these significant shortcomings, my Department has been working, in full consultation with all parts of the tyre industry, to assist it in putting in place a system of producer responsibility, in line with those that apply to other sectors, to provide for the collection, sorting and management of the waste they produce in an environmentally sound manner. This is in line with the &ldquo;polluter pays principle&rdquo; which is a firmly established feature of both domestic waste policy and legislation.  This will require an overhaul of existing structures, but I believe that this can be achieved without distorting the tyres market in Ireland, without encouraging customers to buy tyres outside of the jurisdiction and without widespread job losses. Moreover, I believe that such a scheme could be provided for without introducing any new costs, but rather by effectively formalising the existing charge that is already applied to almost all tyre purchases.<\/p><p>  Arising from the work of the Tyres Working Group, which includes representatives from across the waste and tyres industries, my Department has now received proposals for the future management of waste tyres from the Independent Tyre Wholesalers and Retailers Association (ITWRA) and the Irish Tyre Industry Association (ITIA). While it would have been my preference for all sides within the industry to come together in support of a single proposal, the separate proposals are being considered by my Department. I expect to receive recommendations arising from this consideration in the near future and, once I have made my decision, I will engage once more with all sides of the tyre industry to collaborate in putting in place the detailed legislative underpinning for the operation and enforcement of the new system. Following these developments, my Department will aim to have the new model for waste compliance in the tyre sector operational by mid-2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Meters Installation","counter":1264,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":1265,"qnumday":535,"qnumall":"[46074\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"to indicate the name of the manufacturer of the water meters that are currently being rolled out across the country; if he will indicate the location where the meters were produced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1266,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels including responsibility for the delivery of the domestic metering programme.

In broad terms, since 1 July 2013, manufacturers are required, when placing a construction product on the market, to make a Declaration of Performance (DoP) and to affix the CE mark when a product covered by a harmonised European standard, or a European Technical Assessment (ETA), is placed on the market.  The DoP serves to deliver the information about the essential characteristics of the product that a manufacturer wants to make available to the market. The manufacturer, by drawing up a DoP, assumes responsibility for the conformity of the construction product with the declared performances.<\/p><p>  Harmonised European standards provide the methods and the criteria for assessing the performance of construction products in relation to their essential characteristics. In order to ensure that the DoPs for specific products are accurate and reliable, the performance of the construction products shall be assessed and their production in the factory shall be controlled to ensure that the products will continue to have the same performances. This is achieved by applying a system of Assessment and Verification of Constancy of Performance (AVCP) for each family of construction products.<\/p><p>  The harmonised European standard includes the technical data necessary for the implementation of the AVCP system including third party oversight (determined as proportionate to the level of risk involved) which the manufacturer is required to comply with. In addition, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has also produced additional guidance to some harmonised European standards in the form of National Annexes or Standard Recommendations which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The EN 771 series of standards cover the specification for masonry units.  I.S. EN 771-3: 2011 Specification for masonry units - Part 3: Aggregate concrete masonry units (Dense and lightweight aggregates) is the relevant harmonised European standard for concrete blocks.  This standard specifies the characteristics and performance requirements of aggregate concrete masonry units made from dense and lightweight aggregates for which the main intended uses are common, facing or exposed masonry in load bearing or non-load bearing building and civil engineering applications.<\/p><p>  Specific guidance on the minimum acceptable performances for concrete blocks for use in Ireland to supplement the harmonised European standard is included in the NSAI Standard Recommendation, S.R. 325:2013+A1:2014 Recommendations for the use of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6. S.R. 325 provides guidance on strength, moisture movement, reaction to fire etc. and crucially requires the aggregates for use in dense concrete blocks to comply with I.S. EN 12620. This is important given that the NSAI has also produced a Standard Recommendation entitled S.R. 16 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002 - Aggregates for concrete which includes an example specification in its Annex A covering grading, strength, durability, chemical composition etc. applicable to most general uses of aggregates in concrete in Ireland.<\/p><p>  S.R. 325 also provides guidance on the choice of masonry units and mortar classes most appropriate for particular situations as regards durability for finished work.  To this end, S.R. 325 recommends that Category 1 masonry units (units with a declared compressive strength with a probability of failure to reach it not exceeding 5%) be used, requiring oversight by a third party known as a notified body for the purposes of performing an initial inspection of the factory and of the factory production control and for undertaking continuous surveillance, assessment and approval of the factory production control.<\/p><p>  Notified bodies are the only recognised third party bodies that can carry out the conformity assessments laid down in the harmonised European standards or the European Technical Assessments. A list of all officially designated notified bodies under the Construction Products Regulation is available on the European Union&rsquo;s New Approach Notified and Designated Organisations (NANDO) Information System.<\/p><p>  Responsibility for demonstrating a construction product&rsquo;s compliance with the requirements of the Construction Products Regulation and the applicable harmonised European standard rests with the manufacturer although obligations are also imposed on both the importers an d distributors of such products.<\/p><p>  Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013, building control authorities have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the remit of Construction Products Regulation. Under these Regulations, market surveillance authorities have significant powers to deal with situations where constructions products are placed on the market which do not comply with the requirements set out in the Construction Products Regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Assistance Payments Eligibility","counter":1283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1284,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[46172\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB02900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 156 of 25 November 2014 his plans to address the gaps in the new housing assistance payment scheme whereby a person is not entitled to receive a payment until a housing need assessment has been completed (details supplied); the options available to such persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1285,"content":"<p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy 2020, which I launched last week. HAP is designed to bring together all the social housing supports provided by the State, with local authorities being responsible for all households with an established housing need, including households in receipt of rent supplement for a lengthy period. Cork County Council is one of 7 housing authorities currently operating HAP on a pilot basis.  A household presenting as homeless to a housing authority is not required to undergo a social housing assessment in order to be placed in temporary accommodation which the Council itself arranges or which is operated by a voluntary service provider. However, in order to qualify for HAP, households must be determined by a housing authority to be qualified for social housing support following a social housing assessment. The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 84 of 2011) provide that applicants for social housing support must complete the prescribed application form and provide to the housing authority any additional information sought by the authority for the purpose of verifying information relating to the application. Under the Regulations, housing authorities are expected to deal with applications within 12 weeks of receiving a completed application form or additional information but, in exceptional circumstances, may take up 14 weeks more to process an application. These periods will be reviewed in the light of experience as part of the overall review of social housing assessment and allocation policies announced in the Social Housing Strategy.<\/p><p>  Under the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, a household may qualify for social housing support if it has a mortgage that is deemed to be unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process and meets the other conditions for support. Qualification under this criterion is not dependent on the making of a possession order and my Department has advised housing authorities that, upon receipt of written confirmation from the lender that a household&rsquo;s mortgage has been deemed unsustainable, an authority may determine that the household has a housing need, even though a household member may, at that time, continue to be the legal owner of the accommodation concerned.<\/p><p>  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 includes an important transitional provision relating to the general principle that housing authorities are not required to provide social housing support for households that own alternative accommodation that could meet their housing need. The new provision relates to households that are qualified for social housing support other than in relation to the issue of whether a household member owns suitable alternative accommodation. An example of this is where a household has left the family home and ownership of that accommodation has not been resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement.  Housing authorities may now support such households under HAP or the Rental Accommodation Scheme until the issue of whether the household owns suitable alternative accommodation is clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200079#WRBB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":1287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200080#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1288,"qnumday":543,"qnumall":"[46190\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200080#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 150 of 20 November 2014, the position regarding correspondence received by him from Sligo County Council (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1083","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1289,"content":"<p>I regret that the reply to Question No. 150 of 20 November 2014 contained incorrect information; an administrative error resulted in the correspondence from Sligo County Council being filed erroneously.

The primary purpose of the Scheme was to assist in the unwinding of loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme. As such the relevant valuation for the purpose of the scheme is the value of the loans involved and, in that regard, applications to the value of some &euro;163 million in loans were accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme.<br\/><br\/>The figure of &euro;163 m includes &euro;111 m in respect of loans which were, under the first phase of the scheme, fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the Scheme. There are no interest payments due on these loans. The remaining &euro;52 m accepted into the Scheme under its second phase is in the form of annuity loans, for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency. Local authorities may recoup the capital and interest payments from my Department on condition that related LAGS lands have transferred to the Housing Agency. To date, nine of the 26 sites accepted following the introduction of the second iteration of the Scheme have transferred to the Agency.

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality. The EPA has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants based on data obtained from the 29 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.  The EPA also publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive. The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2013 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, which is available on the EPA website at , was published in October 2014 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2013, compared to the CAFE Directive standards as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health.<br\/><br\/>Downward trends have been identified for many pollutants and Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality but exceeds WHO air quality guidelines for particulate matter in some areas. Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted. As a result, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns are similar or higher than those in cities, where smoky coal is banned. To help protect our good air quality the Irish consumer must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that choice can have on air quality in their locality and on human health.<br\/><br\/>Nitrogen dioxide levels (NO<sub>2<\/sub>) levels showed a slight increasing trend in the years 2008 \u2010 2010.

However, I am also advised of the need to exercise extreme caution in relation to this raw data as these movements would, include movement of debris and other material, and a variety of fish species. The ability to disaggregate salmon movements within the overall metric will require the completion of the scientific programme and subsequent installation of a video verification array.<br\/><br\/>I understand that it is not appropriate, at this stage to draw reliable conclusions as regards salmon movements from the counter at present. Once the substantiated estimate of partial count is established in the required research programme, a video verification process will be implemented. However, the fish counter currently provides important information, from a protection perspective, on run timing and when fish enter the system. <br\/><br\/>As the counter is only active since the end of last year and requires at least three years of data for inclusion in the Independent Standing Scientific Committee for Salmon advice process, the current method of assessing the status of the river is through Catchment Wide Electrofishing (CWEF) surveys. <br\/><br\/>The data used currently by the Standing Scientific Committee is the CWEF results for the Fergus River which is returning an average of 7.45 fry, well below the required Scientific Committee&rsquo;s threshold of 17 salmon fry per catchment average to consider facilitating a catch and release fishery. <br\/><br\/>The following represents the CWEF surveys carried out:<br\/><br\/><b>Catchment Wide Electrofishing Surveys<\/b><br\/><br\/><br\/><br\/><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Average Fry per 5 minute fish<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>5.89<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>6.84<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>4.10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>12.96<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200081#WRDD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"997"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Transmission Network","counter":1368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200082#WREE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1369,"qnumday":575,"qnumall":"[46288\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200082#WREE00200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the independent expert panel considering EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid West and Grid Link projects current brief; their work to date; the appointment of external advisors; the proposed completion date; if the panel's remit will be expanded to cover the need for Grid 25; if he will examine the relationship between Grid 25 and interconnection with Europe and ensure joined-up thinking is applied; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1184","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1370,"content":"<p>The Independent Expert Panel, established in January to examine the Grid West and Grid Link projects, has met on several occasions since then to consider and approve the terms of reference for comprehensive, route-specific studies and reports of fully undergrounded and overhead options for each of the Grid West and Grid Link projects.

More information is available on EirGrid&rsquo;s website at the following address:<br\/><br\/>The ESRI and ESB submissions were two of over 1,240 responses received to the public consultation on the Energy Policy Green Paper. Insofar as the ESB submission is concerned, it is worth noting that ESB has welcomed the continuing review of EirGrid&rsquo;s Grid25 Strategy and its ongoing reflection on future grid investment priorities. Both EirGrid and ESB agree that a medium to long-term perspective is necessary in relation to building grid infrastructure, and that Grid25 is required to both facilitate future electricity demand and support balanced regional development. Both companies also acknowledge the need for the rollout of electricity networks to address citizen and community concerns, and to accommodate evolving European energy policy, including in relation to renewable energy. ESB fully supports the EU 2020 target of 16% renewable energy, which entails having 40% of electricity generated from renewable sources. It is important to note that my Department, ESB and EirGrid are all in agreement on the appropriateness and prudence of the 40% target, which is based on solid scientific and engineering evidence.<br\/><br\/>The question of Proximity Payments is also a matter for EirGrid.

In accordance with the Government Decision of 12 April 2011, my predecessor commenced a process of seeking, on the Department&rsquo;s website, expressions of Interest from persons wishing to be considered for appointment to vacancies on State Boards under the aegis of this Department. This information has been used to inform decisions for such appointments, but I would stress that such invitations are designed to extend the range of suitable persons from which a Minister might make appointments, not to constrain it. While appointments are made by the relevant Minister, I would add that appointments to Boards also include nominations, provided for by statute, by Committees of the Oireachtas, worker directors and ex-officio positions. While the precise structure varies from body to body, in total this can amount to a significant proportion of the Board in certain instances.All appointments are made in light of the applicable legislative requirements, objectives of the organisation and on the basis of appointees having the necessary competencies, expertise and experience to contribute effectively to the work of the particular boards.<br\/><br\/>Following its meeting of 30 September, the Government announced a revised model for ministerial appointments to State boards. From November 1 all appointments to State boards must be advertised openly on the State Boards portal, www.stateboards.ie, which is operated by the Public Appointments Service and at its meeting of 25 November 2014, the Government agreed the publication of guidelines entitled &ldquo;.

If additional funds are available, which is not certain, there will be many competing projects from all transport modes in all regions.\u00a0 Any additional funds will be prioritised for projects for which there is a clear need, which are affordable, have a sound business case and add value to existing infrastructure.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>  Subject to funding availability, some projects which are part of the overall DART Underground Programme, and which have capacity benefits in and of themselves, may proceed over the next number of years.

The IFB is the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry, including the animation sector. <br\/><br\/>Irish animation is a dynamic, growing and highly international sector that is making a significant impact on the global animation scene.  Irish media and entertainment companies are becoming more export focused, providing award-winning content that is bought by companies such as Disney, Nickelodeon and the BBC and viewed by millions in over 130 territories worldwide.  It is estimated that over 1,000 persons are employed as technical and creative staff in animation studios in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Government remains focused on the development of this sector, with the following supports in place: the recently enhanced 32% Section 481 film tax incentive, which is available for film and television, is in place until 2020; investment in Irish talent and Irish animated film and television content is made through development and production loans from the IFB; strategic company development support is available through Enterprise Ireland (EI); international promotional support is available from the IFB and EI for the industry at major festivals and international markets; investment in training is available from Screen Training Ireland (STI), the training arm of the IFB, as well as through Animation Skillsnet, which is funded from the National Training Fund through the Department of Education and Skills; and support for TV animation projects with an Irish broadcaster is available from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. <br\/><br\/>The development and promotion of Irish animated content is a priority for the IFB.  To this end, the IFB provides a significant level of development funding for home-grown Irish content, which aims to off-set some of the risk in the development of Irish animated content and IP.  Since 2009, the IFB has invested almost &euro;1.6 million in the development of Irish animated film and TV projects, which is directly aimed at supporting the growth of the animation sector.<br\/><br\/>The IFB is the largest funder for animation production activity in the country.  Since 2006, the agency has provided almost &euro;11 million in funding for Irish content to the sector.  The level of IFB support for the animation sector did not reduce following the economic downturn, despite the overall reduction in IFB funding since 2008. <br\/><br\/>The IFB, through STI, provides training across all sectors of the industry and is particularly active in the area of digital production, which includes animation.  Over the past number of years, STI has trained almost 1,500 professionals at all levels in the animation industry, These ranged from graduates entering the industry to animation CEOs, including animation directors, production managers, producers, storyboard artists and animators, together with a diversity of digital artists specialising in a range of disciplines in animation, including rigging, lighting, texturing, and shading.  <br\/><br\/>STI and the IFB have for the past two years supported <i>The Bridge Programme<\/i>, an initiative of Animation Skillnet and the Dublin Business Innovation Centre, which pairs teams of animation graduates with local studios on active projects, in order to expose them to professional working practices in a studio environment.  Many of these graduates have subsequently found employment in animation studios.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200084#WRGG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme Expenditure","counter":1488,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200084#WRGG01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1489,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[45820\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014120200084#WRGG01900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the funding and grant assistance that may be available for the restoration, renovation and refurbishment of churches and cathedrals; the qualifying criteria and application process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
