I assume it will be within the next couple of weeks.  I raise it because all Members of the House, including Government Members, should be aware that it offers a real opportunity to the Government to redress the total unfairness pertaining to the Aer Lingus and airport pensions.  Many Members will have received extensive e-mails from normal families around the country, whose promised pensions the Government proposes to cut by up to 60%.  There may be an unintended consequence in this regard and in advance of publication of the social welfare Bill, I urge Government Members in particular to impress upon the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, that this offers an opportunity to address this imbalance, particularly for the deferred members of those schemes, who face cuts of up to 60%.  I am aware that some Labour Party Senators in particular have been deeply involved in the background in this regard but it will be time for people to put their money where their mouths are during the passage of the social welfare Bill.  More importantly, it will be the time to save many families from extensive drastic cuts to their pensions.  I ask Members to read in detail what has been sent to them by normal families and by people who are due to retire in the next couple of years regarding the cuts that will be brought upon them by the Government should this issue not be rectified in the social welfare Bill.<\/p><p>Second, I note today is European restart a heart day and I listened to a radio interview on Newstalk this morning with a young man from Swords named Darragh Lawlor, who I know quite well.  He carried out cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, on an individual on Main Street in Swords, who happened to be his uncle although he did not realise this was the case.  He kept that man alive and that individual has now recovered fully.  A total of 70% of cardiac arrests happen in the home and the purpose of  European restart a heart day is to try to encourage people to upskill in the area of CPR.  While I am aware that the Minister for Health is due to come into the House on 4 November, there will be a lot to go through and I believe a separate debate in the House on a national policy on defibrillation and defibrillators is merited.  Certain councils and certain areas of the country are good at it but I refer to a national policy on, as opposed to a roll-out of defibrillators.  I also suggest to the Leas-Chathaoirleach that schools are an ideal place for young adults to learn these skills, particularly around transition year.  Does the Department of Education and Skills have a policy whereby there can be a roll-out through the schools, thus ensuring that all young adults are trained in CPR techniques?  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate  specifically on this issue in the next few weeks.  It would be important and is a job that Members could do here to inform Government policy with regard to the roll-out of defibrillators and the provision of training to people in life-saving CPR.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600003#B00500","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1413451800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Darragh O'Brien for a good idea on CPR on this day.

Members are in the presence of a group of young people this morning and really, this is about bringing leadership and encouraging young people to take their place in the world and to allow their voices to be heard in respect of leadership.

While I accept that it has been disbanded, I am concerned about its legacy.  If the Minister finds it difficult to attend the House because of the nature of the issues that led to the unit's disbanding, he may need to put in place an investigation into its legacy.  The unit operated for many years, behaved like a private hit squad and effectively ruined the lives and reputations of a number of farmers.  It is not enough just to disband the unit; we must examine its legacy and what it did.  The confidence that the Department's new investigations division needs will not exist if the old system has not been thoroughly interrogated in a fashion that gives results and shows that there is nothing to hide.

We are getting close to that situation with Irish Water.  There are reports of the meetings yesterday of the Government parliamentary parties where the issue was raised. There is surplus staff, a bonus culture, weak regulation by a regulator that pays its own staff bonuses, the inability to communicate, the \"take it or leave it\" attitude and the off-balance sheet vehicle that is allegedly meant to promote investment.  We need to debate what is turning out to be a poll tax.  The consumption of water does not change as people's incomes increase.  We used to pay for water through general taxation, even though the first piece of propaganda put out was that we did not.  The losses were mistakenly blamed on the consumer rather than the supplier.  We must recover from a very bad start in the operation of Irish Water.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate early next week in which these alternatives are considered?<\/p><p>I note the opinions of Fr. Peter McVerry on the housing crisis.  Like me, he welcomed what the Government did on Tuesday, but this is a multifaceted problem.  In the buy-to-let sector, tenants need protection when their landlords are in trouble.  In communications with Senators, the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, showed an interest in this matter.  Can we get a lease and a tribunal on rents for such people?  The rental sector is here to stay.  If we can index rents to some measure of consumer prices, tenants will be protected in their leases.  The amount they pay should not be decided in a bubble economy by the vulture capitalists who are taking over buy-to-let properties.  The landlords went broke, not the tenants.<\/p><p>We need to tackle brownfield sites in city centres.  There is so much dereliction between Heuston Station and Christ Church Cathedral.  Are all of those landlords waiting for a bonus when Dublin City Council comes calling with compulsory purchase orders?  Can we impose obligations on them to maintain their properties?  Brownfield sites have something to contribute.  NAMA offered empty houses to some local authorities.  As the Leader will recall, there was a low rate of acceptance.  The houses might be in the wrong places, but we cannot all live in Killiney and Dalkey.  If houses are available and we have a homelessness problem, the Minister should attend the Seanad to debate the matter in the widest possible context within the parameters set out in Fr. McVerry's article, including the question of the capital gains tax paid by people who flip trophy homes and take out large property supplements in our newspapers, distorting the way we view the housing issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600004#C00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1413452400,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I am glad that Senator Darragh O'Brien has been restored to his proper place and I welcome him back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600004#C00300","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1413452400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600004#C00400","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1413452400,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600004#C00500","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1413452400,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I am glad that Senator Daly was not present to hear that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600004#C00600","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1413452400,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I was not going to say that.

COPE is on the front page of this week's <i>Galway Advertiser<\/i>.  I met the organisation last Monday.  It dealt with 66 homeless people in one night, comprising 44 adults and 22 children, with 11 more sleeping rough in the city.  COPE has spoken of a significant crisis in the private rental market.  This morning, only two or three houses are eligible or made available by their landlords for the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, in Galway city.  There is also an issue with the availability of social housing.  In Galway, 4,000 people are on the waiting list.<br\/>Last night, I listened to a debate in which Fr. McVerry participated.  He believes that the figure of 10,000 houses over four years, equating to 2,500 houses per year, would barely keep up with the number of people becoming homeless, never mind the number of people currently on the waiting list.  The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, gave a presentation in European Union House this morning that touched on this matter as well as the issue of families in poverty.  There is a looming mortgage crisis, with banks foreclosing on families and private landlords and pushing people out of their homes.<br\/>The scale of the homelessness crisis has not yet hit home with the Government.  I call for an emergency debate on the matter.  I appreciate that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, will introduce his Department's housing proposals, but this matter crosses a number of Departments, including Social Protection where, as we have been saying, the level of rent supplement has not met the cost of renting in recent years.  No rent controls are in place either.  A cross-departmental approach is required to address this crisis, something akin to a Government task force.  More and more people are sleeping rough, yet I do not get the sense that this is a significant priority for the Government, given that it did make enough available in this year's budget.<br\/>As Senator Barrett suggested, instead of just considering this issue in terms of social housing, we should take a broader perspective.  Any of the Ministers with responsibility for housing and homelessness in their portfolios should be invited to the House to discuss this matter, perhaps at one of our Seanad consultation committee meetings.  As well as inviting other witnesses to discuss the matter in detail, it would be a good use of the Chamber, as the crisis is not being taken on board by the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600004#C01600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1413453000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I have just come from the launch of a very important report on sexual violence by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.

The report makes a number of significant recommendations, specifically on redefining and creating an offence of domestic violence and firming up the penalties.  It also makes recommendations on how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can improve its service to victims of domestic violence.  It also suggests a possible constitutional change.  We have had constitutional referendums on many issues recently, but a referendum to give constitutional protection to people who become the victims of domestic violence is something the Irish people would welcome and, I have no doubt, endorse.

As Members will be aware, the Swedish Government gave diplomatic recognition to the Palestinian state earlier this week.  The British House of Commons approved a backbench motion in favour of recognising Palestine.  I think Ireland should have recognised Palestine decades ago, but certainly when the PLO first agreed to recognise Israel.  It is particularly important in the aftermath of Israel's latest assault on Gaza that the international community sends out a clear message of support for the Palestinian people and for their right to self-determination and reaffirms our absolute disgust at Israel's continued decision to wilfully ignore for decades UN resolutions calling on it to end its illegal occupation of Palestine.  As a country we have always led on this issue.  We have led in terms of supporting the Palestinian people and lobbying on their behalf internationally.  Unfortunately, in the midst of Israel's latest assault on Gaza, that did not happen as our Government was silent and hid behind the EU.  I hope that in this case, since two of our EU partners have decided to recognise Palestine, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will show some courage on this issue and stand up and promote what is right internationally and not hide behind the EU.  Two other countries have had no difficulty in unilaterally recognising the state of Palestine.  It would be an important symbolic move to restate our support for Palestine-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600006#E00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1413453600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600006#E00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1413453600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>-----and our support for two states, the states of Palestine and Israel, living together, but everybody needs to be on the same  page.

In the past, its economic benefits were spread right throughout the country so that many small villages that did not have a hotel benefited.  In recent years, there has been a tendency for tourism to be concentrated in areas of population.  One sector that appears to be suffering too much is the bed and breakfast sector.  In the past, this sector was very important where five or six were located in small communities.  If four or five people stayed in each bed and breakfast, it meant that those people were spending money in the local economy.  One of the main reasons bed and breakfasts are suffering so much is that there is too much bureaucracy attached to them.  I would like to have the statistics but I believe that about 50% have gone out of business altogether.  The overheads are exceptional and it is almost impossible to provide a service at a competitive rate because of the NAMA hotel rates with which they cannot compete.  <\/p><p>The difficulty is that as tourism expands, the bed and breakfast sector will be required and only a small proportion of them will be available.  We still have discerning tourists coming to Ireland who do not want a hotel experience; they want a local community experience, and an experience of staying in an Irish home.  That has been a huge selling point of our hospitality image down through the years.  We have let it slip off the radar because, during the Celtic tiger, the tendency was to build large hotels in areas of population.  The NAMA hotel rates are a further blow to the bed and breakfast sector.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister to come to the House for a debate on tourism in general and not to take for granted that it will continue to be stable and vibrant, and continue to grow.  That would be a mistake because we are also facing competition from other countries.  Tourism has not been getting the attention it should have been receiving for 20 or 30 years when it would have been centre stage because we regarded tourism as something we were good at.  We had so many attractions, natural and otherwise, that tourism was a solid industry.  We are taking our eye off the ball.  The concept of all tourism going to built up areas, the areas of population, is not a good trend when it is done at the expense of other parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600006#E00600","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1413453600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>In response to Senator Averil Power, it is important to have a holistic debate on the current situation in the Middle East.

In the history of the Ombudsman's office, only three special reports have issued.  We all know the circumstances, including the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  In my view, a previous Government and a previous Minister did a grave disservice to a family who suffered deep loss and bereavement arising from a dreadful fishing tragedy.  The circumstances have not changed.  The current Government parties, individually and collectively - I was a member of that grouping - put forward in the last phase of politics before the D&aacute;il, Seanad and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine a strong request to the then Government to respond positively to the Ombudsman's report.  The circumstances have not changed one bit since then except that people have moved to different sides of this and the other House.  If the public sees no action by the Government on this report, it will ask why bother voting and why bother changing governments if nothing changes.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House and explain what is happening to the commitment we all gave to a family to respond to the Ombudsman's special report.  The Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, who has moved on to a much higher and significant phase on the European stage, put enormous work into that report.  It is a damning indictment of all of us if we do not implement her recommendations.<\/p> <p>I have asked for that on a few occasions but as the weeks and months pass, the pain, suffering and loss experienced by the families concerned has not diminished.

I emphasise in this context the words \"unauthorised\" and \"confidential\".  Under section 9(1) a committee member may disclose confidential information if authorised to do so by the Minister.  This provision is not intended to preclude general comments or discussion on everyday issues relating to the committee.  What we are talking about is, for example, unauthorised disclosure of ongoing and sensitive negotiation positions, either at national or EU level, which could be damaging to the official position, or information which is considered to be commercially or strategically sensitive.<\/p><p>It is important to note that section 9 is grounded in section 8, which allows the Minister to make appointments to committees and to share information with such parties to ensure good decisions and policy-making.  It is likely that many of the appointees will not be civil servants and will therefore not be covered by the same statutory obligations as the Civil Service on the disclosure of information.  It would be remiss if the statute allowing the appointment of such individuals did not provide that the information they receive as a result of such an appointment be protected.  Disclosure of information received as a result of appointments under section 8 is subject to the law.<\/p><p>I pointed out on Committee Stage that I had reviewed the issue of disclosure of information in the public interest, in consultation with my legal advisers.  My advice is that the words &quot;save as otherwise provided by law&quot; included in the existing text of section 9(1) accommodates the public interest and includes the range of legislative provisions dealing with releases of information.  The important point to note in this context is that confidential information may only be released when authorised by the Minister or as provided by law.  This means that committee members are subject to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, which was indirectly referenced by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh in his contribution on Committee Stage, the Freedom of Information Act and the Data Protection Acts, to mention but a few of the relevant provisions.  In the circumstances, I believe the provision is necessary and proportionate, and that to remove it may jeopardise the effectiveness of committees established under the Bill.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600008#G00500","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1413454800,"counter":117,"content":"<p>An bhfuil an Seanad&oacute;ir s&aacute;sta leis an bhfreagra sin?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600008#G00600","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1413454800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar sin ar feadh soicind.

It is a genuine confusion.  I understand the Minister of State did not accepted any of the 40 or so amendments that were tabled on Committee Stage and does not propose to accept any today.  That seems to be largely because this is a D&aacute;il Bill and it would have to go back to the D&aacute;il.  I said this to a Minister last week and he accepted this was the case.  It is about time the Government recognised the constitutional provisions for this House.  This House is supposed to reform, advise and strengthen legislation by amendment.  To refuse to accept any amendments whatsoever out of 40 or 50 amendments is absurd.  It makes a mockery of this House.  I know the Government wanted to get rid of this House, but they did not succeed, and it is about time that Ministers started thinking and accepting amendments from this House.<\/p><p>We discussed the Freedom of Information Bill the other day.  I have reservations about that.  It is far too broad and sweeping.  The Minister was pushing it, although secretly he would agree.  The legislation before us is a situation where information is being withdrawn from the public on the basis it would affect the efficiency of the committees.  I made the point about Cabinet meetings that confidential material marked &quot;private&quot; and exchanged between two Cabinet Ministers is now subject to Freedom of Information as a result of the new Bill.  That is absurd and will certainly inhibit discussion.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking and consistency because we are doing the reverse in this legislation in that we are saying that there will be no access to this information.  It also involves the appointment of members to boards.  This is the kind of thing that is at the centre of public disquiet about the appointment of people.  All such procedures should be open and fair.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State explain what a class E fine is?  How much is a class E fine?  I tabled an amendment on the Freedom of Information Bill, where the maximum a civil servant is subject to for deliberately destroying information is a &euro;3,000 fine.  That is far too weak.  The Minister agreed with me, but because he did not want to take the Bill back down to the D&aacute;il, he did not accept it.  This is the kind of parliamentary democracy we are in.  It may change a bit now that the numbers have changed in this House.  I said we on this side would not force divisions vexatiously or frivolously.  However, we sure as hell will do so on points of principle, and we have the numbers now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600008#G01700","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1413454800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>A Leas-Chathaoirligh-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600008#G01750","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1413454800,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Very briefly.

We have all gained from the two previous occasions we have had these debates on forestry.  The Minister of State mentioned that he is preparing a programme for the new year and issuing important documents.  I hope that he has benefitted from what we have been saying here.  It has been a very good dialogue between us.<\/p><p>The purpose of amendment No. 2 is that the Minister shall issue a replanting order.  The Bill provides that the Minister &quot;may&quot; issue a replanting order, and that would apply where trees had been felled or otherwise removed without a licence.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that crime must not pay.  While there is provision for a class E sanction and a &euro;2,500 fine on conviction or indictment, the trees will not be replaced because of the use of the word &quot;may&quot;.  We want the trees back.  That is what society as a whole wants.  The amendment is, like the Minister of State, pro-trees.  We are asking him to go harder on people who knock down some trees without an appropriate licence.  That is the purpose of that amendment.  <\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 provides that replanting must be implemented within one year of the felling of the previous trees.  In section 26(9), the Bill is again more relaxed on the duties of people who have trees.  It provides that &quot;the Minister may, with the consent of the owner, issue a replanting order in respect of other land owned by the owner instead of the land concerned&quot;.  It does not have a time limit on it.  As we mentioned on Committee Stage, we are concerned about stumps being left around, which makes for an unattractive landscape.  I have asked botanists if there are any obstacles to removing stumps and starting again and they say there are not.  Providing for a time limit on the replanting order would help the Minister in his work as well.  If people have an order for replanting they must proceed to do so rather than delaying it indefinitely with the resulting lunar landscape that we have in certain parts of County Wicklow.<\/p><p>The purpose of both of these amendments are to protect forests and to ensure that they are replaced.  They are in the spirit of the Bill and of the discussions that we had on the two previous Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600009#H01200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1413455400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The first amendment is a simple one with which we are all familiar - &quot;may&quot; and &quot;shall&quot;.

Lines 37 and 38 of the Bill are indeed, as Senator Barrett as said, extraordinarily weak.  Let us analyse them for a moment.  &quot;The Minister may&quot; - no instruction, he may, if he feels like it, if it is a sunny morning, if his digestion is in good order, well, he just may do this.  &quot;With the consent of the owner&quot; - this is a lovely one - somebody who swipes trees down and then we have to ask his permission to put them back.  That is fatuous in the extreme.  It is nonsense, whoever drafted it.  Furthermore, the replanting can be done on &quot;other land owned by the owner&quot;.  What are we at here?  He could destroy a beech tree in an avenue up to the remains of a great house or such like and then he could stick a fir tree up the back side of a mountain ten miles away where he also owns property.  That is what is in the Bill.  It is a farce.<br\/>I am challenging the Minister to accept this amendment, and to demonstrate that he also accepts the constitutional position of Seanad &Eacute;ireann to advise, guide and amend.  This phraseology here, in page 27 of the Bill, is a nonsense, and gives <i>carte blanche<\/i>to any pirate who wants to desecrate the landscape.  To recap, the Minister &quot;may&quot;, if he feels like it.  He must then of course seek the consent of the owner, who may be a complete crook, and if he manages to surmount these two obstacles, the owner then can plant a cherry tree in the garden of a bungalow somewhere.  It is nonsense.  The Minister knows it is nonsense as do his advisors.  The whole House knows it.  The only reason it would not be accepted would be because - oh, dear - it would be such a bother to take the Bill back to the D&aacute;il.<br\/>Let us have a bit of democracy.  I would be interested to see if the Minister of State will accept this amendment and I very much hope that he does.  So what if he causes a bit of bother among his colleagues?  They will only respect him for it.  The Minister of State is shaking his head sadly.

I would fully support Senator Barrett's amendment if it was specifically referring to \"felled without a licence\".  I understand that under the 1946 legislation, which is being amended in this legislation, a felling licence was accompanied by the condition that the land had to be replanted.  That is all well and good, but a number of issues with having a condition to replant land are at stake here from an agricultural point of view, particularly as regards agricultural economics and Food Harvest 2020.<\/p> <p>The condition to have to replant the land could create a lack of incentive for farmers to undertake a planting programme.  It runs contrary to the proper use of agricultural land across the country and to the objectives of the Food Harvest 2020 programme which is trying to increase land available for agriculture.

There are instances where replanting may not be the appropriate response, for example, where the unlicensed felling occurred on a riverbank or in the proximity of a protected species, such as the freshwater pearl mussel, where the disturbances caused by replanting could pose a threat to the species.  In such instances the Minister must be empowered to consider options other than replanting on that site.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 proposes to remove one of the options open to the Minister where unlicensed felling has occurred which is the replanting of alternative land to that on which the trees had been felled.  To remove this provision would be overly restrictive and would not best serve the interests of ensuring that the forest estate is maintained in a manner consistent with the objective of protecting the environment.  As regards the proposed amendment requiring replanting within one year, it is a matter of judgment having regard to the individual circumstances of each case as to the length of time that should be allowed for replanting to take place.  The key to this Bill has been flexibility and workable arrangements that facilitate all involved in forestry.  That is the key to our discussions with stakeholders and we went into great detail with them over the past nine months. <\/p><p>To impose an upper limit of one year, as proposed, ties the Minister&rsquo;s hands in a situation where a more flexible approach may be required, for example, if native oak woodland in a special area of conservation was removed the replanting options might involve using acorns from the remaining trees to regenerate the wood with native stock.

That is why we re-submitted it today in a different form.  I agree that where the trees are felled without a licence is a more serious case than where the licence is merely contravened.  In the last of the three cases, where it is seriously damaged, for example, by a storm, the owner would be relatively innocent.  That is why we tried to run them together.  The purpose of the amendment is that we shall replace such trees, in particular those which are knocked down without a licence.  The fine is inadequate but society wants the trees back.  The explanation that putting trees back beside a river could damage the fish stocks when they are merely replacing trees that were there before is a mystery.  What mysterious ingredients are in the new trees that would damage the fish stocks when the previous trees had no impact?  The legislation could require that the trees be replaced by the same varieties in which case the fish will not be in danger.<\/p><p>On the second amendment I fully agree with the Minister of State that it is a matter of individual judgment but I prefer trees to stumps.  That is my judgment and I want to get rid of the stumps as fast as possible to get the trees growing again.  I hope the Minister of State and whoever succeeds him will always favour trees over stumps.<\/p><p>I appreciate what the Minister of State says about flexibility.  I hope that generates a new spirit in this area, which is on we have tended to neglect.  It has a great future.  The spirit of co-operation is important.  We have to protect the trees in both cases, requiring them to be replaced and that it be done in a timely manner.  People in the industry should not think they can knock down a forest and leave ugly stumps around and so on and not participate with the same enthusiasm as the Minister of State in having a national forest playing an environmental, commercial and visual role.

I tabled this matter to highlight the need for a proactive strategy for Howth Harbour.  The harbour is massively under-utilised from the point of view of fishing, marine leisure activity and the broader tourism industry.<\/p><p>In 2009 the Minister of State's Department commissioned a report specifically on the fishery aspect of the harbour; it was a report covering a business plan for the development of the fishery harbour centres.  That report set out many areas where Howth Harbour could be further developed but, unfortunately, most of what was suggested has not happened.  I urge the Minister of State in his new role to put an emphasis on the development of our fishery harbours.<\/p><p>A local business contacted me about the obstacles it is facing in setting up a repair facility at the harbour.  One of the areas identified as an area of potential development in the 2009 report is that of repair facilities.  It is stated numerous times in the report that there is a need to enhance and develop the repair facilities in Howth Harbour and this has also been highlighted by other independent reports commissioned by the Minister of State's Department.<\/p> <p>The majority of the work carried out in Howth is done by foreign companies operating from Kilkeel, County Down.  If vessels require anything more than very minor repairs, they usually travel to Kilkeel because they cannot get them done in Howth.  The State loses revenue every time this happens and it makes no sense.<\/p><p>A company called Fleet Marine based in Howth goes on site in the harbour in vans to carry out minor maintenance work, but cannot do bigger jobs because it has no workshop in the harbour.  There is demand for it.  Howth Yacht Club wants these facilities, as do other people with boats based in the harbour.  They do not want to have to go to County Down; they want to do it in Howth.  Fleet Marine has put a number of proposals before the Department and has been contacting the Department for at least a year.  Although it has identified suitable empty facilities, it has come to nothing.  Could the Minister of State investigate this?  It is a major loss of potential business for the area.  It is disadvantageous from a fishing and from a marine leisure point of view not to have proper services on site.  It puts people off coming to Howth.<\/p><p>Howth Harbour is an amazing facility.  Although it is one of the most beautiful parts of the country with a beautiful harbour, fine restaurants and a great tourism service, the harbour area is underutilised.  In places on the Continent that have half of what we have, the water is full all the time.  They hold festivals, have maritime museums in France and make the most of their facilities from a tourism, community and leisure point of view.  Local community groups and Howth Yacht Club have done amazing work in attracting major events such as the Etchells World Championship.  Howth is Magic is a business group that puts together festivals such as the Dublin Bay Prawn Festival.  However, such groups constantly tell me that every time they want to hold an event, the red tape is ridiculous and it puts people off holding events.  Howth is Magic must go through a laborious process of sending in the same information it sent in for the previous year&rsquo;s festival and not knowing whether it will get approval.  From the point of view of a tourism calendar, such events need to be confirmed months, if not a year, in advance.  If one is going to promote an event internationally, one needs certainty and does not need to be arguing with local authorities, marine officials or anyone else two or three weeks before it, wondering whether one will get permission.  There is a desperate need for a broader strategy that sets out the type of events, whether fishing, marine or leisure, that should be provided in Howth and gives people a framework within which they can work.  If one is running the same festival as last year, one should not have to resubmit the same traffic management and health and safety plans that worked last year.  It should be more straightforward once it is within an agreed framework.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to take this on as a priority.  I encourage him to visit Howth.  I live a couple of miles down the road and will bring him out any day to meet the business people and see the potential that exists.  It is an area where the Minister of State could make a mark if he put a positive impetus behind it.  It would do wonders for both leisure and employment in the area.  I hope the Minister of State will give it his attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600011#K03200","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413457200,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue.  Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is one of the six designated fishery harbour centres, which are owned, managed and maintained by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  All six fishery harbour centres are first and foremost working fishery harbours.  However, each centre has unique features which facilitate a broad range of other diverse activities, including the ones the Senator outlined, which are important from both an economic and social perspective.  The Department is conscious of the importance of both fishing and non-fishing activities at the harbours and endeavours to facilitate and develop both.  This involves day to day operational support by harbour staff and management and development and repair of infrastructure, subject to available financial resources.<\/p><p>Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is no exception to this diversity.  In addition to fishing, there is a wide range of recreational users of the harbour, including the yacht club, sport fishermen, walkers, tourists and other social users.  There are a significant number of businesses, especially restaurants, operating in the harbour centre.  Notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, I am happy to be able to advise that in excess of &euro;3.2 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth as part of the Department's fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure development programme from 2011 to 2013.  This investment will result in a significant improvement in the traffic management system, the access available to persons of reduced mobility and the electrical infrastructure available.  It will, in addition, serve to act as a catalyst for the enhancement of facilities available to the marine leisure and tourism sector, boat repair facilities and business generally in the harbour.<\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Coveney, approved funding of &euro;1.18 million in March 2014 for the maintenance and development of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.  Major works for 2014 include the continued upgrading of the electrical system.  The development and upkeep of Howth as a state of the art fishery harbour centre supporting a broad range of marine related and other activities is, and will remain, an ongoing process.  Any suggestions from fishery harbour users for the development and improvement of the facilities at Howth will, as has been the case, be given due consideration.  The Burke-Mclver report was commissioned some years ago to provide a roadmap for future development of the harbours.  All the recommendations in the report that were implementable in the prevailing economic climate were subsequently introduced.<\/p><p>The Senator raised the issue of working with the stakeholders.  We are already doing this and have been doing it for some time.  My Department has established a harbour users forum for Howth.  The forum is a broadly based initiative which is open to all stakeholders to participate in.  It met most recently in January this year and will, I expect, meet again very early in the new year.  This forum, like similar fora in each of the harbours, provides an excellent platform for sharing ideas and obtaining stakeholder feedback, which ultimately helps inform decisions on the future developments in the harbour.  In addition, the Department's officials are available to meet harbour users collectively or individually as the need arises.<\/p><p>As I have said, Howth Fishery Harbour Centre is first and foremost a working fishery harbour.  The Department is conscious that it is also a very important tourist destination in addition to being a major venue for leisure activities.  With that in mind, the Department is anxious to increase the profile of the harbour for the betterment of the wider community in line with the Senator's request.  To this end, the harbour regularly approves applications for events, yacht races, local celebrations and various functions within the harbour precincts.  For example, in July 2014, the Asgard centennial celebrations were held at Howth Harbour, with the keynote address delivered by President Higgins.  It is estimated that this event alone attracted in excess of 25,000 visitors to the harbour.  In addition, the Department approved locating the Howth tourism information office within the confines of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre.  This facility opened in July this year.<\/p><p>Balancing the needs of the fishing industry with those of the wider range of harbour users while delivering on a public service remit will be foremost when considering future developments in the harbour.  Any new developments will be done on the basis of available Exchequer funding and competing national priorities.  I assure the Senator that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is fully aware of the situation, wants to help and will.  I can pass on the Senator's invitation to visit the area to the Minister and I know he will do it because he is very favourably disposed towards everything that is happening in Howth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600012#L00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1413457200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I welcome the students of Calasanctius College, Oranmore, to the Visitors Gallery.

I thank the Minister of State for his response.  He referred to the tourist kiosk, which typifies everything that is wrong and the point I am trying to make.<\/p> <p>The tourist kiosk is an 8 ft. by 8 ft. prefabricated container.  Fingal County Council wanted to install this temporary building at the front of the harbour because the previous tourist office was way down at the bottom and tourists did not see it when they came out of the DART station.  Even though there was tonnes of space at the front of the harbour where this could be temporarily located, it took months to get approval from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There was all kinds of wrangling.  Council officials were pulling their hair out because they were paying for all of the works.  They had the building and they were paying for the works, but they could not get approval from the Department to go ahead and do the works.  We had missed much of the start of the tourism season by the time the approval was finally put in place, which is typical.  Letters were going back and forth from the Chief State Solicitor.  I do not know what the cost of all of the stuff that was going on was., but it certainly cost more than the cost of the 8 ft. by 8 ft. container.  The whole thing was just ridiculous.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to the user forum, which I accept is in place.  The reality on the ground, however, is that people do not consider the Department to be very co-operative in terms of being proactive and wanting to do new things in Howth.  That is the difficulty.  It is a real problem.  If the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Coveney, were to consult any of the interested groups in Howth - I ask them to do so - they would get the same message.  The same thing happened in the case of the sea scouts.  The Department wanted to rack up their rent massively, which would have pushed them out of their current facility.  We had to argue over that for the best part of a year, just as we did in the case of the kiosk.  Everything seems to involve a row.<\/p><p>I accept the point the Minister of State made about the various events that have taken place in Howth.  The Asgard celebration was fantastic, as are the other festivals we have locally.  I know from the groups that organise these events every year that they endure a crazy degree of hassle to get approval.  I am talking about people who volunteer their own time in addition to running their own businesses locally.  It seems to them that the whole process is designed to discourage people from doing things.  There is a lack of productivity.  I think there is incredible potential there.  I ask the Minister of State to convey this message to the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  There is goodwill on the ground from local businesses, community groups and clubs like the yacht club.<\/p><p>I would like to mention another issue that shows how small the thinking is.  I understand the proposal the Department made with regard to paid parking has been parked, to use an unfortunate phrase.  The proposal to introduce paid parking in the harbour would not have covered its costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600012#L00400","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1413457800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>This is a very long supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600013#M00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1413457800,"counter":194,"content":"<p>It would have lost money.

If the procedures are not being followed, that is a different issue.  I would not like to stand over a situation in which locals are frustrated.  In most instances, they are voluntarily trying to do good things to help the community, to boost employment creation and develop the tourism industry in their local areas.  I will talk to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about this matter before responding to the Senator.  If what she says is true, I think we need to address the issue.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, for coming to the House.  I know it was a bit of a challenge for him to get here because the previous debate finished early.  I appreciate him coming in.<\/p><p>I previously raised the issue I am raising when the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, held the position now held by the Minister of State.  A delegation of Members of the Oireachtas from Galway West discussed the seaweed harvesting licensing regime with the then Minister at that time.  There are many facets to this issue.  Seaweed harvesting is an integral part of community life in Connemara and other parts of County Galway, County Mayo, County Donegal and along the west coast.  Many people harvest seaweed to supplement their income.  In days gone by, they would have done it to survive.  Seaweed is used for agricultural reasons and is sold to certain producers.  One of the largest processing companies in the State, Arramara Teoranta, which used to be owned by the State under the auspices of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltacha, was recently sold to a Canadian company, Acadian Seaplants.  We hope the industry can develop and flourish under this and other companies.<\/p><p>New information on the licensing regime with regard to the cutting of seaweed has come to light in the past year or so.  We understand the current law in this area is in place under the Foreshore Act 1933.  Although people should technically have been applying for licences, that regime was not really enforced until quite recently.  I was recently involved in a debate on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta with an eminent senior counsel, during which we discussed all the different ramifications of the legal scenario.  I am sure the Department is aware of them.  If there are pertinent rights on somebody's folio to the effect that they are allowed to cut seaweed, does that give them the right to continue to do so under the new regime?  I understand that the officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government who met us previously in the company of the then Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, are working on the new foreshore legislation.<\/p><p>A public meeting was held in Connemara last night because the local community wanted to discuss the exact intentions of a company that is applying for a blanket licence that would extend across a large section of shore in County Galway.  It is of serious concern to many seaweed harvesters that some bigger companies are applying for these blanket licences.  We know that before &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltacha sold Arramara Teoranta, it was beginning to apply for a licence from Loop Head in County Clare to Belmullet in County Mayo.  There were concerns about the impact that would have on the local seaweed harvesters.  The harvesters have organised public meetings locally to express their concerns about its implications for them.  They are concerned about whether they would be able to continue to operate under the auspices of a company that might be given such a licence.  Would such a company dictate the price they would receive, the times when they could cut seaweed, or the amount of seaweed they could cut?  Would they have much of a say in the industry?<\/p><p>One of the models I have been proposing is still worth looking at.  I would have proposed it to the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, previously.  Perhaps the seaweed harvesters could come together as part of some type of fair trade scenario, for example, by setting up a co-operative or something like that.  Such a move would allow them to negotiate with the different processors in the industry as a group.  They would not have to depend on a particular company to buy their seaweed.  They would be able to negotiate a good rate and good conditions for the work they are doing.  As we all know, it is very hard work.  Not everybody would be able for it or is interested in doing it.  Perhaps it was not clear for a little while after the Government reshuffle took place which Minister of State had been given responsibility for this area.  I now understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, is responsible for it.  I am glad he is in this role.  As a man who lives close enough to the coast, I know he will be able to clarify this.  I am not familiar with the current state of the seaweed harvesting industry in County Waterford.<\/p><p>People might say this is not a huge issue on a national scale, but it is in Connemara and many other coastal and rural areas.  It is seen very much as a traditional thing.  There are issues around the legality of the licences.  What rights are enjoyed by someone who has a folio and has permanent rights on their portfolio?  Do those who have always cut seaweed have squatters' rights?  The senior counsel with whom I discussed this issue in the media last Monday tended to think that a case could be taken by somebody who can prove they have cut and sold seaweed on a regular basis over a number of years on a particular stretch of the foreshore.  It is possible that they would have rights as well.  I hope the Minister of State can clarify that for us.  Can he tell us when the new foreshore Bill will come forward?  What are his plans for that Bill?  How does he intend to make sure the seaweed harvesters, in particular, are protected during the whole process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014101600013#M00700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1413457800,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I am happy to clarify this matter for the Senator.  Ireland's foreshore is a national asset.  It is essential that any activity or development on the foreshore takes account of the need to protect it.  The principal legislation governing the use of foreshore is the Foreshore Act 1933.  It is widely acknowledged that reform of this legislation is needed.  The Government is determined to bring forward a modern regulatory regime that harnesses the potential of our marine environment while protecting the resource.  To that end, last year it approved the drafting of a maritime area and foreshore (amendment) Bill and published the general scheme of the Bill.  The Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht considered the general scheme in November 2013 and issued its report earlier this year.<\/p> <p> Drafting of the Bill is ongoing with a view to its publication during the current Oireachtas session.   In brief, it is intended that the Bill will streamline the consent process by aligning the foreshore system with the planning system, reducing duplication between the processes, with consequential benefits for economic activity.<\/p><p>The Senator is concerned about the issue of seaweed harvesting in the context of the proposed Bill.  However, the foreshore consent process has a much broader reach and is used to regulate a wide variety of development, both public and private.  Such development often involves important and necessary infrastructure including telecommunication cables, offshore renewable energy installations and wastewater treatment plants.  Developments such as these are important both from a socio-economic and environmental perspective.  It is simply not realistic to place consideration of such applications on hold pending the enactment of new legislation.  The Bill has not been published yet and enactment is, therefore, some time away.  While the specific issue of seaweed harvesting is currently under review in the context of the Bill, I do not consider it appropriate to single out seaweed harvesting for special treatment in this regard.<\/p><p>I also want to clarify that under the provisions of the legislation I am obliged to make a determination on all applications for consent that fall within my statutory responsibility.  My Department will, therefore, continue to process applications under the terms of the current Foreshore Act.<\/p><p>Regarding the small number of applications currently with the Department for seaweed harvesting, each will be assessed in the context of the relevant regulatory framework, including obligations that arise under EU birds and habitats legislation.
