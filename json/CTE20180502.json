I will start by acknowledging the important role that Vicky Phelan has played in highlighting a number of major weaknesses in how people have experienced our national cervical screening programme, CervicalCheck.  The Minister has publicly commented on his swift action so far to address these issues.  He has also expressed his gratitude in public to Vicky Phelan, which I will do here again, for her courage in bringing forward these issues.  Without her, we would not have the opportunity to learn the lessons that I am confident we will learn from this circumstance.  Without attempting to set out a comprehensive roll call, she adds her name to a range of other patients to whom we are grateful who had to come forward in similar circumstances to raise issues of public concern, leading to improvements in the system.  Not least of these are Susie Long, Rebecca O'Malley, R&oacute;is&iacute;n and Mark Molly and Shauna Keyes, but there are many others.  Our challenge will be to derive what value and learning we can from Vicky Phelan's experience, which she courageously brought forward, and use them to improve the system.<\/p> <p>  Vicky Phelan was diagnosed with cervical cancer in July 2014 and, sadly, was informed in 2017 that her cancer was incurable.  In 2014, CervicalCheck's clinical audit of Ms Phelan's 2011 smear test result, which was reported at the time as normal, identified a query squamous cell carcinoma.  However, Ms Phelan was not made aware of this finding until September 2017.  This delay has raised serious concerns about the processes for providing information to patients and clinicians.<\/p> <p>  Subsequent to the controversy that arose surrounding her case, the HSE initially advised that, between 2008 and early 2018, 1,482 cervical cancer cases were notified to CervicalCheck.  The majority were women who had already been referred for further investigation or for treatment by CervicalCheck.  As part of the clinical audit process, these notified cases were re-examined and a number were flagged for further cytology review.  In 208 of these cases, the cytology review recommendations differed from the original results.<\/p> <p>  Last Friday, 27 April, the HSE established a serious incident management team, SIMT, to oversee and direct the management of this incident.  The SIMT has reported that approximately 162 of the 208 women involved have now been informed of the outcome of the audit process.  Communication with these women is ongoing.  We have further details, which we would be happy to share with members.  I regret to say that 17 of the 208 patients are deceased.  Like the Minister, we express our sympathies to the families of those patients.<\/p> <p>  Arising from the work of the SIMT, and as outlined by the Minister last night on the floor of the D&aacute;il, the number of cases of cervical cancer notified to CervicalCheck - 1,482 - does not represent all of the cases of cervical cancer occurring in Ireland since the establishment of the programme in September 2008.  I regret to say that I do not at this point have the necessary information to confirm how many additional cases this might represent, but work has started on ascertaining what that number is.  We will detail that work.  The Minister has directed that immediate steps be taken so that information from the national cancer registry on any additional case of cervical cancer that occurred during that period is provided to the CervicalCheck programme.  Any screening history that those additional cases may have - not all will necessarily have been screened - will be established.  If any of these women was screened through the CervicalCheck programme, her case will be reviewed in further detail, with cytology review where necessary.  A helpline has been in operation at the national cancer screening service since Friday and clinical staff are following up with women on their specific clinical questions.<\/p> <p>  Since 2008, some 3 million smears have been carried out by CervicalCheck.  It is important to note that the cervical screening test is not a diagnostic test, only a screening test, that is, a test to indicate the possibility of pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions, thereby identifying women who need to be referred for further investigation or follow-up.  Smear tests can produce false positive and false negative results.<\/p><p>Therefore, cervical cancer may well develop in the time interval between a negative screening test and the next scheduled screening in any cervical screening programme.  The current primary screening test used by CervicalCheck is a cytology test which is known to have low sensitivity, that is, it produces a not insignificant number of false negative results.  Naturally, many women are now concerned about their own health following the publicity surrounding CervicalCheck.  It is certainly our intention, if we may, to use the committee and its indulgence to reassure people about the performance of the programme in relation to those people.  In order to provide assurance, CervicalCheck will make the necessary arrangements to enable any woman who has had a CervicalCheck smear test to have a consultation with her GP, in order to help her determine whether she wishes to have a further test without charge.  These arrangements are currently being worked through and will be confirmed this week.  We will hear further detail of this over the course of the afternoon.<\/p><p> In addition, in February 2018, the Minister approved the introduction of primary HPV screening for cervical smear samples, and I can confirm that this will be introduced later this year.  A Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, health technology assessment has found that HPV screening would benefit women by making the screening process much more clinically effective as well as reducing unnecessary tests, and greatly elongating the interval between tests for individuals.<\/p><p> I would now like to turn to the steps that are being taken to ensure the integrity of the CervicalCheck screening programme.  Non-disclosure of information to affected patients has raised concerns for users within the health service.  Patients have an absolute right to be provided with honest, open and prompt communication about any adverse event that may have caused them harm.  This is underpinned in the medical practitioner's code of conduct and the HSE open disclosure policy.  The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which includes provisions that support open disclosure, became law last year.  These provisions were drafted to create a safe space for professionals to be open and transparent with patients in order that they would be given as much information as possible, as early as possible, including an apology where appropriate.  By doing this, we have taken away any fears that doctors may have in being open and apologising to patients, specifically, fears of creating legal liabilities for themselves.  There is no longer room for excuses.  The patient has a right to know and should be told.<\/p><p> The next step is to further strengthen and protect open and honest communications between patients and the health service by bringing forward proposals for mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable events.  A stand-alone patient safety Bill goes to Government next week to expedite this.  The Minister&rsquo;s intention is to have an independent statutory investigation to examine the CervicalCheck screening programme.  This investigation will have all the necessary powers to investigate the issues highlighted by Ms Phelan and will place particular focus on the quality assurance systems, clinical audit processes and communications with patients within the cervical screening programme.<\/p><p> As part of this, a comprehensive examination of the cervical screening programme in Ireland against international best practice and standards will be undertaken.  The investigation will also identify, within its terms of reference, any implications that may apply to other cancer screening programmes.  In addition to this statutory investigation, we are now working on putting in place, as a matter of urgency, an international clinical expert process to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review.  This panel will also produce an overall report to inform the statutory  investigation and the work of the international peer review group.  We are mindful of the need to provide support to these women and a liaison nurse specialist will co-ordinate the work of the expert group.  We intend to include patient advocates as part of that process also. <\/p><p> Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women aged between 25 and 39 years.  Every year in Ireland approximately 270 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and just under 100 deaths occur from it.  Cervical cells change slowly and take time to develop into cancer cells, making cervical cancer a preventable disease.  Even with the inherent challenges in screening, having regular smear tests can pick up early cell changes or pre-cancerous growths and reduce the risk of cervical cancer.  This is the scientific basis of screening.  I must emphasise how important it is that women continue to have their smears and take this test, which can and will continue to save lives.<\/p><p> It is our intention to take these necessary steps in order to ensure the integrity of the cervical screening programme while at the same time disseminating any learning to all cancer screening programmes.  These programmes are an important component of the progress that we have made over the past ten years in cancer survivorship for people in this country.  The Department is fully committed to the further development of our cancer services and to delivering the ambitious roadmap set out for these services as outlined in the national cancer strategy which was launched last year.  We will be happy to take any questions from the committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting to discuss the current issues surrounding the CervicalCheck Programme.  I am joined today by my colleagues Dr. Colm Henry, recently appointed as the HSE chief clinical officer; Dr. Jerome Coffey, national director of the national cancer control programme; Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director of the national women and infants programme; Ms Angela Fitzgerald, deputy national director of acute services; Mr. John Gleeson, programme manager of CervicalCheck; and Mr. Patrick Lynch, national director for quality assurance and verification and chair of the serious incident management team, SIMT.<\/p> <p>  I would like to begin by reiterating on behalf of the HSE my sincere apologies to all those women who have been affected and families involved in the CervicalCheck controversy, and others who although not directly involved have experienced any distress by what they have heard and read in recent days.  I also wish to state that I did contact Ms Vicky Phelan to apologise to her for the delay in telling her that her test results had been a false negative and I want to sincerely make that apology to her and her family again here today.<\/p> <p>  At the centre of this issue was our failure to communicate to the women that were the subject of the audit.  Those women should have been informed and that is something that will happen from now on.  It is essential that we re-establish confidence in our cervical screening programme, which is a critical public health initiative.<\/p> <p>  CervicalCheck, the HSE&rsquo;s national cervical screening programme, has provided a population-based cervical screening programme to the women of Ireland since 2008.  It is important to be clear and to understand that cervical screening is not a test for cancer, but a means of preventing it.  Cervical screening works by looking for changes in the cells of the cervix, the neck of the womb, using a smear test and cervical cytology.  The earlier abnormal cell changes are found, the easier they are to treat and the treatment of these changes in the cells of the cervix means that the risk of developing cervical cancer is reduced.  Screening is internationally accepted as a preventative health measure.  While it is recognised that no screening test is 100% accurate, cervical screening is the most effective method of reducing a woman&rsquo;s risk of developing cervical cancer.  By achieving and maintaining the targeted coverage rate of 80% as it currently does, CervicalCheck has the potential to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer significantly.<\/p> <p>  Since 2008, women in Ireland have been attending in increasing numbers.  CervicalCheck has achieved an 80% coverage rate among eligible women, a figure that is among the highest in EU countries.  Latest figures from National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, show that the incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland has reduced by around 7% per annum since the period from 2010 to 2015.  This means that fewer women will develop cervical cancer and there will be fewer deaths.<\/p> <p>  To date, CervicalCheck has provided 3 million cervical screenings to more than 1.1 million women.  It has detected more than 50,000 high grade pre-cancerous changes in women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without screening, would not have known they had pre-cancerous changes.  Furthermore the programme has detected more than 35,000 cases of low-grade cell changes and more than 1,200 cancers.<\/p> <p>  There are 15 clinics across the country which provide colposcopy services as part of the CervicalCheck programme.  Continued successful collaboration between the programme and colposcopy clinics nationwide has led to sustained improvements to colposcopy services and eliminated waiting lists.  The high standard of colposcopy has ensured that women who require a colposcopy are guaranteed timely access to a standardised level of quality-assured care.<\/p> <p>  In 2009 CervicalCheck participated in an external international peer review of the CervicalCheck quality assurance, QA, standards.<\/p><p>The international peer review panel consisted of those named on the printed version of the statement and I will not read the list out, subject to the agreement of the committee.  They are, however, a credible international set of experts.  It has been asserted that, in some way, the screening programme in this country is substandard to the US as it is asserted that the US screens every year.  However, the HIQA report of October 2009 on the evaluation of the use of resources in the national population-based cancer screening programmes and associated services presented the recommended screening interval internationally.  In the case of the USA, recommended intervals are initially two smears, one year apart, then every three years.  It is also important to note that much of the US system involves a self-select process, an opt-in which, in effect, is a voluntary presentation and not a calling or invitation system as in Ireland.  It is not an organised programme in that sense.<br\/><br\/>HIQA goes on to say in that 2009 report:<\/p><blockquote>A systematic review of the existing evidence base for the optimal age-range and screening interval for cervical screening was undertaken in order to determine if the current age-range (25-60 years) could be narrowed or the screening intervals increased.  Based on the literature review, the current age range and screening interval adopted in the CervicalCheck programme in Ireland would appear to be consistent with the international evidence base.<\/blockquote><p>The HIQA report also noted that CervicalCheck administration has achieved the ISO 9001-2000 quality certification and maintains this standard through regular internal and external audit.  A comprehensive smear taker training prospectus has also been developed and underpins a smear taking training programme developed and delivered in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, the National University of Ireland Galway, and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.<br\/><br\/>There has been much commentary on the outsourced CervicalCheck laboratory services.  In that regard, I would like to make the following comments.  A procurement process for the provision of cytology laboratory services was undertaken in December 2007 with the publication of a notice in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union <\/i>in line with public procurement regulations.  The requirement of the NCSS was that each potential contractor would need to meet certain criteria, including that they must hold third party accreditation from a recognised accreditation body to international standard ISO 15189; have capacity to screen a minimum of 25,000 cervical smear samples per year; have capacity and ability to process smears within a ten-day turnaround in order to facilitate the delivery of results to women within four weeks of their smear test; and hold independent quality accreditation of the service.<br\/><br\/>On completion of the procurement process, a private sector provider of laboratory services, Quest Diagnostics Inc., was appointed for the provision of cytology laboratory services.  In addition to the criteria above, each slide analysed by the laboratory is examined twice by two separate cytologists.  CervicalCheck, in line with public procurement guidelines, re-tendered for laboratory services in 2009 and again in 2012.  Following the 2009 procurement process, Medlab Pathology Limited was appointed along with the previous incumbent Quest Diagnostics Inc.  In 2012, a further tendering process took place and the two laboratories mentioned above were appointed under a HSE framework agreement.  This framework agreement is still active today and both Quest Diagnostics and Medlab Pathology are still providing cytology and HPV laboratory services, under contract, on behalf of CervicalCheck.<br\/><br\/>I now want to address the findings of the serious incident management team, SIMT, report.  I have submitted the full report, which is also available at <i>hse.ie<\/i>, to the committee with the opening statement so I will highlight some of the key issues here.  Over the past week there has been considerable public focus on, and concern about, the cervical screening service.  Much of this concern stems from an audit of 1,482 cases of cervical cancer reported to the programme in the period between 2008 and 2018.  The CervicalCheck clinical audit process examines the screening history of all notified cases of cervical cancer, with a date of diagnosis since the programme commenced in September 2008.  The cases covered by the audit were those cases of cervical cancer notified to the programme and not the larger number of cases notified to the National Cancer Registry for the same period.  The programme advised Department of Health officials on Friday evening that the figures were based on the cancer registry figures and it was on this basis that the Minister was briefed.  It was subsequently determined by the SIMT that this was incorrect.<br\/><br\/>The audit process is an opportunity to see if any aspect of a programme could be improved.  The process can also provide more detailed information to women on the reasons their cancer was not prevented, as well as information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening.  Of the 1,482 cases notified and logged to date, 442 cases, 29%, were flagged for review of one or more elements of the cervical screening pathway, which includes programme operation, screening, cytopathology and HPV testing, colposcopy or histopathology.  Cases are reviewed by an internal review group, with the support of an independent pathologist.  The most common review type, as expected in a cervical screening programme, is of cytology, that is, the smear test, due to its inherent limitations as a screening test.  Cytology reviews are performed internally by the original reporting laboratory, and by independent laboratories if a further opinion is required.<br\/><br\/>In February 2016, the programme commenced formally communicating review outcomes of historical notified cervical cancer cases where prior cytology had been reviewed to the consultant doctor looking after an individual woman diagnosed with cervical cancer.  All historical reviews were communicated to treating doctors by October 2016 and the programme has been communicating current cases since that date.  While the audit process established by CervicalCheck is seen as good practice and has the potential to make an important contribution to improving the quality of the programme, there was some evidence that the women whose cytology smear test had been reviewed as part of the audit process had not been informed either of the review or the outcome as it pertained to them.  The women whose cases were reviewed already had a diagnosis of cancer so the outcome of the review of their cytology smear test would not have changed their diagnosis or treatment.  They were entitled, however, to know that their case was reviewed and the outcome of that review.  This was particularly important where the review team drew conclusions that were different from the original interpretation of the smear result.<br\/><br\/>The SIMT established that there were 208 women who should have been communicated with in relation to the review process.  These were women where the CervicalCheck review team interpretation of their smear result was different from the original smear interpretation.  Of these, 175 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result and, based on the opinion of the review team, this would have led to a different clinical escalation, namely, a referral for biopsy or colposcopy.  Of the total, 33 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result but, based on the opinion of the review team, they would not have recommended different clinical management other than an earlier repeat smear.<br\/><br\/>On 30 April 2018, following the review of patient charts over the weekend, it was established that of the 208 women concerned, 46 women have already been communicated with and 162 women had not been told.  Each hospital group was then required to ensure that each of the 162 women who had not been told of the review outcome would be phoned on Monday, 30 April and Tuesday, 1 May 2018.  They would be offered an appointment to meet the appropriate senior clinician during the week ending Saturday, 5 May 2018.  There were 17 women in this cohort who have died.  It has been established that two of these women had the results of their review communicated to them before their death.  It is acknowledged that, in addition to a diagnosis of cancer, finding out at this stage that they were the subject of a review will be distressing.  The SIMT is confident that the clinicians meeting with these women or their next of kin will be very sensitive to the context of this information.<\/p><p>While the women who were the primary focus and concern of the work of the SIMT had all received a diagnosis of cancer at the time of their review and the review would not have changed the outcome, they were all entitled to know the review had been conducted and its outcome as it related to them.  This openness and transparency should lie at the heart of a caring and compassionate health care system.  Many women may be worried because of the recent coverage, and there is useful information available on .<br\/><br\/><b><i><\/i><\/b>During the course of its work, it became evident to the SIMT that the number of cases audited by the screening programme varied from the number of cases of cervical cancer reported to the National Cancer Registry over the same period.  The SIMT immediately took action, escalating this matter to me.  This, as the chief medical officer has already referenced, will result in the National Cancer Registry being mandated to share its data with the programme, the lists being reconciled, and an immediate audit of these remaining cases being undertaken.<br\/><br\/>I would like to conclude by saying that I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he is establishing a statutory investigation, which will be carried out by HIQA.  I also welcome the appointment of an international clinical expert panel to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review.  The HSE will fully co-operate with both processes to ensure we establish all of the facts surrounding what has occurred and, above all, so we can learn from what has happened and ensure it does not occur again.<br\/><br\/>Given that I started my career in the public service in BreastCheck, the recent events are indeed a personal blow to me.  I do not have many more weeks in my role.  Indeed, I have only a few months because, as members know, I announced some time ago I would not be remaining beyond the term of my current contract, and consequently I intend to devote the greater part of those weeks to addressing these issues.  In that regard, as I believe the Taoiseach confirmed earlier, I have appointed Mr. Damien McCallion, one of our senior national directors, currently responsible for emergency management, among other duties, to take charge of the national cancer screening service from tomorrow so all the issues that need to be worked through as we deal with this can be managed by him.

As this may be a prolonged meeting, witnesses and members may take a break after two hours, if they wish.  It is very important for the members and witnesses to note that the women at the centre of this controversy should remain our main focus.  The setting up of an inquiry that will seek the truth on this issue should concern us.  We should concentrate on that and not take political issues into account.  The issues that arise this evening relate to trust.  There has been a breakdown of trust.  There has been a loss of trust in the CervicalCheck programme.  There have been a breakdown in and failure of open disclosure.  There has been a destruction of confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.  That needs to be restored as quickly as possible.  Full disclosure might not have affected treatment but it certainly would have altered women's ability to respond to the information.  It might have afforded an opportunity to seek redress elsewhere, as Ms Vicky Phelan did.  Therefore, non-disclosure had a significant effect.  It raises issues regarding governance, accountability and the cultural change required in the HSE and the Department.<\/p> <p>  I have three questions to start the meeting.  The first is for Mr. John Gleeson.  How could open disclosure not be part of the CervicalCheck programme?  It seems quite difficult to understand.  The cervical cancer registry and the CervicalCheck database did not match.  How could that possibly be and how could there have been such a breakdown in communication?  My third question is for Mr. O'Brien.  Is it now possible to say we know all the information in regard to this issue?  Have we identified each person who requires a smear case audit but who has not had one thus far?  Has the total number of patients been identified?  Perhaps these questions could be addressed first.<\/p> <p>  Members will have ten minutes each for questions and answers.  Witnesses are advised to keep their answers as concise as possible, just as I hope members will keep their questions as concise as possible, to allow every member to engage.  Perhaps Mr. Gleeson might address the two questions addressed to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#NN00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>On the Chairman's first question, on open disclosure, we started the process of cancer audit in 2010 with a view to ensuring quality assurance and continual improvement and through 2014 decided to review it and then commence, in line with the published HSE open disclosure policy of 2013, an evaluation of what that meant in screening terms, mostly in terms of defining serious incidents.  It did not make specific reference to screening, which is different.  One is dealing with people who do not have symptoms.  It is not like people in hospitals; it is a different cohort of the population.  Without trying to not do open disclosure, we went about trying to figure out how best to do it in respect of women we were concerned about because, after all, they had been diagnosed with cervical cancer.  We were looking at something before that point in time and how to communicate it but we did develop the process.  It took a considerable amount of time, for which I apologise, but the intent was always to let the women know.  We looked to practices in England and elsewhere to determine how that might best be done.  It was always felt that the treating clinician of the woman at that time was the best channel through which to communicate with her.  We would not know the context surrounding her current care and treatment at whatever stage she was at in her plan to address the diagnosis.  We did develop and implement the open disclosure and communication policy in respect of treating clinicians.  Admittedly there were certainly gaps, for which we apologise, in terms of making sure the information actually got to the women but our intention was always that information we had that related to a woman should be made accessible to her.<\/p> <p>  Could the Chairman repeat the second question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":25,"content":"<p>The second question was on the incompatibility of the National Cancer Registry and CervicalCheck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#NN00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>The National Cancer Registry is a different statutory body.

It does not operate the other way, however.  If the National Cancer Registry is registering a cancer &mdash; in our case, cervical cancer &mdash; it does not go the other way.  The National Cancer Registry was given access to the cervical screening register in order to be able to report, in an aggregate way, on the programme.  It is a question of whether, over time, we can reduce the incidence and whether the detection of cancer will start to move to an earlier stage to give a better prognosis.  The national screening service measure was under way to implement a data-sharing agreement in line with the forthcoming GDPR to make that communication two-way.  We also felt in the early years, however, that most of the women would not have engaged in cervical screening.

That is just by way of comment.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. O'Brien.  He stated at the press conference that he found out about what he describes as a failure to communicate - and perhaps he might want to revisit that description of what we are discussing today -  in the media.  I am interested in trying to get to the bottom of this.  A circular issued in 2016 is at the heart of the failure to communicate, as Mr. O'Brien describes it.  It advised clinicians simply to add a copy of the audit to the file and use their clinical judgment on whether to tell a woman something about her own health and, in a case where the poor unfortunate patient had died, to stick a note on the file.  When that circular was being drafted, and I understand it was signed by someone who was a member of the senior management team, senior clinicians and senior people in the HSE presumably were involved in drafting a circular of this nature.  It stretches credibility a bit for me that these people, members of Mr. O'Brien's senior team, would not have communicated to him on an issue as serious as this.  If we want to talk about open disclosure and being full and frank, I hope we can get away from what we have had in recent days, which is an endless round of people - mostly men as it goes and no disrespect intended to men - describing to women what it is like to have a smear test and how important it is.  I do not need any of that advice.  I have been having smear tests for 22 years, since I had my daughter.  I understand how important it is.  I also know it is not a diagnostic test and I understand it is a screening test.

Mr. O'Brien outlined the procurement procedure involved and stated that serious concerns were raised in various quarters.  It would seem obvious to me that if domestic concerns had been expressed about the process then two years into it Mr. O'Brien, as the person in charge, should have reviewed the outcomes.  Perhaps I missed something in the opening statement.  Under the heading, the procurement of cytology laboratory services, in his opening statement he referred to capacity of a laboratory and the turnaround time.

I know that much has been said on the issue of public confidence.  I am not suggesting in any sense that the Deputy is taking us back in comparison, but it is worth pointing out that before the programme was established in 2008 - and this is a ballpark figure - we were doing somewhere in the region of 300,000 smears a year.  We were sending the smear tests to small laboratories, where we were getting poor quality assurance, QA and we had no QA to tell us what the performance was.  Some of the women being screened were being screened far too frequently and others were not being screened at all.  We were having no impact on mortality.  I can remember testimony by clinicians, particularly from those who came back to work in this country around that time about the late stage of presentation of young women with young children with cervical cancer.  That situation has not changed completely, but it is changing substantially.  We have had since 2010 a substantial reduction in the mortality associated with the programme and a range of other factors that allow us to say that people are being identified.  <br\/><br\/>We heard earlier about the 50,000 or so women who have been identified with early stage changes that could be dealt with definitively.  If we continue with the performance parameters that we are seeing with our programme, we can be confident that we will continue to drive down that mortality.  When we supplement that with what we are doing in terms of HPV screening, which will start later year, we can be confident in the screening performance of that.  We have substantial reason to continue to express high confidence as leaders in the health care system.  All of our health care practitioners should be in a position to continue on the basis of the data that we have available to us.  I can make available to the committee an article that was published in the <i>European Journal of Cancer Care<\/i>about three years ago, based on a side by side comparison, questionnaire based.  This analysis of cervical cancer screening programmes around Europe confirmed that we have one of the most organised, highest performing and most quality assured programmes anywhere in Europe.  Many of the features we are talking about here today are exhibited by very few organised programmes.  Many well-known countries, First World countries as it were, do not have that type of organised programmes.  The basis for us to continue to reassure people that they can have confidence in the programme, confidence in the results of their tests on the basis of its performance remains.  That has not been changed by any of the unfortunate experiences that some of the people of whom we have talked about have had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#TT01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":222,"content":"<p>The issue is public confidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#TT01600","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>That is exactly what I am trying to address; the public can have that confidence in the performance of the programme and in the test results that they are getting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#TT01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Coffey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#TT01800","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I wish to make one brief comment in response to the question on public confidence.

Was legal advice sought by either the HSE or CervicalCheck, on that?<\/p> <p>  The second question I have relates to when the first legal letter came in on this matter and who it came to.  There would have been an exchange of legal correspondence before proceedings started.  Who did it come in to and why did that not set off alarm bells at that stage about notifying the other people who were involved?  Why has it been the case that we have had to wait for it to go all of the way to court before we have now decided to notify all of the other people involved?  Can these matters be clarified?

There is going to be huge increase in the number of people looking for repeat smears.  What system has been set up to deal with the increased volume of repeat smears that are going to be taken and analysed?  Has any process been looked at at this stage in relation to that area as regards ensuring that, if there is an increase in volume, that they can be dealt with in an expeditious manner?<\/p> <p>  Finally, my understanding is that there are 15 clinics.  Some of those clinics had raised concerns with the people directly at the top of the organisation over the last number of years.  Can it be clarified whether there were regular meetings with the principal people involved in these 15 clinics, or was it all by email and by telephone?  I have received information to the effect that some people in the clinics based around the country had expressed concerns about issues as they arose but found that their concerns were not being taken on board.  Was there a mechanism where regular meetings occurred on an overall basis between the 15 clinics and the people who were in charge of the entire programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#UU02100","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":252,"content":"<p>First, I will deal with the questions in sequence, I will then hand over to Mr. Gleeson for certain points.<\/p> <p>  The first point about disclosure which is critical and central here, a decision not to share is the reverse of my reading of the process in this situation.  There was a clinical audit ongoing.  There was a very protracted discussion both nationally and internationally about models of disclosure, concerning how and when to disclose.  That is where the debate was; it was not designed not to disclose.<\/p> <p>  What has evolved, apart from the reference earlier to the information being sent to the clinicians, was a patient information leaflet for patients telling them, where appropriate, that a review had taken place, and a very simple mechanism to trigger an appointment with a clinician to discuss all elements of the review.  <\/p> <p>  The second point I will leave to Mr. Gleeson, regarding the current case and when correspondence started.<\/p><p> The third point is that we anticipate an increased volume of smears, but it is very hard to quantify.  Our actions this morning were to make sure there was the capacity, where clinically appropriate, to enable women to have smears without delay.  That is open-ended.  We do not know how long the interest and anxiety will last for, but we are prepared to keep the enhanced resourcing until everybody has had their questions answered to their satisfaction and, where appropriate, additional smears will be taken.

That is the most tragic thing in this circumstance because, unless the CervicalCheck programme continues to receive the active participation and support of the 80% of those eligible who have supported it up to now, we will be in danger of seeing a reversal in the trend for cervical cancer.<br\/><br\/>I have explained &mdash; some people have taken issue with my explanation &mdash; that what is at the heart of why we are here now is that a decision to carry out reviews or audits and then to communicate the results to the individuals concerned fell apart at the implementation stage.  That is kind of what brings us to where we are now.  As Dr. McKenna has outlined, even <i>in extremis<\/i>based on the estimates we have heard and even if all of the cases were missed opportunities for diagnosis, they fall, in total, within the parameters of a successful screening programme because screening programmes are not 100% effective.  The benefit of this screening programme is that 50,000 women have had a diagnosis of high-grade cell changes resulting in early treatment, resulting in their being able to avoid developing cancer.  Consequently, the numbers of cancers have fallen and the number of deaths has fallen.  These are really important health benefits in respect of which we must collectively try to do our best not to lose because it would be to the detriment of everyone if the trend went backwards.  In addition to putting matters to right for the women who were not given the information they should have been given, one of our greatest focuses and one that has been our immediate priority is restoring public confidence.  Without it, we will pay a huge public health price.  That is why I am focusing on this now to the extent that I am and why I have taken the steps with the movement of Mr. Damien McCallion to take personal charge of the national cancer screening service.<br\/><br\/>I ask Mr. Patrick Lynch to speak about how alarm bells should be treated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#WW00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":276,"content":"<p>A range of things happen anywhere in the health service on any given day.

That is because this form of testing is internationally understood to be 70% accurate.  It is a screening test and not a diagnostic test.  It was always inevitable that the screening programme, as with all population screening programmes, would not provide a pathway to diagnosis for every woman who might have been able to benefit from it.  At the outset, based on all the public health information available, and in any country that has decided to have a screening programme for any population-based cancer, the decision is made to have the screening programme based on the benefit it can deliver as opposed to the benefits it will not deliver.  That benefit, as I characterised earlier, is a 7% reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  The detection of high-grade cervical cell abnormalities among 50,000 patients, enabling them to have treatment, means they will not go on to develop cervical cancer.  There have been 1,200 women diagnosed with cervical cancer through the programme, the result being that they could start their treatment pathway earlier than otherwise.<\/p> <p>  The issue to which the Deputy is referring is the relationship or suggestion that the decision to provide the cervical cytology testing through laboratories outside Ireland is in some way connected with this.

I wish to ask about the claim Mr. O'Brien has just made to the effect that 70% is the average accuracy of the test.  That is not the figure that was cited on the D&aacute;il record in 2008.  What is a not insignificant number?  I will group my questions, if the Chairman does not mind, because I have only half the time of the committee members.  Why is the accuracy so low when, in 2008, Irish labs had a 95% accuracy rate, according to Senator James Reilly, who went on to become Minister for Health and who is a doctor.  I assume he was not telling a lie.  Why would we move to a system that, according to other experts at the time, had an 85% accuracy rate?  I refer to the US system.  I am not just blaming the witnesses.  These were political decisions that were taken.  The witnesses are managers.  I put it to them that this was testing on the cheap.  At the time, Mr. O'Brien, in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>published on 9 May 2008, said he was satisfied Quest Diagnostics could provide the required quality of testing.  However, the emphasis in his opening statement today seemed to be on getting 25,000 smear samples done a year with a high turnaround to get the results back in people's hands by a certain amount of time.

Dr. Gibbons and other scientists subsequently resigned because their concerns were ignored and dismissed.  When that was put to Mr. O'Brien, he said that he had addressed those concerns in the final contract before it was awarded to Quest Diagnostics.  Will the witness describe how he addressed those concerns?  What was written into the contract?  If Mr. O'Brien was prepared to address those concerns, why was that not indicated to the scientists at the time, instead of forcing their resignation?<\/p> <p>  He subsequently said he was happy with the standards applied by Quest Diagnostics.  Mr. O'Brien must have been happy with the standards applied by CPL in Austin, Texas, as well, because he awarded it the contract.  However, CPL is the company that was successfully sued by Ms Vicky Phelan.  It settled with her for &euro;2.5 million.  Why would the company have settled with her if there was not a difficulty?  I would like a brief answer. <\/p> <p>  I have read the press release from the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine on cervical screening.  It has called on the Minister for Health to publish the results of the 2014 audit.  When I asked the Minister in the D&aacute;il last night to do that, he said there were no results of the audit - there were just individual reports for individual women.  I spoke to a friend of mine who is a scientist about this today.  She said that would be extraordinary because every audit has to have at least an introduction, the basis on which the audit was carried out, why it was carried out, what triggered it and what the terms of reference were.  That is the very least.  An audit will not just have Margaret's results, Ruth's results and Br&iacute;d's results and a description of how they have been looked at.  There has to be a description and a report back.  We are looking for that to be published.  I echo the call by the academy for the 2014 audit to be published.  I would like Mr. O'Brien to comment.  <\/p> <p>  When the State Claims Agency, and I think it was Mr. Gleeson, was alerted that there was a claim made by Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. O'Brien said he did not know anything about it until last Friday.  I do not believe him.  I do not believe that the Minister did not know.  Other people might believe Mr. O'Brien but I doubt it.  I think there are thousands of people out there who do not believe Mr. O'Brien.  There may not be a paper trail or a smoking gun, an email or anything else but there could have been a conversation.  Did Mr. Gleeson keep this to himself as a secret or did he discuss it verbally with anybody else?  Would Mr. Gleeson get information like that, in a position of responsibility, and keep it all to himself?  If Mr. O'Brien, as the head of the HSE, did not know until last Friday, he must be hopping mad.  He must be looking for heads to roll over this.  If he is not, I wonder why.  I think anybody else would.  I have one more quick question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#YY01000","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>The Deputy is eating into the time for the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#YY01100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I know.

There are many different statistics that appear to be in conflict with each other but they are not.  When we talk about sensitivity and specificity of a test, it means a different thing when we talk about false positive and false negative.  They are technically different things.  It is a different thing again in terms of a yield and how likely it is, and how positive one can be that the result that is negative is in fact negative.  They are different measures and they are being used interchangeably.<\/p> <p>  It is important we are given time to be able to set this out for the committee in a way it can understand.  I am not suggesting Deputy O'Reilly is doing this, but the way in which various statistics are being used is creating an impression that there is a conflict that is not in fact there.  If I can give an example, and I am not going to quote in terms of the screening programme and its figures because we can calculate those figures off the performance of our own programme, but if we are talking about something that is 80% sensitive this means there is an 80% chance that if a disease is there a test will find it, and there is a 20% chance that if the disease is there it will not find it.  This is what the 80% means.<\/p> <p>  Whether or not we can rely on the test being negative when we get a negative result depends not only on the sensitivity but also on the incidence of the disease in the background population.  I appreciate this is a technical epidemiological point I am making.  If a disease has a frequency of 1% and a test is applied that has a sensitivity of 80%, there is a different likelihood of it being positive or negative than if the disease had a frequency of one in 10,000.  All of these factors bear.<\/p> <p>  The statements that are being made about the performance of the test, and its sensitivity and specificity being low, at in and around 70% in relation to sensitivity, is correct.  It is broadly in line with the performance of the test in international hands.  Statements have been made about negative predictive value, in other words, if I get a negative test how likely is it that the disease is not present.  This is a very small figure.  It is a percentage figure that probably for the performance or test might even be much lower than the figure that has been given, and I am not in any sense disputing the figure my clinical colleague has given.  He may be referring to a different patient population where a higher incidence of the disease might exist.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we do not get confused and create a sense in which figures that are really important in terms of people's ability to be able to rely on the test and rely on the information they are getting in terms of predictive value, in some way appear on the part of the programme to be confused.  I take the point that in general terms the programme should, on a continuing basis like any source of information, continue to improve its communication.  This is not in any sense to say that erroneous information is being transmitted to patients.  It is really important that we get this point across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#AAA02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Dr. McKenna said he would change the leaflet.

It states: \"What has happened is totally inappropriate.\"  That is referring to withholding of information from women.  What I want to know is, given that Dr. Henry, who is here, and Dr. McKenna who is also here, were aware that there were serious concerns, was any of this kicked up the line, and at what point?  Mr. Gleeson has already indicated that stuff got kicked up the line.  I am not quite sure what that means.  We might get a chance to go back to that.  Was any of this kicked up the line?  I find it absolutely extraordinary that Mr. O'Brien would not have been informed of a senior clinician who had serious issues with regard to the conduct of sharing information with women about themselves, which is material.

I thank Mr. O'Brien.  I would like to read out what the HSE defines as open disclosure, which is at the heart of all of this.<\/p><blockquote>An open, consistent approach to communicating with service users when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the service user informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event.<\/blockquote> <p>So, the question at hand is whether Vicky Phelan was afforded open disclosure, and whether many other women, and possibly men, within the national screening service have been afforded open disclosure, and indeed there is a wider question now across the HSE, due to this.  From what I have seen in the past week, there is a conspiracy of silence within the healthcare system when it came to Vicky Phelan's case and when it came to several hundred other women who were not informed of false negatives.  Senior people within the national screening service knew the details of Vicky Phelan's case and they knew that hundreds of other women had not been communicated with.  Senior management within the HSE knew those things as well, and the doctors knew those things - maybe not in the hundreds but they knew that their own patients had not been communicated with.  People at the very highest levels within the HSE, at the level of direct reporting to Mr. O'Brien, at a senior level within the national screening service and senior consultants, all knew for years that the false negatives had occurred and as of today all of the women still have not been told.<\/p><p>I will start with Dr. Henry.  We know that he was made aware of this issue, not just Vicky Phelan's case, but the wider issue of women not being afforded open disclosure, why did he not inform Mr. O'Brien as the head of the HSE, and why did he not act to begin to put in place the measures which are now being put in place, in an emergency response - because this has gone public?

The reply I received from the cervical screening programme was that it was the responsibility of the caring clinicians to provide this information.

It stated that on further reviewing the letter CervicalCheck sent down to Dr. Hickey with respect to an audit of the cervical smears on cancer patients, CervicalCheck highlighted just three it felt should be considered for recall on discussion.  Dr. Hickey wrote there were a number of others that looked as though there were significant discrepancies, and he was somewhat uncomfortable about just recalling the three that CervicalCheck had highlighted.  Dr. Hickey had ten patients.  This was active correspondence from a consultant saying this matter was affecting ten of his patients.  Doctors have been told to use their discretion, but clearly Dr. Hickey was being told by CervicalCheck that only three of the ten needed to be told.

I have a question for Mr. O'Brien.  How can Irish clinicians conduct multi-disciplinary teamwork with people in different time zones, who use different nomenclature and perhaps different terminology regarding cervical cytology?  That is the first question.  Second, from the time the cervical screening programme was introduced, and we did not have the capacity in Ireland because there was a backlog, was any attempt made by the HSE to increase the capacity in the Irish system?  When the backlog was dealt with abroad, was the HSE working to ramp up capacity in the Irish system, based on the concerns of clinicians in Ireland in 2008?  Doing the job in the United States was a third of the price of what it was here.  Did that ring any alarm bells when it came to quality analysis?  I have come upon the McGoogan report from 2004, which laid out what we should be doing before we had the screening programme.  Here is recommendation 1.7 on how it should be conducted:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;A management structure with clear governance arrangements is required to ensure that the legal obligations to eligible women, health care professionals and staff participating in the Programme including Phase One are met.&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>Another recommendation: &quot;The establishment of effective governance arrangements with immediate effect is necessary in order to provide overall leadership and direction in terms of policy development&quot;, and so on.Recommendation 1.12: &quot;A quality assurance (QA) programme should continue to be given priority in the ICSP.&quot;  The report further recommends that:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;Structures must be put in place to allow review or revision of quality standards by a National ICSP Quality Assurance Committee which should include representation from the Professional bodies, other key stakeholders such as the Cancer Registry, the Cancer Society and other cancer screening programmes&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>It seems that much of what was recommended did not actually happen.  Then I found the women's charter.  This is addressed to the women: &quot;All members of CervicalCheck staff will respect your privacy, dignity, religion, race and cultural beliefs.&quot;  It makes a commitment that women would always have the opportunity to make their views known and to have them taken into account.  Women are assured that their smear tests will be screened in an accredited quality-assured lab.  CervicalCheck also committed that a woman's result and any treatment recommendations would be provided to her and her nominated smear taker by the programme within four weeks.  In regard to that last point of the women's charter, I do not think Vicky Phelan got what it said on the tin.

Rather, I was invited to take up the role on the basis of a set of Government policies which were about the abolition of the HSE and the introduction of universal health insurance.  So I did the job in a particular way, in the context of that, for close to three years, expecting to be winding down the organisation and moving it into a collection of different types of service providers, hospital groups on a statutory basis and community health organisations.  As the Deputy knows, that did not happen.  I had discussions with the relevant Ministers.  What we have actually been doing is seeking to prepare the HSE for the type of future envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report as a result of which Government sanctioned: the appointment of a chief operations officer so that there is very clear accountability for the operating system; the appointment of a strategy and planning head in order that we have much more focus on planning to population need, as they do in other countries; and, just recently, for the first time ever in the Irish healthcare system, the appointment of a chief clinical officer.  So what I have been attempting to do in the second three years, and it has been extraordinarily slow because of the approvals processes one must go through, is come to a much more streamlined system of governance.  That is the only reason people have moved around in this context.  In an organisation the size of the HSE, people move around.  They have opportunities to apply for different jobs, posts become vacant and other people come in.  Yes, it is complicated.  An organisation the scale of the HSE is inherently complex.  I have long maintained that the structures of the HSE are in fact not fit for purpose.  I have been saying that throughout my time.  I have now got to a point where I think, subject to the implementation plan for Sl&aacute;intecare, that there is a much coherent organisation of functions at the top level which is useful and valid.

Will this be the process in the future regarding any decisions that are to be made?  Will it go around the house and back again to the same place where it was two years previously?  Did that occur to Dr. Henry at the time?  I know he was not clinical director but surely it must have occurred to him that this delay was not acceptable.<\/p><p>My second question concerns the role of clinical director.  The clinical director was <i>in situ<\/i>for quite a period.  I know we are going back to 2008 when this process was set up.  The masters of the Coombe, Holles Street and the Rotunda have seven-year contracts.  In fairness, any of these roles are extremely demanding.  The person is dealing with a huge number of people and a number of different units throughout the country.  Likewise, a master of one of the maternity hospitals faces a huge number of demands.  Does Dr. McKenna not think the way forward might be to stipulate a defined period for the director's job?  The director can reapply when the job comes up for review but that process would be there.  I am just looking at the way forward.<\/p><p>What kind of timescale would be involved if we decided tomorrow morning that we wanted all smear tests to be dealt with here?  I know the Coombe is carrying out some analysis in this area in the sense that it is providing a service.  My understanding is that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland had a laboratory but that this service has now gone out to private enterprise.  I stand open to correction on that.  The process is being provided in Ireland.  How long would it take to put in place the requisite number of people with the skills necessary to deal with all of the smear tests that are done here?  Would it take two, three or four years?  What kind of period would it take us to build up those skills?  It is important to look at that.  Given that we have been sending tests out and using US companies for over ten years, surely we should be looking at trying to keep all of this work within the Irish jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#EEE00500","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":575,"content":"<p>As I outlined before, I first became aware of this on 11 July 2017.

To be honest, that information should be at the top as the witnesses knew this issue had emerged in the press.  The witness made some disparaging remarks about tests being done on the kitchen table.  That is at odds with what Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith said.  He is not an insignificant person as a former master of the Rotunda Hospital and he called the service it ran accredited and world class.<\/p> <p>  One cannot dismiss the fact that this was predicted by people ten years ago.  In addition, they said it would be ten years before these problems would emerge.  Some &euro;20 per test multiplied by 3 million, which is &euro;60 million, was paid to a private company which makes massive profits and has connections with Goldman Sachs.  These people are in it for a reason, and it is not for patients.  That was not purely the HSE's decision.  The witness is correct that the D&aacute;il voted for that, despite counter arguments at the time.  The majority of parties, even if they ranted about it at the time, did not challenge it when they came into power.  It is the issue of public services being starved of resources and then being privatised.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the rate of testing.  My understanding, and I am open to correction, is that the NHS guidelines are that 50 tests per day is the recommended best practice level.  Quest Diagnostics was doing 90 to 100.  I tried to calculate the figures by dividing 25,000 by 365, but presumably laboratories do not operate for 365 days a year.  They might take weekends off, but I do not know.  However, the rate in Quest Diagnostics must have been nearly twice what the NHS recommends.<\/p> <p>  A screener is only supposed to carry out a maximum of 5,000 per year.  If there is pressure to make profit by getting as many tests carried out as possible these things are absolutely inevitable.  Corners were cut in women's health at a time when the economy was going into recession.  Again, political parties took that decision.

What I am trying to address here is a sense that we have evidence of a substantial failure of the cytology service that people here depend on for the reliability of the tests.  We have to try to reassure people about that because they are genuinely worried and concerned.<\/p> <p>  We carry out approximately 250,000 smears per year.  The abnormal rate that is reported, between high grades and low grades, is approximately 8,000.  I will call that 10,000 for the purpose of simplicity.  That is 240,000 negative test results per year.  We know we have approximately 300 incident cases of cervical cancer in this country per year.<\/p><p>We believe the test performs at the rate of about 70% sensitivity.  That means it misses about 30% of cancers that are present at the time of testing.  For simplicity, we will say that works out to be somewhere in the region of 100 false negatives.  That gives a false negative rate of substantially less than 1%, therefore, when the accuracy figure of 99% set out in the figures is quoted, it is based on statistics like that.  That is a back of the envelope calculation.  What I am trying to illustrate is that the general assertion - I do not suggest Deputy Coppinger is making this particular assertion - is that there is some evidence here of a substantial failure in the cytology service being used to give people reassurance.  We simply do not have evidence of that.  There have been substantial failures.  There has been clear admission in regard to them, particularly in terms of unacceptable failures of communication to patients, but that cannot be equated with a statement or review.  I have to make that point about the cytology service and the evidence we have in terms of performance.  The point has been made by the director general that the differential performance, about which again there is a legitimate question, can be provided by way of response to the committee.  That may well help to satisfy some of the questions that have been asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#GGG01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I am going to extend Dr. Holohan's time.  I have a question on that.  In a case of a false negative, and the frequency of testing is every three years, the rate of growth of cervical cancer is slow.  If someone has a false negative and she comes back in three years' time, is there an estimation of how advanced that cancer would have progressed in those three years?  The benefit of screening is that women are screened every three years in order that a profile of the patient is being built up.  If there is a false negative on one smear, how much of a change would be expected in a three-year period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#HHH00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I could hazard offering an answer on that.  Once a woman has a visible, invasive cervical cancer, she will probably live without treatment for about 18 to 24 months.  However, we know, and this is one of the best studied areas of screening in any part of the body, that to get to that stage there is a pre-invasive stage that may take as long as 12 or 15 years, which starts off as a mild abnormality and usually progresses at a reasonable rate to a severe abnormality and then to cancer.  At any of those stages it can revert back to being normal, but the nearer one gets to having an invasive cervical cancer, the more likely it is to progress into being an invasive cancer.  The premise of the Chairman's question is whether one has several opportunities to catch it before it becomes invasive.  The answer is one has many opportunities.  This test, which has a high false negative rate, works because one has several attempts at it over the ten or 12-year period before it turns into an invasive cancer.  If it progressed more rapidly and the test was as good as it is now, it would not work but because it progresses so slowly, this test, which has error built into it, works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#HHH00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter McKenna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":645,"content":"<p>To go back to the Deputy's question about the prediction Dr. David Gibbons made, I heard him saying that what is happening now is what he predicted.

The chief medical officer has just taken us through an explanation of why that is not what we are experiencing.  Dr. Gibbons did not predict that there would be a review process that would go so terribly wrong in terms of its communication to patients.  That review process going terribly wrong has got nothing to do with where the slides were read.  Such a review process would have had to occur wherever those slides were processed, including here, and there were such misses when the programme was based in Ireland in terms of its cytology process.  If the same flawed process of communication had occurred, we would still be here having this discussion because it is fundamentally not about an excessive level of miss, taking into account the limitations of this test.  Clearly, any miss is highly regrettable.  While we have this programme, the whole purpose is to prevent cervical cancer.  We do not take some satisfaction from the fact that the miss rate here is simply that which would normally be expected.  We would wish we had a better test, and we will move to a better test, but what Dr. Gibbons predicted is not what we are experiencing.

There will be an investigation into those facts and how they might have played out in these cases that might help to elucidate the specifics.  That goes to the heart of the question he asked earlier about the advice I gave the previous Minister for Health and now Taoiseach and gave to the current Minister which seems to be counterintuitive.  The reality is that it is complex.  In the minds of many medical practitioners, what plays into their decisions are fears over creating medical legal risk for themselves.  This may not be the reality in terms of genuine risk, but there is a perception there.  All too often when harm occurs, instead of embracing the opportunity to sit with patients and explain, sometimes the temptation on the part of practitioners is to circle the wagons, close ranks and not share information.  I could give a long list of cases where that has been at the very heart of those practices.<\/p> <p>  Without going into detail, the purpose ultimately of what is in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act is to essentially offer protections to doctors and standards on open disclosure, effectively saying that if they do it in the right way, these protections will be offered to them.  That allows us to give them reassurance and say that it is a safe and worthwhile thing to do and to encourage it.  There is a judgment at the heart of my advice around which is likely to be more effective, because we want to see disclosure happening in every case.<\/p><p>We want to encourage people to do the right thing rather than require them to do something they are unwilling to do.

I would like to give a little more detail of what the Taoiseach was talking about this morning, although in the circumstances, I do not want to spend a long time in describing it.  If we call the total 3,000 people for the purposes of discussion, whether they are part of the original 1,482 or the cohort that has to be identified, each case is to be looked at through an international process we are to establish.  We have taken steps to begin to mobilise some of that expertise.  It will require us to gain access to some of the slide materials from some of the laboratories.  It will require us to do the data matching that was described.  Any discordance, in the 208 cases we know about or any other one we might identify, will be subject to a full clinical review which will involve assessment by an international panel of experts capable of making it.  It will include a review of charts and a meeting with each of the individual patients.  Each individual woman who finds herself in this situation will have the question addressed as to the likelihood it has had an impact on either her treatment at the time of diagnosis or the eventual outcome.  In very tragic cases where people are no longer alive, for the next of kin who will such information, it will help to address some of the questions for them.<\/p> <p>  We also see some of the information in the findings of that process which will bring it to one report which will be published being made available to feed into ongoing consideration of the redress process that the Taoiseach this morning indicated that he was open to considering and to which the Government will give consideration.  We are also giving further consideration - I know that the Minister has taken steps today to engage with other parties to - to the question as to what will be the most effective investigative vehicle to bring closure to some of the items of information, in particular some of the additional items that came into the public domain last evening.  With the Minister amd as the director general said, we will receive receive daily reports from the head of the serious incident management team, SIMT, and Mr. Damien McCallion who will have operational responsibility.

Section 51 takes that slightly further, saying that so long as the processing is necessary and proportionate and also subject to suitable and specific measures, special categories of personal data, which we are going to be discussing a lot, about ethnic origin, political opinions, health, sexual orientation and so on, can be processed for research, historical and archiving purposes.  What these sections mean at the most basic level is that using someone's data without his or her consent for research or scientific purposes is allowed.  Section 58 then restricts the type of research or archiving processes.  Some of the rights that people have in regard to their own data under the GDPR, for example, may be the right to have inaccurate data about them corrected, the right to object to processing and so on.  In general, all that is fine because there are strong public interest reasons for doing research and archiving.  Certainly in the case of archiving, it may literally be impossible to get consent because the data involved may belong to somebody whose whereabouts are not known.<\/p><p>However, there is a slight concern that &quot;scientific research purposes&quot; are not defined in the Bill.  In other countries, Germany for example, there is a tradition of requiring research to be completely independent of any corporate influence in order to be considered scientific.  Independence is generally understood as the research staff having full autonomy in determining both the object of the study and the methods of inquiry.  In Germany, therefore, corporate research and analytics are unlikely to constitute &quot;scientific research&quot; within the meaning of the GDPR.<\/p><p>Our concern is that, particularly in the context of very sophisticated multinationals operating in Ireland, while we do not have this traditional understanding of scientific research, we do have a traditional deference to multinationals.  This could give rise to a broad interpretation of what &quot;scientific research&quot; constitutes.  Particularly because we are talking about the most protected types of personal data, we have to make sure this does not happen.  <\/p><p>We think this is a small amendment.  We want to make sure the data being exempted in these circumstances are being used for truly scientific purposes, in order to serve the public interest and make the world a better place.  In such cases, using data without permission is fine.  However, if data are being used with a view to manipulating us more efficiently through marketing dressed up as scientific research, I do not think it should be included.  We think it is a minor amendment but very important nonetheless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#B01400","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":874,"content":"<p>Would Deputy Wallace like to add anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#B01500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Not really.

It would not be appropriate for us here to elaborate on such a definition.  However, there is a strong likelihood that there will be guidelines from the European Data Protection Board on this precise issue.

In discussing them, I will touch on some of the more controversial issues in this area.  While my introductory remarks might be somewhat lengthy, that will not be repeated across the afternoon.  I want to raise some general points now, which will save me from making them later, because they are key.<\/p> <p>  In all the debate around the Bill, the power of the Minister to make regulations after the fact, with no Oireachtas oversight, governing the processing of personal data or special categories of data, and restricting people's data rights has probably generated the most controversy, and is much more important than the age of consent in its implications.  <\/p> <p>  At present, section 48 allows a Minister, or effectively a Department, to do the following: to designate some purpose - essentially anything - as being in the substantial public interest and make regulations allowing someone - presumably anyone - to take information about people's sexual orientation, sex life, political opinions, trade union membership and so on, as well as their genetic and biometric data and to do who knows what with it for the purpose of fulfilling some substantial public interest that we do not yet know about.<\/p><p>Section 57 proposes that the basic rights in the GDPR contained between Articles 12 to 22, and Article 34 can all be restricted for the purposes of what is called the general public interest.  Section 57 contains a list of things relating to what the general public interest might be but it is not exhaustive and any Minister can designate by regulation basically anything as being in the public interest.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to section 70 and the reason we tabled those amendments, let us look at section 48 as an example.  This section allows for the processing of special categories of data such as health, sexual orientation and so on by whichever entity the Minister decides on for reasons of public interest so it could be, for example, that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection decides it is going to create a database of people's ethnicity in order to combat fraud.  It comes up with some sort of internal policy paper that links ethnicity and social welfare fraud and relates higher levels of fraud among some ethnic groups.  The Minister then designates the prevention of social welfare fraud as being a substantial public interest and the Department comes up with regulations, gives a nod to the section, the Minister signs off and lo and behold, we have racial profiling and it is legal.  A database is created about the riskiest ethnic groups who are targeted for invasive procedures.  It might sound dramatic but that would be lawful at the moment.  <br\/><br\/>I know the Minister will tell me that the provisions in subsection 5 would protect against this but there is a problem with that.  The problem is the Irish State's record of data protection.  We know it from the public services card and the primary online database.  We know it not just from international problems but internationally.  We must put this discussion in context.  We do not have a good reputation for data protection.  In 2015, the former German federal commissioner for data protection put it bluntly when he told <i>The New York Times<\/i>why Internet businesses go to Ireland.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>Of course Facebook would go to a country with the lowest levels of data protection.  It's natural they would choose Ireland.<\/blockquote><p>We have also seen how our data retention regime has been the subject of significant legal issues going back more than ten years with Digital Rights Ireland cases; the constitutional challenge; having our data retention laws struck down in national constitutional courts in Germany, Bulgaria and Romania; the Tele2 case; and the Murray judgment.  We must look at our record in this issue because the State continues to fight on it.  Not only that, when we were presented with the Communications (Retention of Data) Bill as late as last year, it fell short of the Murray recommendations and the requirements in European law in the form of Tele2 and the European Convention on Human Rights so that is the context in which we must look at this Bill.<br\/><br\/>Our proven approach to this issue involves trundling along until we are forced by the European Court of Justice to derogate from that.  Our proposal simply says that against this backdrop, and this is what all these amendments are about and we really see them as one of the most important bits, it is necessary that the Oireachtas has some kind of rules around the processing of the most sensitive types of data because that is what we are talking about.  We need to have some democratic oversight and not a Civil Service free for all.  Therefore, our very reasonable proposal is that when a Minister wants to make regulations under section 48 allowing the processing of the most sensitive kinds of data, they must ask the House to approve it.  I do not think that is dramatic.<br\/><br\/>Our proposal in respect of section 70 is similar.  That deals with the processing of sensitive data by competent authorities and other bodies specified in law for criminal justice purposes.  The last section where we think this positive resolution procedure should apply is section 57.  I mentioned earlier that section 57 allows for the restriction of rights under Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34 for what is called the general public interest.  It lists 14 indicative objections of the general public interest.  These are investigating ethics breaches in regulated professions, identifying assets derived from crime, ensuring the effective operation of immigration and so on.  Look at the 14 objectives and in two seconds, one will be able to name the lobby group in each case which argued for the inclusion of its own objective in terms of this section.  In the case of each of the 14, the Minister is allowed under the section to make regulations restricting rights under Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34.  Under this section, any Minister is also allowed to designate new objectives as being of general public interest.  All of this restricting and designating will take place behind closed doors with no democratic oversight or accountability.  This section essentially means that Government Departments will be the judges of what rights individuals should have against them and their agencies without any need for legislation.  These are rights people have by right under European law and the GDPR.  <br\/><br\/>When we were here during pre-legislative scrutiny, the chair of Digital Rights Ireland, Dr T.J. McIntyre, put forward the idea of a positive resolution being necessary before any regulations are passed in the more controversial sections as one of the ways to mitigate against many of the wrongs in this Bill.  This is exactly what we are doing with this group of amendments.  At a previous meeting of the committee, Simon McGarr said, &quot;I do not think we should allow for an unqualified right of a Minister to provide for exemptions from European law at the stroke of a pen by way of a statutory instrument regardless of whether that is attractive to the Executive as a method of providing for regulatory activity.&quot;  Contrary to how much of the media focus has been around this Bill, this is actually one of the key provisions in it and we take it very seriously, which is why I took the extra time in making my introductory remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#C04200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":920,"content":"<p>We will be supporting the amendment in the name of Deputies Daly and Wallace.  Like Deputy Daly, I will make some points to which I will refer after the fact rather than repeat in respect of various amendments because they apply to a number of them.<\/p> <p>  One of the primary criticisms of this Bill is the length of it and the extent of the exemptions and the scope for regulation.  In a general sense, the principles of the GDPR are quite strong and represent progress in terms of data protection in Europe, although I am sure the general public is sick and tired of the GDPR, emails and so on.<\/p> <p>  This legislation has been the subject of significant criticism for a number of reasons.  At the outset, the Minister said that the GDPR generally has direct effect and that it would create problems where the Irish legislation will come into conflict with it.  I would say that the legislation as currently drafted and very likely some of the Minister's amendments are in conflict with the GDPR and there will be contradictions at the behest of the Government between the GDPR and the Data Protection Bill.  This will result in litigation, which is very problematic in itself because it will create a lack of certainty regarding data protection.<\/p> <p>  However, I would also be very concerned about the very substantial and wide discretion the Minister is being allowed in the creation of regulations.  That is the reason we put forward and had amendments passed in the Seanad about seeking impact assessments of the proposed processing of special categories of personal data.  I recognise that some progress was made regarding the qualification that it be necessary and proportionate as opposed to simply being necessary, which was the previous provision.  That is a step forward but the potential categories of exemptions are still very wide and allow the Minister too much discretion.<\/p> <p>  I made the point on Second Stage that the Bill uses the term \"public interest\" in excess of 20 times but there is no definition of public interest.  There is a definition in the GDPR.  Article 9.2(g) states that the public interest should \"respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.\"  The fact that this area is not defined in this Bill is a problem, particularly where the public interest is referred to so many times as the basis for exceptions and scope for regulation.<\/p><p> In a general sense I have a problem with the Bill's approach that something \"shall be lawful, except where...\", whereas in the GDPR the approach is that something \"shall not be lawful, except where...\"  The presumption is in the opposite direction.  I have concerns about numerous sections.  I am likely to oppose sections 37, 45 and 57 on these and other bases.<\/p><p> I will try not to repeat those points.  I thought it would be useful at the outset to outline the basis for that.  Safeguards, such as the proposed positive resolution by the Houses of the Oireachtas, are important to safeguard people's data protection rights, and to reduce the impact of the numerous exceptions and substantial discretion the legislation gives the Minister. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#D00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":922,"content":"<p>It seems clear that the Deputies are trying to draw a distinction between regulations made under sections 48, 57 and 70, and those made under other sections of the Bill.  In the case of regulations made under sections 48, 57 and 70, it is proposed that draft regulations be laid before the Houses and would not take effect until they had the approval of both Houses.  Deputy Clare Daly described it as a bit dramatic.  I do not believe that such a heavy approval procedure for regulations is justified.  We see here a proposal to depart from the accepted practice and procedure for the purposes of drafting regulations in accordance with our legislative programme.  I do not believe it is either necessary or proportionate to depart from accepted procedure.<\/p> <p>  In all cases, as is made clear by the relevant sections, the regulations will permit data processing only insofar as necessary and proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved.  I draw members' attention to the threshold we have set out clearly in sections 48(6), 57(10) and 70.  Any processing must be necessary for reasons of substantial interest.<\/p> <p>  It might be useful to look at some of the examples under the 1988 Act, which have been introduced over the years.  I refer particularly to SI 426\/2016, which was made to permit the processing of sensitive personal data by the Garda Commissioner for the purposes of assisting the Northern Ireland historical institutional abuse inquiry.  Shortly thereafter SI 427\/2016 was made to permit the processing of sensitive personal data by the Garda Commissioner for the purposes of the coroner's inquest in Northern Ireland into the death of Arlene Arkinson.  Earlier SI 240\/2015 was made to permit the processing of sensitive personal data by the Garda Commissioner in order to provide assistance to the coroner's inquest in Northern Ireland into the death of ten people at Kingsmill in County Armagh.  SI 486\/2011 was made to enable sensitive personal data to be disclosed and processed by the committee chaired by former Senator Martin McAleese to establish the facts of the State involvement in the Magdalen laundries.<\/p> <p>  Any regulations made under section 48 must be lawful, necessary and proportionate.  Adherence with these thresholds will be overseen by the Office of the Attorney General when providing legal advice, as that office does to all Departments on the matter of the drafting of the content of regulations.  In all cases the Departments concerned will be required to consult with my office and also with the data protection commission.<\/p> <p>  I believe we have sufficient safeguards.  I am not convinced that the onerous and cumbersome procedure outlined in the amendment is either necessary or justified. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#E00200","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":923,"content":"<p>The problem is that what the Minister refers to as sufficient safeguards come from the same Department.

We need to consider the time implication of an oversight role for committees or the D&aacute;il, which might be onerous.  One answer to that might be to consider setting up an Oireachtas data protection committee to scrutinise regulations made under this Act.  The UK has a digital affairs committee and Germany has a similar one.

We refer to it as being secondary legislation, but in effect any Minister when signing a statutory instrument is changing the law.  It is common in every Act that a Minister may make regulations pursuant to the purposes of the Act.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Daly's amendment is not enormously controversial.  The first part proposes that the system which operates consistently under our laws that when a regulation is introduced by a Minister by way of statutory instrument, the Oireachtas can by vote reverse that regulation if it does so by resolution within 21 days.  That feature is contained in so much legislation because it gives a legislative basis and a justification to what the Minister is doing.  I am sure if it was challenged in the courts that a Minister is making law and is not entitled to make law when, in fact, the Oireachtas is the body that makes law, the argument would be made that there is an ability within the legislation for the Oireachtas to set aside that law.  There is nothing unusual about that.  The first three parts of Deputy Daly's amendment are consistent with what operates in other legislation.<\/p> <p>  It differs in identifying in respect of sections 48, 57 and 70 a slightly different method of Oireachtas approval of any statutory instrument.<\/p><p>Oireachtas approval requires that a draft of the regulation must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and a resolution approving it must be passed by the House.  Instead of retrospective disapproval, it is prospective approval.  No matter what it is, the Oireachtas must have a role in any statutory instrument that a Minister issues.  The Oireachtas must have an ability to set it aside.  I see no difference in the Oireachtas having an ability to approve it in advance.  I listened to the contribution from the Minister.  The Minister's contention is that he is not convinced that this onerous obligation that would be placed to the Oireachtas is necessary or proportionate, that it is not justified.  I do not look at it that way.  The Oireachtas is the law-making body within the State.  The Oireachtas stands in a position of supervision over statutory instruments that are issued by a Minister.  There can be situations where there is retrospective disapproval, as exists already.  Why not put in a system of prospective approval?  I think we need to recognise something.  I am not aware of any time in the history of the State when a statutory instrument was reversed by resolution of the Oireachtas, so maybe we should be looking at a more prospective method of approval of statutory instruments.

The ability to use statutory instruments in the manner in which they have been used right across the board will actually be replaced.  We must think about the reality of what happens, which is that committee time must be found, processes must be in place and time within the Oireachtas must be found.

I merely want to assure the committee that the process is there.  Irrespective of whether at some future time the Houses of the Oireachtas decide to introduce new committees is entirely a matter for the Oireachtas.  We can see the manner in which the whole committee system has evolved in recent years.  In accordance with this piece of legislation, there will be an element of interaction between Government and committees in the normal course.  There is already a process which will involve the Oireachtas and enable it to exercise appropriate scrutiny and exercise power and authority to reject, overturn or set aside.  My difficulty here is that I believe the safeguards already enshrined in law and already included in this piece of legislation are sufficient to allow for the level of engagement that Deputy Daly and Deputy Wallace seek.  The amendment, however, seeks a positive resolution, which from time to time can be particularly onerous.  It is not necessary in the circumstances, having regard to the manner in which instruments are drawn up, agreed by Government on the advice of the Attorney General, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and dealt with here, as I am sure this committee has, within the statutory period of 21 days.

As regards the appointment of commissioners, section 15 allocates the task of making a recommendation for appointment as a commissioner to the Public Appointments Service.  Indeed, committee members will be aware that PAS acts independently of Government and is responsible for the preparation of job specifications, advertising competitions, screening applicants and assembling interview boards.<\/p><p>It is fair to say that the service discharges these tasks in a most efficient manner.

I am concerned about what would happen if the positions of the chair of the European Data Protection Board or European Data Protection Supervisor were vacant for a period.  Such vacancies would be outside our control.  Presumably, it would mean that the selection of a commissioner cannot proceed until that European position is filled.  I have the impression, which I think is fair and reasonable, that the filling of these positions may take some time because of the involvement of the various institutions of the community.  We have experience of that from the past.  The proposed subsection (10) as tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly would appear to require the Government to satisfy itself that the Public Appointments Service nominee is suitably qualified and has the necessary experience, expertise and training.  I am concerned about any undue interference or suggestion that we are revisiting the PAS process after the event.  We all know about the difficulties of perceived politicisation of these appointments.  I am not sure if this is a desirable step.  I would have a difficulty with it.  I would also add to that difficulty that it is in conflict with the GDPR in any event.  I have a problem with amendment No. 15 but I am willing to look at amendments Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive.  I will look at the overall content of section 15 but I ask members to give careful consideration to the points that I make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#G02300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":969,"content":"<p>I support the tenor and principle of all those amendments.

Such an offence shall be punishable by an administrative fine under <i>section 139<\/i>.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>There are a number of similar amendments in this group so we will have to decide on the best approach.  The intention behind each amendment is similar.  We are discussing two elements: the age of digital consent and the area of micro-targeting of children.  Children are defined in this legislation as persons under the age of 18.  The general data protection regulation, GDPR, allows for some discretion as to whether 13 or 16 is the digital age of consent.  There will be consensus on the fact that there are enormous risks and dangers in terms of the cynical professional targeting of children by corporations.  They seek to take advantage of children to sell them goods and services.  Many of these products and goods are harmful, either in general or when taken to excess.  There are huge dangers and there are many young people in particular who are not aware of the extent to which their data is being gathered, the profile that is being built up on them and the way it is being used to exploit them.  It is reasonable to say that people under the age of 18 should not be micro-targeted in this way and they should be protected from that form of advertisement, which is often very cynical and exploitative.<\/p><p>I will be supporting amendment No. 27 with some degree of hesitancy.  I take a contrary view to the Ombudsman for Children and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, with some trepidation.  It is quite a complex area and is much broader than some of the discussion we have had hitherto which has focused on the area of predatory behaviour, which is not necessarily relevant to this.  This area is focused very much on data protection and the protection of children from the exploitation and manipulation of their data.  There is also a considerable body of opinion and expertise which has outlined the manner in which children are put at risk simply by the micro-targeting and the fact that at that age they will be in a position to give their consent to the giving away of their data.<\/p><p>I am supporting the amendment, but I believe we should keep it under review on an ongoing basis.  If, as looks apparent, amendment No. 27 is carried, we need to keep a very open mind on it.  We must be conscious that it is not a silver bullet.  Some people will try to present this as an almost foolproof defence for people under the age of 16.  It is vitally important that people are under no illusions as to the fact that people under the age of 16 will still be very vulnerable online, as will the population quite generally, and that there is a need for many additional measures, including the digital safety commissioner, which I have proposed and about which I have been in contact with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I have had a Bill passed on the issue of greater education for parents and children in schools and at home.  Issues such as default privacy settings also need to be worked on.  There is no digital age of consent at the moment.  It will move from 13 to 16.  We will support the amendment, but will add a health warning on the strength of that.  I believe there is consensus on the micro-targeting aspect, and I urge the Minister to work with all the members of the committee and others outside the committee to ensure that this is done and done properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#K00700","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1024,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 27 and 30 in this grouping.  Amendment No. 27 relates to the digital age of consent, which as it stands offers very little protection to children and young people, despite the fact that Recital 38 notes that, \"Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned.\"  Article 8 of the GDPR provides very little specific protection for children.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about a matter of contractual capacity rather than child protection.  By lowering the age of consent we are setting the age far below the age we would expect young people to be capable of making informed decisions about their safety.  Instead, we are allowing them to enter into an agreement with companies, which in turn will monetise their data and online activity.  I believe most people would find that unacceptable.  By raising the age we are placing the onus on the companies to introduce more robust age verification procedures and ensuring that parents retain a right to play a role in their children's online activities, however limited that role may be.  There is a role for parents in the giving of contractual permission, and it should be retained, in my view, up to the age of 16.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the harvesting of children's data is much more important.  It is covered by amendment No. 30.  As the Minister will know, the Article 29 Working Party has clarified that the GDPR does not place an outright prohibition on the use of profiling tactics on children.<\/p><p>Recital 38 of the GDPR notes that specific protections should be put in place to protect children when their data is used for the purposes of marketing.  Despite this, neither recital materially affects the text of Articles 8 or 22.  We believe this is a significant failing of the GDPR, which should be addressed through our own domestic legislation.  <br\/><br\/>The amendment that I have tabled today aims to achieve the same outcome as those submitted by Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire, Clare Daly and Wallace.  However, Deputy Catherine Murphy and I have chosen to specifically prohibit profiling activity rather than all processing of data to ensure the scope of the amendment is tightly focused.  I am not sure how practical it is to talk about prohibiting the processing of data.  The other amendments in this regard talk about the processing of data.  Data is processed for lots of different reasons and, therefore, there is a need to be more specific, in terms of this legislation, in outlawing the profiling for specific marketing and commercial purposes.  That is what this amendment seeks to do.<br\/><br\/>It is noteworthy that in replies to parliamentary questions that the Minister has consistently stated that the Children's Rights Alliance favours setting the digital age of consent at 13.  The group has called for the age limit to be introduced in conjunction with the statutory prohibition on the use of children's data for marketing purposes, which is an important point.  We may argue about whether the digital age of consent should be set at 13 or 16 years of age but the more important issue is whether companies can target children's data for the purposes of marketing.  The Children's Rights Alliance has been very clear about the matter.  It believes that there needs to be a statutory prohibition on the use of children's data in this way.  I note that this morning the Ombudsman for Children, Mr. Niall Muldoon, in an interview on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; made exactly the same point.  He argued for the age of consent to be set at 13 years but he said that the profiling of children and harvesting of their data for commercial purposes should be prohibited on a statutory basis.<br\/><br\/>I draw attention to the fact that the Irish Heart Foundation has called for a ban on the marketing of junk food to children to address the wholly inappropriate level of access, which online companies have through their media platforms.  Last month, Mr. Chris Macey attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  On that occasion he made a very strong plea when he said:  <\/p><blockquote>Junk food brands have achieved a wholly inappropriate proximity to children, pestering them relentlessly in school, at home and even in their bedrooms through their smart phones.  It is called &quot;brand in the hand&quot; and it gives marketers constant access to children.  Junk food marketing involves the world's best marketing brains in the biggest agencies relentlessly targeting children every single day.  The damaging impact of overselling their products has created a market failure that the State must resolve.  We know voluntary codes do not work.  Sadly, the State's response has been feeble to date. <\/blockquote><p>The Irish Heart Foundation has a specific concern about the relentless targeting of children for the promotion of junk funds.  However, many brands and products are promoted.  I think that the vast majority of people find it repugnant that online companies can target children in this manner.  It is for that reason that the amendment proposes to outlaw the harvesting of children's data up to the age of 18.  <br\/><br\/>The GDPR acknowledged that this sort of marketing is a real issue.  In light of the text of Recitals 38 and 71, I believe that this amendment is fully in line with the intent of the GDPR and would significantly strengthen child protection measures in this Bill.  I urge the Minister to support my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#K00800","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>I have one amendment in this grouping and it is amendment is No. 27.  Similarly to Deputy Shortall, my amendment seeks to change the age of digital consent from 13 years of age to 16 years of age.<\/p> <p>  As we are all aware, under the GDPR each country is given leeway as to what age it wishes to set the digital age of consent.  Let us remember that it can be between 13 years and 16 years.  There are arguments on both sides.  Fianna F&aacute;il has come down, on balance, in favour of setting the digital age of consent at 16 years.  I shall give an overview as to the party's thinking on the matter.  Obviously the Internet provides children with very many great benefits.  It provides them with benefits in terms of their ability to access information.  Even by using applications, or apps, it provides great advantages to children and helps them to keep in touch with groups such as football teams and allows them  to co-ordinate their communication online.  It is very beneficial.<\/p> <p>  The Internet also has very negative consequences such as children obsessively using the Internet and mobile phones.  These are issues that go beyond the parameters of what is contained within the Bill that is before this committee today.  We must recognise the fact that children are growing up exposed to levels of intrusion and information that none of us here was exposed to when we were growing up.  There is a huge responsibility on parents when it comes to their children accessing information on the Internet and their use of social media apps.  There is also a responsibility on legislators.  We can play some role in respect of that and the digital age of consent in this legislation.<\/p> <p>  The premise from which we need to start is that generally in law a child cannot enter a contract until he or she reaches the age of 18, which is the age at which he or she is no longer a child.  In certain instances children can enter a contract such as to purchase life's necessities, buy food in shops and similar issues.  In general, the principal is that children cannot enter into contracts until they are 18 years of age.  <\/p> <p>  Section 30 refers to what age children can consent to giving access to their data.  The view of Fianna F&aacute;il is that 13 years of age is too young and the age of consent should be increased to 16 years of age.  The reason is that we want to ensure that children are protected from data profiling and commercial targeting.  What happens, as we can now see from our increased knowledge of large social media companies, is that individuals are commodified into groups and that information then becomes something which is marketable.  An individual is not marketable but an individual who is part of a larger group is a commodity because that group is a commodity and, therefore, can be used for the purpose of generating commercial gain for that social media company.  <\/p> <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that we should put further obligations on the social media companies to ensure that when children consent that there is an understanding as to what they are consenting to.  It is difficult for children of 13 years of age to recognise the extent to which they are consenting.  <\/p> <p>  One of the problems with people's interaction with social media, and social media apps online, is that sometimes when one first joins one's status is frozen from that time onwards.  So a person joins at a young naive age and he or she may have particular interests or objectives in terms of online searches.  That information can sometimes be frozen within a social media company and the child is presented as somebody who is always of these views.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest dangers we have from social media in general is the threat it poses to individualism.  As I said in the D&aacute;il about two weeks ago, the objective of social media is to put people into groups and then people think that they must think in accordance with what their group believes as opposed to what their individual thoughts are.  Sometimes people have different views in respect of people with whom they have similar thoughts on other matters.  Unfortunately, the weakness of this commodification of individuals into groups is that there is a tendency to merge people into groups thus generating groupthink.  I also think this practice is anti-intellectual in the long run.<\/p><p>I am sure members will legitimately turn around and say that Deputy O'Callaghan was a member of this committee, as was Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, that produced a pre-legislative report on the Data Protection Bill, which raised without demur or objection that the digital age of consent should be set at 13 years.  That is correct, we did do that.  <\/p><p> When I am dealing with issues on a committee basis, I am not running back up to the fourth floor to the Fianna F&aacute;il offices to find out the Fianna F&aacute;il view on this.  Deputy Chambers and I are Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies but we are working as part of the committee.  At a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il Front Bench we had a very thorough and detailed engagement on this issue and there is genuine concern that not enough is being done to protect children who are accessing information online.  It was thought that the least we could do is to try to put more of the obligation on social media companies as opposed to on the parents and on the individual child and set the digital age of consent at 16 years.  For that reason, I will be pressing amendment No. 27.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#L00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan.

We will be supporting the Government's section 30 which sets the age of consent of child in relation to information society services at 13 years of age.  We think this is the right way forward.  We, as were all the committee members, very impressed by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon when he appeared before the committee.  Let me remind people of what he said at that meeting.  He said that Ireland should take the opportunity now to designate the lowest permissible age, namely 13, as the age of digital consent for this jurisdiction.  This lower digital age of consent has also been recommended by children's organisations, such as the Children's Rights Alliance.<\/p> <p>  He also said that prior to the committee he took the opportunity to discuss the issue with the Ombudsman for Children who supports his view that the age of digital consent should be set at 13 years of age.  I know that Deputy Shortall has raised points around that but members will see from amendment No. 29 in the names of Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace that we have dealt with the harvesting of children's data, which has been raised.<\/p> <p>  A variety of competing children's rights and practical realities support the argument that the appropriate age, having regard to the permissible age range delineated by the GDPR, should be the lowest age possible.  He went on to say that the right of the child to participate and be heard in proceedings concerning him or her is a fundamental principle of international children's rights law and is enshrined by Article 12 of UN convention on the rights of the child. and in Article 24 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  He states that the importance of the voice of the child and the child's right to participate in all matters have been promoted recently in this jurisdiction when the Irish people voted in a referendum on children's rights, which must mean something.  He also states that freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are very important.  The right to freedom of expression is a human right that is not confined in its remit to adults.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC guarantees a child's enjoyment of freedom of expression in Article 13.  Further related rights under the UNCRC include the right to access appropriate information provided in Article 17 and the freedom to assemble peacefully, such assembly may take place in the context of an online environment.  We need to realise that the world has changed and that these basic human rights are as relevant in the online world as they are in the world to which we are accustomed.  That needs to be acknowledged in our legislation.  These rights are often exercised by children through their use of information and communication technology.  <\/p> <p>  We have tabled three amendments to this section.  Our amendment No. 28 proposes that Tusla maintains a register of preventative or counselling services for the purposes of section 30 of the Bill.  There is a later related amendment, No. 246, to amend section 8(1) of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.<\/p> <p>  Section 30 relates to the consent of a child in relation to information society services, which is clearly a positive thing.  Information society services are essentially online shops, live or on-demand streaming services such as Netflix or Spotify that need to be paid for.  So-called preventative or counselling services are exempted here, these might include Childline, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children or groups that offer advice to children about mental health or drug or alcohol abuse.  Under the GPDR, data controllers do not need to get the consent of parents or guardians when they are processing a child's data, when that data is related to preventative or counselling services offered directly to the child.  This amendment is proposing that to prevent abuse of this exemption, Tusla should maintain a register of such preventative or counselling services to safeguard against abuse of the exemption.  One concern in the Bill is that it does not provide a definition of preventative or counselling services.  Is it safe therefore not to have a register of such services?  The amendments that we are proposing, that Tusla maintains a register of these services, seems like a sensible provision.<\/p> <p>  In amendment No. 29, in the name of Deputy Claire Daly and Wallace, which is similar to amendments tabled by other Deputies, we are repeating the wording of an amendment tabled by Senator Lynn Ruane in the Seanad.  I respect and accept the opinion of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon on setting the digital age of consent at 13 years and I think the age of consent should remain at 13 years, as stated in the Bill.  I understand and appreciate some of the arguments for raising the digital age of consent to closer to 16 years, that certain Senators and Deputies have made, however, including a prohibition on profiling and direct marketing to children under 16 years would surely go a long way to addressing the fears that people have on the digital age of consent being set at 13 years.  This is not an unreasonable request.  It should not be possible and legal to track a child's progress online and be able to create a detailed digital profile of that child and then specifically micro target him or her based on the profile created.  This kind of digital marketing is incredibly powerful and it would surely be a progressive step to shield children from it.  The parents of Ireland would thank us for doing that.<\/p> <p>  In the second part of amendment No. 29, we propose to insert a new subsectrion (4).  This adheres to Senator Ruane's Seanad amendment and is a reasonable attempt to protect parents being profiled and targeted via their children's online activity, though arguably Articles 6 and 9 of the GDPR prohibits this kind of profiling.  Will the Minister clarify that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#M00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak on amendment No. 27.  WhatsApp is going to ask new users to confirm that they are aged 16 years, Facebook will ask children between 13 years and 15 years to nominate a parent or guardian to grant permission, children who do not have parental permission for Facebook will see a generic version of Facebook that is not customised, based on their personal data.  This shows that children will continue to have access to the Internet, but their data will not be exploited.  Setting the digital age at 16 years will not mean that a 13 year old cannot use Facebook, which I am using as an example, however, it will mean that Facebook cannot use the 13 year old.  The child will be protected from targeted advertising derived from personal data.  This is not so different from the rules placing a ban on advertisements targeted at children in the offline world, including broadcasting.  The point is that while people may make the argument that no matter whether the age of digital consent is set at 13 years or 16 years, the technology is not yet available to check age verification at this stage and that a young person of 13 years could pretend to be older.<\/p><p>We are putting an onus on social media companies to ensure they are adhering to a clear legal guideline; they are not allowed to exploit the data of somebody within that age cohort for commercial purposes.  That is the protection we are seeking to put in place.  <\/p><p> We all agree with the arguments of prominent people like Dr. Geoffrey Shannon on the issue of child protection.  One could argue that the drafters of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child could not possibly have foreseen companies like Facebook and WhatsApp, commercial companies that can exploit children and use their information.  They can use their name, address and date of birth and geotag them; they know exactly where they are and have access to all of their photographs.  They can use that information for nefarious purposes and most definitely drive their bottom line.<\/p><p> What we are seeking to do in putting forward this amendment is to keep in line with many other European countries who are also in this space.  Those states are interpreting the regulation from the European Union.  We are also seeking to ensure we do not have a situation where children aged 13 to 16 years are being exploited and their information is being used to commercial advantage.  We wish to put the onus back on social media companies.  I repeat that WhatsApp and Facebook have already announced their intention to adopt a uniform approach in line with that taken in other European countries in how they use data.  They are putting protocols in place to that effect.  I, therefore, ask the Government to accept a digital age of consent of 16 years on the basis that the market seems to be moving in that direction.  Social media companies are moving it way and we should not be behind the curve in how we interpret the regulation.  We should at least be on it, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#M00400","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1032,"content":"<p>This is a group of amendments that has attracted a lot of interest.  In some ways, that is disappointing.  Issues are being conflated.  To me, the concentration on the digital age of consent is a little like focusing on a fly on the wall when there is a giant elephant in the room about which no one is even talking.  All of the other provisions in the Bill are of far greater consequence.  Setting the digital age of consent at 13 years is not going to do what some Deputies fear it is going to do.  For example, in response to the last speaker's points about Facebook, I note that this is a proposal that has already been made by it.  The Oireachtas setting the digital age of consent at 13 years will have absolutely no bearing on it whatsoever, whereas our protective measures regarding micro-targeting in amendment No. 29 would cover that point.  we are conflating issues incorrectly.<\/p><p>It would be very remiss of us not to take the advice of people like Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the Ombudsman for Children and all of the children's rights organisations which have stated very clearly that the digital age of consent should be set at 13 years.  We fully support that advice.  It is separate from the other measures and I will park that issue.  I will not repeat points made on it.  Deputy Mick Wallace is right.  Not dealing with it is a little like the old approach to under-age sex - just do not do it - rather than the modern thinking that providing progressive sex education is better.  This is the same.  Educating young people and putting the onus on providers is a far better way forward.  Setting the age at 16 years seems good.  It sounds like a protective measure but actually it is not.  As has been pointed out, it subjects young people to abusive parents, for example.  It puts another responsibility on parents with which, in many instances, they may not be capable of dealing.  The onus should be put on service providers.  That is what our other amendment tries to do.<\/p><p>I will address some of the simpler amendments first just to get them out of the way.  I refer to amendment No. 28.  As Deputy Mick Wallace said, we know that the general data protection regulation, GDPR, exempts preventive and counselling services from the general provisions on the digital age of consent.  In other words, children under the digital age of consent will be allowed to access these services without parental consent.  The question is how they are identified.  My fear is that a register would be needed.  In the absence of a register services could deny services to a child under the digital age of consent to be on the safe side.  It might be a service a child needs.  In the worst case scenario a service could be taken to court by an abusive parent who finds out that his or her child has been using the service and decides to take revenge by burying it in litigation.  Good services that are helping children should not be targeted in that way.  We think Tusla is best placed to draw up such a register.  It would not be an onerous job for it to do so.  It should be quite easy for it.  That would be a helpful measure and require minimal work.<\/p><p>I will also address amendment No. 29 which concerns the issue of protecting children, in common with amendment No. 28 in the name of Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, amendment No. 30 in the name of the Social Democrats and amendment No. 34 in the name of the Minister, about which I would like to make a few points.  This is about the micro-targeting of children.  I have a slight concern that amendment No. 26 in the name of Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire might be a littletoo narrow and difficult to enforce.  It is a little like the argument about the prohibition in civil legislation on groups accepting donations that the donors intend to be used for political purposes.  Historically, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has found it impossible to enforce and has said so repeatedly.  It is hard to prove a reason someone is collecting data.  The amendment really just states they cannot use the data for marketing purposes.  I am open to arguments, but we have a concern about Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire's wording and think ours is better.  However, clearly the intention behind the two is the same.  The Social Democrats' amendment is also a little similar, but I do not see the necessity of using the word &quot;profile&quot;.  The word &quot;process&quot; is just fine and captures everything it needs to do.  Again, I think that amendment might be slightly narrow.<\/p><p>The Minister's amendment is about the idea of preventing children from being targeted in marketing.  He is proposing a code of conduct which the commission will encourage companies to draw up.  It is not bad, but our amendment is stronger.  However, I am open to being persuaded.  The second part of the amendment, with which Deputy Mick Wallace dealt, needs less explanation.  It sets the digital age of consent at 13 years and requires parents to engage with companies and give their consent for their child to access services online.  The <i>quid pro quo <\/i>must be the assurance that their data will not be harvested for something like marketing, profiling or whatever else.  I know that issue is generally covered under the GDPR, but there would not be any harm in making it explicit.  I will not repeat the points made by Deputy Mick Wallace, but we are taking on board the amendments brought forward by Senator Lynn Ruane in the Seanad.  They strike a better balance in protecting children in their Internet usage.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#N00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>I will not repeat points made by Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly.  However, as a committee member, it is appropriate to state we did work on this issue as a committee.  There is a process in which committees engage.  It is a vital part of drafting and putting together the approach to be taken to legislation.  We looked at the issue; brought people in and listened to them and made a judgment, particularly with reference to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's contribution.  The judgement was well thought out and made having listened to experts give voice to all sides to the argument.  It is not easy to make up one's mind on this issue.  It is regrettable, having gone through that process and looked at the issue as a committee and made our decision, that it is now being revisited.<\/p><p>I still believe the age should be 13, for the reasons that have been outlined and for the reasons the committee originally supported.  It is sometimes easy for politicians of all parties and none to see something that looks like a very acceptable and widely supported political solution.  However, we have to look at the realities of the situation and find a workable solution, one that I fundamentally believe is in the best interests of the protection of children.  We must ensure the proper use of data, control it and not have it used for exploitative purposes.  It seems to me that moving the age of digital consent from 13 to 16 is just choosing the easy option, the option that sounds good and which has gained much credibility because people who have not had the opportunity to look at the issue in the same level of detail have moved their position to it.  If I had not sat at this committee and looked into the issue, and if I did not have the benefit of hearing from the Ombudsman for Children and reading that report I might have thought that the idea of moving the digital age of consent to 16 was the right idea.  Having gone into at length in this committee, I am firmly of the belief that the best solution is that the digital age of consent should be set at 13.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#N00300","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1035,"content":"<p>I listened with great interest to the various contributions of committee members on the current group of nine amendments, including amendments to sections 30 and 31 and a proposed new section, all of which are concerned with the protection of children.  Indeed, for that reason we are discussing these amendments as a group.  Notwithstanding that, it would be helpful, having regard to the discussion we have had, if I dealt with each amendment separately, commencing with amendment No. 27, tabled by Deputies Sherlock, Shortall, O'Callaghan and Catherine Murphy, proposing a digital age of consent of 16 years in section 30.<\/p> <p>  The position, of course, is that article 8 of the GDPR specifies a digital age of consent of 16 but allows member states to provide for a lower age not below 13.  Article 8 will mean that providers of information society services must make reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the holder of parental responsibility over the child where such services are offered directly to children below the specified age threshold.  I acknowledge the extent and the importance of the discussion we had in the Seanad and elsewhere over the past year or more.  I am quite satisfied that there are sincere and strongly held views in favour of both 13 years, as provided for in the Bill, and 16 years, which is the subject matter of amendments.  <\/p> <p>  I want to talk about process here, and acknowledge the importance of the public consultation process that took place before any decision was taken by Government on this issue.  I believe that is how legislation should be processed.  Indeed, following completion of these consultations carried out by my Department on the Government's data forum, which brings together legal and data protection experts, business representatives, small and medium sized industry, multinationals, sociologists, psychologists and education specialists, the Government decided in favour of a digital age of consent of 13 years.  I want to stress that full account was taken of the knowledge of those that responded to the consultation process in reaching the decision, and a careful consideration was given to the expertise of this body of opinion.  A majority of respondents, including the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, the ISPCC, the Internet Safety Advisory Committee and the Childrens' Rights Alliance clearly recommended a digital age of consent of 13 years.  Moreover, as Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly in particular mentioned, this committee will recall the contribution of the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, who recommended a digital age of consent of 13.  That strong recommendation was adopted by the Joint Committee in this room in the Chair's report of last November.  I acknowledge the work of that committee.  The content of that committee report, and indeed the disposition of committee members, was very much considered in the context of the Government's decision here.  I was keen, at all times, that the views of this committee would be taken into consideration in my deliberation with Government colleagues. <\/p> <p>  Having regard to the due process, the Government considers that a digital age of consent of 13 years does represent an appropriate balancing of the child's right to participation in the online environment and the child's right to safety and protection.  These rights are enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In making that decision, and in choosing the age of 13, Ireland is not out of line with many other EU states.  The age of 13 has been adopted by Denmark, Sweden and Finland.  These are member states that we often look to as an example of good practice in the area of child protection and child and family support.  I can also point to other countries which have opted for the age of 13, including our nearest neighbour, the UK, Spain and Latvia.  As we are deliberating here and processing this legislation, other countries are having the same debate.<\/p> <p>  For many reasons, I am unable to accept amendment No. 27, which seeks to replace 13 with 16.  I was struck by the contribution of some Deputies here who said they were reluctantly supporting the amendment or that they were doing so with a health warning.  I am not sure that represents good practice, and I am concerned that in many respects there is a move to depart from or abandon what was a programme of good process.  I welcomed the discussion in the Seanad and proposed the inclusion of subsection 3 which provides for the review of the operation of the 13 year old threshold within three years.  I put that forward to the members here who have indicated that they are conflicted.  Article 8(3) of the GDPR provides that the providers of information society services must make reasonable efforts to verify that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental authority, specifying that available technology must be taken into consideration by the controller, and that it is highly likely that the European Data Protection Board will issue further guidelines in this matter and move towards the identification of best practice, as it is entitled to under article 70.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of difficulties with amendments Nos. 28 and 246, in which Deputies Daly and Wallace seek to impose an obligation on Tusla to maintain a register of preventative counselling services.  The services referred to here are not only those established in this State, so there is no good reason for it.  A teenager in a Border county may well be using a counselling service in Northern Ireland; I am sure the Chair can relate to that example.  Likewise, there is no good reason to prevent a teenager in Dublin or in any part of Ireland whose native language may be Polish, Lithuanian or any language other than English from taking advantage of a counselling service based in other countries.<\/p><p>We need to acknowledge the practical manifestation of everyday living, the freedom of movement and the fluidity or social mobility in society.  The amendment seeks, in effect, to define the scope of the preventative and counselling services referred to in Article 8 of GDPR, which I am afraid would amount to an infringement of GDPR.  As I said earlier, we will need to exercise great care in departing from the import of the GDPR itself.<\/p><p> I will briefly turn to children&rsquo;s personal data - amendments Nos. 26, 29 and 30, tabled by Deputies Clare Daly, Wallace, Shortall, Murphy and &Oacute; Laoghaire, seeking to impose prohibitions on the processing of children's personal data for marketing and for profiling purposes.  I have a difficulty with the amendments.  Processing personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called legitimate interests ground in Article 6.1.(f) of GDPR.  Recital 47 states specifically that the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.  It is important to note in that regard that the European Court of Justice addressed the issue of whether national law can impose additional conditions on processing carried on under the corresponding Article 7. (f) of the 1995 directive.  In that regard the Court of Justice underlined the importance of free movement of personal data under the 1995 regime.  It concluded that member states were not in a position to add new principles or impose additional conditions to have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds in Article 7 of the directive.  Those grounds are now in Article 6.1.(f) of GDPR.  In short, the imposition of prohibitions or limitations in national law on the processing of personal data that is lawful under GDPR is in breach of EU law and that could well have a consequence of exposing the State to infringement proceedings or possible sanctions of a type that we are familiar with.<\/p><p> I wish to go back to the Seanad debate because I think it is very important and informative for what we are doing here.  Mention was made by Deputy Wallace of the contribution of Senator Lynn Ruane.  It was a very strong contribution.  I agree with Deputy Wallace in that regard.  Senator Ruane was speaking not only as a Senator but as a mother of teenage children and as somebody who has engaged in children's issues to a very positive extent since she was elected to the Seanad.  During the course of the Seanad debate one could see how her positioning evolved in the context of her own practical experience.  That was really important.  She was very helpful and very positive, as indeed were other Senators.  I introduced a new section 31 in the Seanad, which makes specific provision for codes of conduct for the protection of children and I now propose amendments Nos. 32, 33 and 34 in response to Second Stage discussions here, including what was a constructive contribution from Deputy Shortall who joins us this morning.  Those amendments introduce protection for children where there is processing of their personal data for the purposes of direct marketing and creating personality and user profiles.  I think that is positive and I believe it meets the concern of Deputies.  I thank Deputy Shortall for a positive contribution in that regard.<\/p><p> In order to remain compliant with Article 40 of GDPR, section 31 does place an obligation on the supervisory authorities such as the Data Protection Commission to encourage the drawing up of codes of practice.  I listened carefully to Deputy Clare Deputy in that regard and I am conscious of her amendment but placing a specific obligation on the commission to draw up such codes would be in conflict with GDPR compliance.  The conflict would arise because of the obligation placed on the commission under Article 40.5 to provide an opinion on such a code and to approve it where it finds the code provides sufficient safeguards.  If the code is intended to apply in other member states the commission will submit it to the consistency mechanism for approval then by all member states.  I think that is what will happen.  In that regard I am unable to accept the proposals from Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace as far as amendment No. 31 is concerned, to replace \"encourage\" with \"require\" but I very much acknowledge the points Deputy Clare Daly made and I am in agreement with the overall point she made, but there is a limit to how we can mandate the supervisory authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#O00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1037,"content":"<p>I shall briefly give my views on the other amendments because I do not think I did when I spoke earlier.  In respect of amendment No. 26 in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, it is a bit vague to put in a reference to \"for the purposes of financial gain\" so I will not support the amendment.  In respect of amendment No. 28, which is proposed by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace which would limit the counselling services to those maintained on a register of Tusla, I listened to the Minister and I think he made some very valid points to the effect that Tusla could have names which do not extend outside of the jurisdiction.  Because of what the Minister said I will not support amendment No. 28.  In terms of amendment No. 29, my inclination was to support that but the Minister has now said that if we introduce it we will be in breach of European law because it goes beyond what is contained within the GDPR, and that it would expose Ireland to enforcement proceedings.  If a Minister says that to me and that is the advice of the Department and that is the legal advice he has received, I am afraid I have to responsibly listen to that as I do not want to expose the country to enforcement proceedings which may arise.  The same argument was made by the Minister in respect of amendment No. 31, in terms of changing the wording from \"encourage\" to \"require\".<\/p> <p>  In terms of the amendment to change the digital age of consent from 13 years to 16 years, I listened very carefully to the contributions and ultimately it is a political choice.  We have very limited powers to a certain extent when we are bringing in the GDPR but we do have the power to determine whether we set the age at 13 or as much as 16.  That is a political choice.  I have not heard any real argument here today as to why the capacity of children to contract should be changed in such a fundamental way whereby now they will have the capacity to contract in respect of their personal data at the age of 13.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#P00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1038,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall and then Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#P00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1039,"content":"<p>I wish to come back on a couple of points.  First, on the age of consent, there are two reasons I proposed to raise that to 16.  The first is in respect of contract law.  The minimum age for participation in a contract is 16.  Equally, the age to give consent for a medical procedure is 16, and it makes sense to bring it into line with that.  Whether it is 13 or 16 I do not think people should be lulled into any false sense of security here in relation to the safety of children on the Internet.  The difficulty many people have with the actions of online companies is that kind of relentless targeting of children, the harvesting of their data, the profiling of children and their families and then targeting them for commercial or marketing purposes.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has not given his own opinion on whether he believes that is an acceptable practice.  We know that it is happening on a widespread basis at the moment.  What is his view on that?  Does he think it is acceptable that our children are subjected to that kind of marketing?  Neither did the Minister respond to the issue I raised earlier on the age of consent although he quoted the Children's Rights Alliance and the children's Ombudsman in respect of the age of consent.<\/p><p>The Minister has not responded on the more important issue, the need to introduce, in conjunction with this, a statutory prohibition on the use of children's data for marketing purposes.  What is his response to the statement made by both bodies?<\/p><p> I expressed the view that the amendments from Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly were too wide insofar as there were issues related to market research, legitimate activities in that respect and demographic analysis of activities online.  They are legitimate activities.  For that reason, I would be more in favour of a prohibition on the profiling of children's data.  That is in line with Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment.  <\/p><p> The Minister talked about encouraging voluntary codes of conduct.  We know that voluntary codes of conduct do not work with online companies and that they have only taken action where they have been found to be doing something that they should not be doing.  We also know that originally in the general data protection regulation, GDPR, prohibiting the profiling of children's data was raised.  We also know that there was much pressure exerted by online companies and it continues.  I have been contacted by companies, as I am sure others have.  Online and digital companies do not want a prohibition on the profiling of children's data.  They want to have a free hand to harvest children's data and use them for their own commercial purposes such as direct marketing.  Most people find this unacceptable and the Minister has not provided a strong case for not prohibiting that practice.  Let us forget about voluntary codes of conduct and encouraging companies.  It will only happen if companies are precluded by domestic law from engaging in this practice.  We have an opportunity to do so to protect childhood from the relentless targeting that happens for marketing purposes.<\/p><p> This is a much more significant issue than the digital age of consent and many recognised bodies are calling for it to happen.  Children deserve to be allowed to live their childhood without their data being used for marketing purposes.  The Minister should heed what is being stated by the Children's Rights Alliance, the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Heart Foundation and many other organisations that have children's interests to the fore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#P00400","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1041,"content":"<p>Three of the amendments are relatively similar.  I will echo the point made by Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, that the right call is being made about the digital age of consent.  A great deal more is needed to ensure the safety online of children and the population at large which I have said in passing as it is not just children who are at risk online.  There are advantages and disadvantages for us all.  We all need to be more careful online, as well as enjoying the benefits of the online experience.  <\/p> <p>  Three amendments deal with micro-targeting and data harvesting for the purposes of targeting young people.  It is a vitally important and massive issue and it is welcome that the Minister has moved towards improving the obligation to have codes of conduct in that respect.  There is a general issue about children on which we are all in agreement, that there is a need to ensure this exploitation and cynical targeting is brought to an end and that it will be an offence to engage in it.  As I said, there are disadvantages and advantages for all of us and they need to be refined on Report Stage.  It would probably be better to focus on profiling, but I take the point made about engaging in such practices for the purposes of financial gain.  I will press my amendment and will support the others.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has outlined the conflict with the GDPR which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has accepted to a large extent.  Everyone has to take serious cognisance of the possibility of fines or regulatory action by the European Union.  We have to take that issue seriously, but it is not enough to flag it in general.  It is not clear to me how it could be in conflict with the GDPR.  There are areas in which the legislation is in conflict with the GDPR where ostensibly they provide for very similar provisions, but there are differences in wording.  As I said, there are conflicts in that regard and I will oppose sections on that basis.  I do not see anywhere where it is stated in the GDPR that states cannot make an offence the profiling of children's data and create fines.  There is nothing in the principles, letter or recitals of the GDPR that makes it apparent to me that there would be a problem in doing so.  If there would be, we need some further detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Q00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>I received some correspondence yesterday from a Dr. James O'Higgins Norman, associate professor of sociology at Dublin City University, DCU.  He says that as an international and Irish academic working in the field of child Internet safety with an holistic knowledge and understanding of how children engage online, he firmlys believe setting the age of digital consent at 13 years offers the best defence for children's safety and data protection.  He says calls for the age to be set higher, at 16 years, for example, are misguided and not endorsed by child protection professionals and those working with children.  He says that, under such a system, children aged 13, 14 and 15 years would need parental consent to allow their personal data to be processed by this information society service and that, all the while, there is a general acceptance that current systems of age verification are weak and generally easy to bypass.  He asks what unintended safety and protection consequences this will this have, saying attempting to change the behaviour of 13, 14 and 15 year olds by 25 May is not practical.  He says the Internet and being online are a fundamental part of most children's lives today and that, to support children's safety, they need digital literacy education, that parents need support and the industry needs to be regulated.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire made a point about amendment No. 29.  I accept the points the Minister made about amendment No. 28, at which we will have to look again with reference to the register maintained by Tusla.  On amendment No. 29, the Minister said that if we were to go down that path, we would contravene the GDPR.  We do not know enough about it to know whether that is definitely true, but we will have to examine it because we believe it would be a positive move to have amendment No. 29 in the Statute Book.  It would make sense.  It is disappointing if the GDPR has moved away, under pressure, from this position, but we will certainly look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Q00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 28, I know that the issue of the maintenance of a register was discussed in the Seanad.  The Minister made some good points about the limitations of our proposal.  We thought it was an alternative in dealing with the limitations mentioned in the Seanad about the Data Protection Commissioner being the person to maintain a register.  That proposal was shot down on the grounds that the commissioner might not have the expertise to do so.  Children being able to access relevant and important preventive and counselling services without parental consent is important, particularly for vulnerable children in cases where the parent is the abuser.  We have to take this into account because, in that context, if we do not define what they are and have a register, a devious, abusive parent could come down heavily on a service provider or a child might not be able to access information that would otherwise be useful.<\/p><p>Will the Minister have a look at this?  Is there another way we can come up with some type of register that would give protection to children?  We will withdraw the amendment for now but I call on the Minister to look at that aspect of it.<\/p><p> Deputy Shortall made a point about profiling and processing with regard to our amendment.  We have to be clear on this point.  The word \"profiling\" has a particular definition under the general data protection regulation, as distinct from processing.  In particular, \"processing\" is the word used for analysing, that is to say, using data for a particular process.  In other words, we use processes in order to profile rather than starting with profiling.  That is why it is important that the word \"process\" is used.  It is for legal reasons and it gives far greater protection in that regard.<\/p><p> We have proposed amendment No. 29.  I am unsure about the level of protection of rights under the GDPR.  The regulation refers to the rules being equivalent and an obligation on member states to apply rules consistently.  I am unsure.  We cannot state categorically that what we have put forward will guarantee that the legislation goes beyond the GDPR.  Certainly, there is a risk that it could possibly so do.  If it were too onerous, some companies could say it does, but there is no guarantee that it will.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point is a little rich because the Government is taking far greater risks with things that are clearly not compatible with the GDPR, but he does not have a problem with them.  Yet, now he is saying that this measure goes beyond it.  That does not really wash with me.<\/p><p> People are confusing different issues.  Deputy Wallace read out a letter.  The key point for the committee to register is that these 13 experts and organisations have circulated their views online.  It is almost unprecedented.  The Ombudsman for Children said that we are making a mistake.  People are conflating issues rather than understanding them.  Deputy Sherlock comments represented the best example.  It is a pity he is not here because I would have no problem saying it to his face.  What he was proposing and looking for simply does not add up.  He talked about WhatsApp going to 16 years.  That simply makes what we are proposing, a digital age of consent, easier to maintain.  It has nothing to do with it.  The last line in the letter from the experts refers to how the digital age of consent is a data protection issue and not a child safety issue.  Using data protection law to achieve an online safety effect is misguided.  Almost every expert in the area of child protection is saying as much and we cannot be blind to that.<\/p><p> This goes back to the point I made earlier.  The other example given by Deputy Sherlock is utterly ludicrous and irrelevant.  Facebook has begun to make a change for people under 16 years.  That is exactly what we should be encouraging.  Setting the age of consent at 13 years is irrelevant for those purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Q00900","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>Deputy Daly referred to the GDPR and the manner in which we might consider departing from it.<\/p><p>Article 47 states clearly that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carrying out processing for illegitimate interest.

It is not my legal advice or the advice of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I wish to state for the benefit of the committee member that we engaged on the issue raised by Deputy O'Callaghan with the Office of the Attorney General.  The advice appeared clear.  I am reluctant, therefore, to depart from the advice of the Attorney General.<\/p><p>I wish to address the amendments referred to by Deputies Daly and Wallace.  I too have the letter that both Deputies referenced.  There is considerable drawing down on expert opinion, experts and the status and influence of experts.  I do not disagree with any of the points that have been raised.  One of the signatures of the letter is Professor Mona O'Moore, who would be known to members of the committee.  She has years of experience in the area of children's issues.<\/p><p>I accept the fact that there are differing views.  I am keen to acknowledge the importance of the process and the report of the committee, wherein you stated, Chairman, in the foreword:<\/p><blockquote>The General Data Protection Regulation will grant significant rights to all citizens in Ireland, but will provide particular protections to children. The Committee has recommended that an appropriate digital age of consent for children is set, and that this age be reviewed as technology evolves.<\/blockquote> <p>This is exactly what we are doing in the context of the Bill.  We are setting the age at 13 years in accordance with the recommendations of the committee and others and allowing for a review at a future date.<\/p><p>I did not say earlier that consideration was also given by my Department and Government with regard to how a digital age of consent of 16 years would be difficult to monitor and enforce.  I am speaking as a father of two girls now in their 20s.  They grew up in an age when youngsters were far more tech-savvy than I was.  I assure the committee from my experience at home that children aged 13, 14 and 15 years of age have a great deal of knowledge and information technology literacy.  Whether we like it, they are in a position to circumvent requirements for parental consent and requirements relating to advices, regulation or whatever.  They can do so with relative ease because we do not have age verification methodologies.  This is also important in the context of setting ages.<\/p><p>I put it to Deputy Shortall that the matter of child protection is one that can be validly associated with this legislation.  It is not that the GDPR is directly involved in child protection matters but there are consequences.  One of the consequences is the putting together of an EU-wide code of conduct.  I see that as being a great advantage in providing protection for children irrespective of where the child is, where the controller is or where the processor is.  That is why the role of the Data Protection Commissioner, once given the power in this legislation to make a submission, is important.  I am quite satisfied that encouragement from this office and influence or authority from the office in Dublin will have the effect of playing into and participating in a European data protection board and code of compliance.  That will deal with many of the issues put forward in terms of child protection.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that amendment No. 34 will add a greater level of strength to our debate.  I am concerned about any departure from the strict reading of the GDPR for obvious reasons.  I have heard what Deputy Shortall has said, but she is not long out of government and she was not long in government either, as it happened.  It is simply not practically possible to put forward amendments that would have the consequence of bringing about infringement proceedings against Ireland.<\/p><p>I ask the Deputy to accept that on the basis of facts that are within her own knowledge by virtue of having been a Member of Parliament for a long time.  Her party supports Ireland's membership of the EU and is familiar with EU law.  We cannot dip in and out of EU law in the manner the Deputy would like us to believe we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#R00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1047,"content":"<p>Is the Minister saying we cannot protect children from direct marketing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#S00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>Not at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#S00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>We cannot protect children's data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#S00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>Of course we can do that in conjunction with our EU colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#S00500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>When will we do it?

I cannot accept the deletion of this provision, as proposed in amendment No. 35.  It is an appropriate and legitimate provision.

Amendment No. 36 is part of a bigger structural adjustment to this part of the Bill.  The insertion of the phrase &quot;in particular the following&quot; is intended as an extra layer of precaution for what is one of the more important sections of the Bill in that it functions as what the Minister might call a toolbox for many other sections.  Many other sections refer back to this section and the phrase &quot;in particular the following&quot; is used elsewhere in the Bill to stipulate extra protections or precautions, so it is not unreasonable to insist on its inclusion here.  Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 depend on each other.  The inclusion of the phrase &quot;subject to suitable and specific measures&quot; also appears many times in the Bill and points us back to section 35.  Section 35 and the suitable and specific measures contained therein are important for the most part and are lifted from various parts of the GDPR, but the way section 35 is organised in the Bill renders optional very important aspects of data protection.<\/p><p>The issue of explicit consent is something we will come back to on section 45.  I understand why explicit consent needs to be optional in section 35 as the GDPR provides for exemptions to explicit consent.  As we understand it, the GDPR does not provide for exemptions with regard to section 35(1)(b) and (c). <font color=\"#FF42F9\"> <\/font>I do not understand why limitations on access to personal data that are processed in the workplace should not be a mandatory measure in section 35.  The same applies to the issue of imposing time limits for the erasure of personal data and mechanisms to ensure these time limits are adhered to.  The purpose of our amendments is to rearrange section 35, delete some of the so-called suitable and specific measures, such as explicit consent, which is a necessity of the GDPR, and to separate others as mandatory, hence the use of &quot;shall&quot; instead of &quot;may&quot; in page 26, line 14, in amendment No. 42.<\/p><p>I will skip some of the following amendments because Deputy Daly will deal with them.  Amendment No. 43 should be taken together with amendment No. 47 to section 37.  They are essentially the same amendment.  The central point in this amendment is the requirement for the Minister to provide a written rationale should he or she proceed to introduce regulations that go against the advice of the data protection commission.  The amendment was proposed by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins in the Seanad and it seems to me to be entirely reasonable.  It seems sensible and entirely workable and appropriate that such a written rationale would be put before the Committee on Justice and Equality.  I do not see how it would compromise the independence of the commission.  The point is to ensure heightened accountability for the Minister when creating regulations.<\/p><p>There are a number of State projects about which the Data Protection Commissioner has concerns.  The commissioner has opened a section 10 investigation into the public services card and the single customer view which is one of the biggest data sharing projects in the history of the State.  It is almost unprecedented.<\/p><p>It is highly unusual and should set off alarm bells for the Government, yet the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which claims it is the data controller for the public services card project, continues to double down on the expansion of the project even though it knows that the coming into force of the GDPR is just around the corner.  We have an example of the Department and the Minister ignoring the advice of the Data Protection Commissioner and ploughing on regardless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#U02000","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1126,"content":"<p>This is a very important grouping but, unfortunately, it is cumbersome and deals with many issues, some of which are similar but not identical.  It is an important group of amendments for us and I will break them down because some are more interconnected than others.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 36 to 41, inclusive, involve tweaking what we call suitable and specific measures and how we get around that.  We have to see it in the context of section 35 which deals with these suitable and specific measures for processing data.  In general throughout the Bill, these measures apply to the processing of special categories of data and are used as a substitute for getting a person's consent to process his or her most sensitive data.  What is contained in these sections is significant.  Under Article 9 of the GDPR, processing of these categories is strictly prohibited unless one of ten conditions apply.  The first of those conditions is that the person has to give explicit consent.  That is fairly clear.  The other nine categories involve matters such as processing being legal if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject, for the purpose of public health, cross-border threats to health and other such matters.  Most of the conditions allowing special categories of data to be processed, apart from the one on explicit consent, have some aim to protect either the data subject's interests or the public interest.<\/p><p>Suitable and specific measures, which is the term we are examining, are used as an alternative to the obligation to get explicit consent.  That is contained in sections 39, 43, 45 to 47, inclusive, 49, 50, 54 and 65.  They will apply in many circumstances.  This is a significant part of the Bill for processing sensitive data in the context of employment and social welfare law, scientific or other research purposes, pensions, if the Government gets its way, getting a mortgage, and in the context of a substantial public interest, which we discussed previously.  The idea of suitable and specific measures is that they are technical and organisational safeguards such as limiting access by staff to sensitive data and so on.  We all remember the fellow who was selling the data in the then Department of Social Protection for &euro;23 a throw and all the rest.<\/p><p>In the Bill as it stands, there is a list of measures that might be in section 35(1) but none of them is mandatory.  In the case of the first one, consent, there is a reason they cannot be mandatory in every case.  For example, for statistical purposes it might not be viable for somebody from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to get consent to process statistics on the number of people of a particular religion in Ireland or whatever.  There are others, the ones that are subject to our amendment No. 38, that face no obstacle in terms of being mandatory.  Those are limitations on access to prevent unauthorised consultation, alteration or disclosure of this most sensitive data by staff, time limits on the length of time an organisation can hold on to data and targeted training for people who will be handling the data.<\/p><p>We believe it is reasonable that when suitable and specific measures are being used to give <i>carte blanche<\/i>to organisations or public bodies to access and process sensitive data, access limits, time limits for storage and training should be mandatory.  That is our key concern.  Also, the Government clearly envisages situations where measures to safeguard data should be mandatory in some instances.  We are saying we should not leave it to the individual Ministers but make it somewhat clearer now.  I will not go into a huge amount of detail but we want to have safeguards implemented to stop invasion.  We want that to be obligated rather than a minimum standard to apply.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 38.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 36 simply seeks to add the words &quot;in particular&quot; before a list of possible, suitable and specific measures.  The phrase &quot;in particular&quot; is used elsewhere in the Bill.  It is also used in the GDPR and the shorthand for it is that we should look at the measures first before we go looking for any others because the list of possible suitable and specific measures spelled out in section 35(1) are in part taken from the GDPR itself.  As they are important and potentially strong technical measures to safeguard people's privacy, we believe they should be considered first, in particular the measures that are being either implemented or laid out in the regulation.<\/p><p>In terms of amendment No. 37, the idea is to add to the list of measures that might be included among the suite of suitable and specific measures.  The ones we are proposing are modelled on the German law which incorporated the GDPR but seek to add other options such as testing the effectiveness of technical, organisational and security measures regularly to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing services and systems related to the processing of personal data, including the ability to restore availability and access rapidly in the event of a physical or technical incident.  It could be the case that a given Minister might specify additional measures such as these in regulations.  I accept that could happen but it appears to us that it would be far better and more useful to have a reminder in the legislation about, first, the importance of mandating organisations to test their safeguarding measures regularly rather than just putting them in place and realising ten years later that they are not fit for purpose and have leaked a great deal of data and, second, to keep their security systems up to date and ensure they cannot lose a pile of sensitive data just because there is a power cut or whatever.  That is perfectly reasonable.  That is the first grouplet.  I know this is difficult, technical and monumentally boring stuff, but as the amendments have been grouped in this way, we have to persevere.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 42, if our amendments Nos. 37 to 41, inclusive, succeed, this one can probably be withdrawn because we have provided something similar in the previous amendments.  We are proposing in this amendment that, first, any regulations made under the section either to identify suitable and specific measures or specify that some of those measures are mandatory shall first identify different measures for different categories of personal data, different categories of controllers and so on and, second, specify that at least one of the measures set out in the list in section 35 is mandatory.  Regulations in regard to suitable and specific measures are a requirement in many different processing situations throughout the Bill.  They are crucial to safeguarding people's rights on their data, and because of that they should be granular and detailed.  They take into account the kinds of data being processed, by whom and the types of processing actions that are being taken.  It is important that at least one, but ideally more, of the measures listed in section 35 is made mandatory if the Minister is going to the bother of drawing up the regulations.<\/p><p>Our last amendment, No. 43, is another backstop.  We are placing an obligation on the Minister to seek the advice of the Commission before drawing up regulations under section 35 on suitable and specific measures.  If he decides to go ahead and ignore the advice of the commission, that will be his prerogative but he will have to give a statement to the Committee on Justice and Equality outlining the reason.  It is just another backstop.<\/p><p>It is a little like amendment No. 5 to section 6, which the select committee passed, in that it provides for greater oversight by the Oireachtas.  It would not impose a significant burden on the Minister to seek the advice of the data protection commission and he may choose not to adopt this advice, provided he informs the joint committee of his reason for not doing so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#V00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1128,"content":"<p>Before I invite the Minister to address the group of amendments, will Deputy Daly clarify which amendment or amendments she proposes to withdraw?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#W00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>I am not withdrawing any amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#W00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1130,"content":"<p>I apologise for my mistake.

I will start with the good news, however.  Having regard to the Deputy's contribution and the content of the amendment, I will accept amendment No. 36.  However, I am not in a position to accept the other amendments and I will set out the reasons for my decision.<\/p><p>On section 35, which deals with suitable and specific measures for processing, we are establishing a package or toolbox of suitable and specific measures to be applied in the context of data processing under certain later sections of the Bill.  I strongly advise that we read this section in conjunction with sections 43, 45, 46, 47 and 50 because all of these sections make the use of suitable and specific measures mandatory.  The choice of which measure from the toolbox is to be used will depend on the individual circumstances of the processing.<\/p><p>While I agree with Deputy Daly that this is important, I stress that the safeguards we are discussing are in addition to, and not a substitute for, the technical and organisational measures under the risk-based approach in Article 24 of the GDPR.  These additional measures are justified by the fact that they will apply to special categories of personal data under Article 9.  In some cases, encryption of the personal data concerned might be highly desirable but in other cases the appointment of a data protection officer by the controller might in essence be more effective and practical.In this context, I draw attention to section 35(4), which will permit the specification of compulsory safeguards with respect to certain types of data processing. <\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendments proposed by Deputies Daly and Wallace because they would impose a disproportionately heavy or difficult burden on many controllers in circumstances where such burdens would not be necessary.  Amendment No. 38, for example, proposes to make all measures in subsection (2) mandatory in all cases.  This would impose additional and highly disproportionate obligations on, for example, trade unions handling membership data, schools and voluntary organisations handling health data of pupils or members.  In the case of a school, for instance, this could relate to information about allergies to which certain children are susceptible or perhaps religious groups or practices.  Such obligations and duties would be onerous and heavy in circumstances where the ordinary running of the organisation or school may not give rise to any type of disproportionate obligation or mandatory work that might be regarded as excessive. <\/p><p>The amendments, in particular, amendment No. 38, would place a high burden on elected representatives making representations on behalf of constituents, especially where issues arise concerning medical treatment.  Public representatives deal with such matters daily, for example, in respect of the fair deal scheme, on which we make representations and seek information and services on behalf of constituents.  This is part of the routine work we do.  It is important to note, in the context of reading this legislation, that this is much more than a theoretical exercise.  It imposes real and practical obligations which must be enforceable, including on Oireachtas Members and our colleagues on local authorities.  It also extends to clubs, organisations, societies, trade unions, schools and health organisations.  While it is important that there is compliance with the legislation and the GDPR as we enter this new era, it is also important that we do not make matters so burdensome and onerous as to become unworkable.  This is a difficulty with amendment No. 38.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 37 is largely based on subsection (1) of section 35 but it incorporates provisions from Article 32(1)(<i>b<\/i>)(<i>c<\/i>) and (<i>d<\/i>) of the GDPR, which are already applicable.  It is not necessary to go further because this article of the GDPR is clear and is being transposed.  <\/p><p>Similarly, amendment No. 43 seeks to impose a heavy procedure in respect of any regulations made under the section.  If I understand Deputy Daly correctly, it seeks to impose an obligation on the data protection commission to provide advice in response to every consultation and an obligation on Ministers to inform the relevant Oireachtas committee in cases where the advice is not followed.  I remind members of Article 57 of the GDPR, which allows the data protection commission to inform Oireachtas committees directly of any concerns it may have following consultations on proposed amendments.  This will enable the relevant committee to monitor any regulations made subsequently.  This approach is much more practical and also carries the import of which Deputy Daly spoke.<\/p><p>I do not want a circumstance to arise in which we or bodies across society are faced with a heavy procedure and onerous and burdensome obligations.  Section 35, as it stands, establishes an appropriate and balanced package of measures.  It sets out a mechanism where specific measures are made mandatory in certain cases.  On balance, it is proportionate and deals with circumstances satisfactorily.  It is against this background and the need for balance between protection and safeguards, on the one hand, and obligations, on the other, that I am unwilling to accept the amendments, other than amendment No. 36.  My amendment No. 44 proposes to delete subsection (7) from the section. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#W00900","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>Like the Minister, I will start with the easy part by agreeing with his decision to accept amendment No. 36.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 37 proposes to delete paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) from section 35(1).  However, it would simply move them to section 35(2).  Amendment No. 38 which would insert the three paragraphs dealing with limitations and access to personal data, strict time limits and specific targeted training proposes a new section.  However, it would be mandatory and no longer discretionary.<\/p><p> The legislation is torturous and will torture people throughout the country.  It will set up an industry for individuals who will call themselves data protection officers.  They will become the supremos in their organisations.  I regret that I am certain that it will become a lawyer's holiday.  The Bill is complicated and virtually impenetrable in parts and has us stuck in a committee room for 3 hours and 40 minutes.  Members of the public have to be able to navigate legislation.  Legislation has to be comprehensible to them, but this is not.  I acknowledge Deputy Clare Daly's intention, but my concern is that the amendment would worsen the torture by providing for even more requirements under the legislation.  If we always had large data controllers who were controlling the data of individuals and there was a divergence in power between large data controllers and the individual, I would support all of these measures, but we must recognise that small numbers of individuals who come together will also be data controllers and we are imposing huge obligations on them.  It is not the case that we are dealing with Facebook and a couple of individuals whose rights we want to protect; we are dealing with small groups of people who come together to process data and they will have to read the legislation and understand it.  The Minister mentioned trade unions.  I was concerned about the impenetrability of the Bill before we commenced and while I acknowledge that Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace are well intentioned in their amendments, we need to simplify the legislation.  It is not the case that there is a big, bad data controller on one side and the individual on the other.  Most individuals will be unfortunate enough to find themselves in a scenario where they are also data controllers or data processors.  On balance, I would stick with sections 35 and 36, as drafted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#W01000","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>If we follow Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's advice, we will have to start over with the Bill.

The legislation is torturous and complex not only for the committee but also will be for all organisations in society from now on.  That is the reality with which we are dealing.  The GDPR is being incorporated into domestic law, but the legislation does not implement it.  Even if we did nothing, the GDPR would come into effect on 25 May.  It is directly applicable and will supersede Irish law.  We are dealing with exemptions, derogations and so on under this legislation.  Much of the criticism of the Government has resulted from it trying to exempt itself from provisions and leaving the State open to litigation in other areas.  Some of the measures we have proposed are intended to avoid that happening.  It is complex and a mess.  The addition of Part 5 which is essentially a different Bill in the middle of the legislation does not help either, but that is not the fault of the amendments.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is accepting amendment No. 36.  Amendment No. 37 provides for a model similar to the German model.  Mandating organisations to test their safeguarding measures regularly and keep their security systems up to date would not be onerous.  A Minister could do it by regulation.  It would hardly be a big deal, as it happens in other areas.  However, we can revisit the issue.  Perhaps it is the lateness of the hour and the complexity of the issues involved, but I was not fully clear on some of the points the Minister made in that regard.  It is a mandatory element, but we will revisit the matter on Report Stage.  We will withdraw amendments Nos. 38 and 42 on that basis, but with regard to amendment No. 43, I do not see what the problem would be in obliging the Minister to seek the advice of the commission before he drew up the regulations.  He would not have to listen to commission officials, but if he did not, he should inform the D&aacute;il as to why not.  That provision would not be onerous and should be inserted.

A distinction could be drawn between them.  However, if the data are abused, even in a small organisation, the effect can be just as harmful.  The difficulty lies in trying to be reasonable in the treatment of small organisations that are trying to do a great deal on limited resources, while ensuring all organisations, big and small, are careful with data and ensure there are no breaches.  The legislation and the GDPR set a high bar and amendments Nos. 37 and 38 would not heighten the bar greatly.

We might agree with Sinn F&eacute;in in opposing the entire section but for starters, I will set out the position on our amendments.<\/p><p>The section seems to give far too much scope to third party data processing for non-statutory schemes, especially given that the section describes a situation whereby the consent of the data subject will be bypassed.  I do not believe it would be too burdensome to simply require the relevant third parties working on non-statutory projects to obtain consent to process personal data.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 46 represents a small change but it could be an important one.  Under section 37, as currently worded, it seems that the processing of personal data in the public interest would be possible without being specified in regulations made by the Minister.  Who then would decide what constitutes the public interest?  Who gets to process data in the public interest?  Our amendment seeks to make processing in the public interest explicitly dependent on regulations.  In other words, ministerial regulations should be mandatory for such data processing.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 47 is the same as amendment No. 43, which we discussed earlier.  Amendment No. 48 attempts to introduce some more detail of Article 23 of the general data protection regulation into the Bill.  Article 23 details the restrictions member states can impose on the rights of data subjects for various reasons.  These could include reasons of national security.  Article 23(2) lists specific provisions that any legislative measure referred to in Article 23(1) shall contain, where relevant.  Our amendment is designed to introduce more of these specific provisions into the Bill.  It includes a reference to how storage periods for data should be specified in any regulations introduced.  Moreover, limitations should be specified as to the purpose of data processing.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 49 represents an attempt to introduce an extra layer of protection that we believe is necessary given the wide-ranging powers conferred on Ministers by section.  The lines are taken from elsewhere in the Bill, including section 48, which borrows heavily from the GDPR wording.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Y02300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1172,"content":"<p>I will try to be as brief as possible.  There are groupings and mini-groupings.  I am open to supporting the Sinn F&eacute;in opposition to the section in its entirety.<\/p><p>We are trying to go for a middle road or whatever.  At the moment, the Bill proposes that the processing of personal data shall be lawful if it is necessary and proportionate and for it to be done by or on behalf of a controller in order to administer any non-statutory scheme once the legal basis for the administration of that scheme is a function conferred by law on the controller who wants to do the processing.  To break that down, it means that because the processing can be done on behalf of a controller - let us call him or her controller A - as long as he or she has a function conferred in law then somebody else - let us call him or her processor B - can process data on his or her behalf without any of the restrictions in the GDPR.  It is a significant issue.<\/p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland, for example, has a statutory function.  It could come up with an online marketing campaign for the Wild Atlantic Way to collect emails, place banner and target ads on social media and so on.  The marketing company concerned would be administering a non-statutory scheme on behalf of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in its statutory function.  This is giving such a marketing scheme a wide exemption from consent and the other obligations in data protection which the GDPR is about.  Not only is it far too wide and includes large numbers of organisations, it is also unfair on a marketing company which is not working for the statutory organisation which has to comply with onerous data protection guidelines, as appropriate, given its importance.  This is an important issue.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 46 is about trying to limit the circumstances in which the exemptions the Government wants to provide under this section can apply.  We think it is clear that the GDPR envisages that in circumstances where point E of the regulation applies, which determines more precisely the specific requirements for processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing is being relied on, member states will adopt the rules of the GDPR via specific and precise requirements which cover processing where this data is being relied upon.  The exemption is wide and vague.  There is no guarantee that any Minister would pass regulations specifying any rules or limitations and so on.  If the Government wants to give very broad powers to State and non-State bodies for them to not have to abide by the data protection rules that everybody else has to abide by, which is what we are discussing, then the Government has to set out the limits of those powers.  It cannot be left to the vagueness of section 37.  At an absolute minimum, therefore, a requirement for Ministers to set out more precisely the ways and means by which personal data can be processed under the public interest official authority exemptions is reasonable.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 47 is like amendment No. 43, in that it asks that the Minister would seek the advice of the commission before drawing up regulations.  Again, that is not a significant burden and is in line with the amendments passed earlier.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 48 in this group states that regulations created under section 37 must specify a few things as the Bill stands.  Section 37 deals with regulations to allow statutory and, in some instances, non-statutory bodies to be exempt from the rules of GDPR in processing personal data.  This is not insignificant.  We propose to add a number of things to the list of regulations in the section which the section has to specify.  They include how long the data can be kept, what it can be used for and the kinds of processing operations and procedures they can undergo.  The additional things we have specified are taken from Article 6 and Recital 45 of the GDPR, which is why we chose them.  We feel that is important and in line with the GDPR.  <\/p><p> As Deputy Wallace said, the wording for amendment No. 49 has been lifted straight from section 48 which deals with the special categories of data, that is, the most sensitive, and given that fact the protections under this section should be in line with that because section 37 is too vague as it stands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Y02400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1174,"content":"<p>The difficulties with the section have been well outlined.  There are a number of exceptions and qualifications which do not exist in the GDPR.  I would be of the view that if we are going to try to have such a detailed piece of legislation it is probably likely to be the case that the legislation need not be as detailed and the GDPR be allowed to have direct effect in many respects.  If we are, then the wording should reflect fairly exactly what is in the GDPR.  As far as I am concerned, the purposes which are outlined in section 37 are fairly well covered, in particular anything related to the public interest in Articles 6 and 9 of the GDPR.  It would be as well to allow them to have direct effect, but where we are trying to mimic them the analogous wording should be used.  I am concerned that, as far as I am aware, there is no provision for non-statutory schemes or anything like that in the GDPR.  That is a particularly problematic and questionable provision which could be the basis for litigation.<\/p> <p>  In a general sense, my view is that the section is not necessary.  I will support the amendment, but I am not sure it is necessary or even desirable to have this level of exception outlined for so many areas and functions of Government when the direct effect of those sections of the GDPR would cover them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Z00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1175,"content":"<p>Before the Minister responds, I would like to give a general overview on section 37.  It is appropriate that there is a statutory scheme which deals with the processing of data which is being carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority.  I will not support the amendment which seeks to delete paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of that section.  One of the consequences of the proliferation of the Internet is the undermining of expertise and, to a certain extent, official authority.  The State should try to achieve the objective of trying to do good by the citizen even if it does not always do so.  It should try to ensure that issues such as the health of citizens and crimes against citizens are dealt with properly and adequately.  We should be open to allowing a statutory provision which recognises that work can be carried out in the public interest.  The performance of a function conferred by a person under a statute is a performance of a function which is passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas comprising the elected Members of the people and it should be protected and recognised that is intended to be for the public good.<\/p> <p>  In respect of any non-statutory schemes, it is frequently the case that the Government will introduce a non-statutory scheme which will have the support of the elected Members.  That is deserving of protection.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the comments of the Minister in respect of amendment No. 46.  If one is going to process personal data for the purpose of the public interest or the exercise of official authority, one should probably do so by way of a regulation.  I am interested in hearing whether the Minister is prepared to go for the mandatory requirement, as opposed to the discretionary requirement which is in place at present.  I will support amendment No. 47 since it is identical to one we supported previously.  Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 introduce further provisions which are not necessary for the purposes of what the section is about, namely, allowing the processing of data when it is in the public interest and being done for official authority.  It is not the case that official authority is always bad.  It is there primarily to protect citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Z00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1176,"content":"<p>I will not accept the amendments.  The retention of section 37 is not only desirable but it is, to my mind, essential.  I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for his support in that regard.  This is an area which was the subject matter of some debate in the Seanad.<\/p><p>For the same reasons as then, I am not in a position to accept the amendments now.  The purpose of section 37 is to underpin data processing carried out under Article 6.1.  Article 6.3 provides that the basis for the processing referred to in Article 6.1 should be laid down either in EU law or national law and, in the case of paragraph (e), shall be necessary for the performance of the task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority that may from time to time be vested in the controller.<\/p><p> Unlike in some member states, Acts of the Oireachtas that confer functions on public authorities and bodies do not normally provide specifically for the processing of personal data for the purposes of the discharge of their statutory functions.  This is implicit.  To ensure legal certainty following the entry into force of the GDPR, section 37(1)(a) provides that the processing of personal data shall be lawful to the extent that such processing is necessary for the performance of a function conferred by an enactment or the Constitution.  I am back to what we said earlier, about ensuring that the practical outcome of this legislation will not give rise to serious issues from a workability point of view.  What this means here is a statutory function must be conferred on the controller and that the processing shall be lawful to the extent that the processing is necessary and proportionate for the performance of that function.<\/p><p> Section 37(1)(b) deals with data processing that arises where non-statutory schemes, programmes or funds are administered by controllers for the performance of a function conferred by an enactment.  Let me give a couple of examples.  Let us take the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which operates on a non-statutory basis on an ongoing basis, for example, the free fuel scheme, the free travel scheme, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, and the school meal programme.  All of these schemes necessitate the processing of personal data.  This processing is compliant with the GDPR because Recital 41 states that where the GDPR refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require an Act of Parliament each time.<\/p><p> The practical day-to-day reality of this is such that these schemes and other similar non-statutory measures, such as we had recently with the payment that was made by the State to victims of flooding and, even more recently with the fodder shortage, are all beneficial.  In many respects they are a response of the State to a certain set of circumstances that often require an urgent response.  I would not like to have a body of law or a legal framework where some of these schemes are jeopardised or called into question because of legal uncertainty in respect of data processing, because their continued operation is very much in the public interest.<\/p><p> Subsection (4) allows for the making of regulations to specify the processing of personal data.  It is necessary for the performance of a task to be carried out in the public interest by a controller and it is necessary in the exercise of official authority.  The need for specification arises here because, as recognised in Recital 45 of the GDPR, it is a matter for national law whether the controller is performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another legal person subject to private rather than public law.  The recital recognises that private entities may perform a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, and the purpose of subsection (4) is to ensure transparency as well as legal certainty in such cases.  Subsection (5) specifies the conditions.<\/p><p> I am conscious of the time and I am also conscious of the fact we really did go through this in the Seanad in some detail, but it seems the amendments tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly may well be based on a misunderstanding, because the regulations referred to in subsections (4) and (5) will not create a lawful basis for processing.  That already exists elsewhere.  Rather, for reasons of transparency and legal certainty, they specify processing that is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.<\/p><p> The proposal in amendment No. 48, to add paragraphs (c) to (f), inclusive to subsection 5, in many respects cuts across Article 5 of the GDPR and is not, therefore, GDPR compliant.  Article 5 principles are directly applicable in all cases without the need for any particular specification of this type.  The purpose of the provisions in subsections (2), (3) and (6) is to permit the making of regulations to facilitate the continued operation of the common travel area.  Under SI 220 of 30 March 2016, for example, air and sea carriers are already permitted to process personal data for the purpose of the preservation of the common travel area.  These subsections will permit the making of new regulations to replace those regulations in due course, but this is even more important in the context of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  In short, the retention of section 37 is essential to ensure an element of certainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Z00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1178,"content":"<p>If it were possible that we could complete this particular section it would be a good cut-off point.

If we find ourselves at that pace tomorrow, we will be in some trouble.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#BB00100","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525248000,"counter":1198,"content":"<p>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525248000,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 1.20 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Thursday, 3 May 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
