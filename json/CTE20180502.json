When it comes to the detail on any issues regarding specific performance indicators, the relevant line Departments are best placed to address such matters.<\/p> <p>  Following the Government's submission to the select committee on arrangements for budgetary scrutiny in June 2016, the first public service performance report was published in April last year.  The second publication, the public service performance report 2017, was published last Friday, 27 April.  The performance report is a key element of a suite of expenditure reform measures implemented in Ireland.  The objective of this report is to create a space in the budget process for performance dialogue, focusing on results delivered from public expenditure in terms of outputs and impacts.  An ongoing focus on efficient and effective delivery of public services is an essential part of an expenditure framework targeted at ensuring sustainable public finances.<\/p> <p>  Performance budgeting was introduced initially on a pilot basis for the 2011 Estimates, before being rolled out across all Departments.  At that time, with the revised Estimates volume, REV, being published in spring each year, it was possible to report on outturn information for the previous year alongside the REV targets for the current year.  However, following changes to the budgetary timetable at European level, the outturn information cannot be provided in the REV due to the timing of REV publication in December each year.  The performance report addresses this shortfall in regard to outturn information by providing timely quantitative information on what was delivered with public funds in the previous year.  This creates an opportunity for meaningful dialogue on Government performance.<\/p> <p>  The report clearly presents relevant performance indicators in a dedicated, focused document.  The report is arranged by Vote group and provides an overview of the funding allocated to each Vote group as well as staff numbers, trends across categories of expenditure and a breakdown of the composition of spend and spend by programme.  Output information is then presented in a dashboard format at programme level.  Each Vote group then reports on a number of key performance metrics for each programme area across a range of activities.  Key metrics are identified by line Departments themselves. <\/p> <p>  This year the report also includes an update on the equality reporting pilot that is under way.  The ongoing work regarding equality reporting in Ireland follows the programme for a partnership Government commitment to develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  Some six relevant diverse policy areas from six Departments were selected, with the equality dimension of gender the focus at the current time.  Those Departments were asked to identify goals and associated targets and reported on these in the revised Estimates volume 2018, published last December.  The public service performance report 2017 contains an update on progress on achieving the targets set for each of the pilot areas.  <\/p> <p>  As this is only the second year a public service performance report has been produced, it is expected that the presentation of information and approach taken will be developed and refined over time.  The intention is that, over time, the information provided in the report will build up a picture of performance trends within a given sector through consistent reporting of key metrics.  Outturn information can then be mapped against targets to give a picture of what is being delivered through public resources and help to track progress towards strategic outcomes.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform welcomes feedback from the Oireachtas on how to develop the report so that it best supports the scrutiny needs of committees.  I thank the committee.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Loughlin.

As stated in the opening statement, it was one of a number of reforms which were introduced in the area of expenditure management to try to ensure that the budgetary process is focused on what is being delivered with funds.  The performance report provides detail for each Government Department.  Drilling down further below that detail, a spending review process goes into a lot more detail on what is being delivered and how effectively public services are being delivered.  The output from the spending review process, alongside the performance report, then feeds into budgetary discussions when settling overall Estimate amounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Page 17 referred to the Department of Education and Skills and outlined what has been delivered.

This feeds into the overall discussion in terms of the spending review process which was carried out last year.  A more detailed job of work was done which specifically examined special education and resource teaching.<\/p> <p>  The performance indicator will not provide the answers by itself, but it provokes discussion.  In terms of analysing the spending review process of expenditure across all Government programmes over a three-year period, the idea is that by focusing on performance indicators from the performance report and carrying out further analysis through the spending review process we can address those issues so that at budget time the discussion is based on facts.  As the Deputy said, we can determine whether something is fulfilling a demographic need or there are other underlying drivers. <\/p> <p>  On other areas of expenditure such as social protection, a paper last year looked at the key drivers underpinning growth figures relating to disability allowance.  The performance report is one part of a suite of measures which were introduced to try to ensure the whole budgetary discussion is focused on the facts in order to determine whether changes are down to demographics or other drivers are involved and what is driving increased demand for services in certain areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>This is the second year that this has been published.

On first reading, it seems that some of the metrics are very basic.  We spend a great deal of time in the Chamber discussing the health and justice and equality budgets in particular.  The Government spends a great deal of time reacting to all kinds of crisis in those two budget areas.  When one looks at the metrics in health and in justice and equality, the information we need is simply not there.  Let me give some examples, people waiting for a longer time than 52 weeks for first access to acute hospital care.  That number is growing dramatically.  A time series would have been helpful on that to give us the real information to decide on how much money we need to get those disgraceful figures into something we could stand over as politicians.  In respect of justice and equality, I have no idea of what is happening in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the detection of crime.  We have burglaries, although it is a terrible crime but they are probably lower down the scale than other much more serious crime and the actual jobs that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does.  The information seems to be very basic and does not seem to be that informative or give us any kind of fundamental grounds on which we can calculate what expenditure should be in the future.

They certainly provided a detailed overview of the financial resources but did not try to link those financial resources with outputs.  The performance budgeting initiative is a tool that when one looks at the REV, the high level goals are linked into the Department's statement of strategy and the programmes selected by Departments should also be linked into those statements of strategy.  The Departments themselves select the metrics.  The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to try to ensure that the metrics are measurable.  The review that was carried out in 2016 was focused on ensuring that the information being presented was measurable, so that as Deputy Broughan pointed out that over time one can develop a time series, so one can see what direction the various outputs are going.

I know a great deal of work goes into producing this report that allows us to be in a position to scrutinise the various budgetary commitments from a monetary perspective and the different avenues by which the issues are addressed.  I have not gone through the report in enough detail to be able to question it in depth, but I am sure I will get an opportunity in the coming weeks to address it.<\/p> <p>  I am not so sure that the title is necessarily appropriate.  My understanding of a performance report would be where I might be in a position to measure the output, which the Department officials call the performance against policy commitments made by Government in a programme for Government, for example.  A glaringly obvious example in the report occurs in the note on school transport routes in  the Department of Education and Skills.  There are approximately 6,770 school transport routes, which is an increase year on year of 474.  I have no doubt that there are fewer children availing of school transport provided by the State on foot of the changes that were made to the rules pertaining to how people get on a bus.  If one did not qualify, but yet there was a place available, there was an opportunity for children to get on that bus.  That is not the situation anymore.  It is more refined than it was and that is the type of measurement and performance that I would like to quantify and qualify, but I do not get that opportunity here.  Of course, I could use it to go and measure myself, but if the intention is for this committee to measure and adjudicate on performance on behalf of the public and allow them to make up their minds thereafter when the opportunity arises, so be it.<\/p><p>However, I do not think this information does that.  It is hard to find a means by which that can be done, but the programme for Government, for example, should be tested against the performance here and an adjudication made.  Some would say that the Department is discussing opinions rather than facts.  If I immediately see this and put down a parliamentary question asking how many children are availing of the school transport system, and I see a reduction, I do not see that measured here or the performance being quantified year on year.<\/p><p> The other issue relates to equality.  There are glaring issues in the public domain on equality, not only about the expectation of equality of opportunity.  Fairness in terms of gender and equality of pay for new entrants compared with workers employed prior to 2011 are two glaring issues that must be addressed and we need to see that there is progress on those.  Talks are ongoing on pay inequality regarding new entrants and we hope and expect that, by virtue of those talks taking place at all, there is a prospect of resolution.  We await the results of that.  Those are issues that do not jump out at me from the report.  I know that the Department has looked at pilot programmes for equality reporting that can be measured over time.  However, if one is talking about public service performance and if the public looks at this and wants to measure what progress have been made on equality, those are the two simple things that I would expect them to find in this report that they will not see.<\/p><p> Finally, I do not know how relevant this might be to today's discussion but the wider discussion relating to the Department of Health and the HSE and so on.  The State Claims Agency is accountable to the NTMA.  The NTMA is accountable to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  What interaction does the Department have in that chain with the State Claims Agency?  Does the Department, in turn, interact with other Departments based on the information provided to it by the NTMA on foot of actions that are taken, where the State Claims Agency is acting on behalf of the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#G01000","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the final question falls very much outside the officials' remit for today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#H00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525266000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The relevant relationship is with the Department of Finance rather than the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

The report also indicates whether the figures have risen or fallen.  Perhaps it is for the sectoral committees to flesh out or elaborate on the metrics in order to have a net picture.  However, here the report gives the figure for the new hectares of forest planted, it does not say how many trees were cut down in the same period, so one cannot see if net afforestation or forest cover has increased or declined.  There is an important debate around that because while we are planting there are large numbers of trees being cut down.  Similarly, with housing, the report refers to new housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies, I think the figure was 17,000.  However, I understand that over 2,000 HAP tenancies ended during the same period.  The report does not say this and, as a result, there is no net figure.  One might get the impression that there is an entirely forward momentum on HAP tenancies whereas there is also backward momentum.  Not all metrics can allow for this but in some cases one needs the net picture.  Some thought on that would be valuable.<\/p> <p>  It might not be possible to do this in all the metrics, but under each subcategory there is a total expenditure figure.<\/p><p>In the more detailed metrics, there are no cost figures but they might be helpful.  How much did it cost to do an extra 5,000 ha, for example, in the forest?  The report stated the extra 5,000 ha were planted but how much did it cost to do it?  It would allow us to say that if we wanted 10,000 ha or 15,000 ha, it would cost a specific sum.  It might be worth looking at.  On the first page of each departmental section, it might be useful to have comparative figures for the previous year.  I know capital is broken down in a chart for capital, current, pay and pension costs but it might be useful to have comparative figures from the previous year.  This is not just in terms of expenditure but also in terms of staff, so we can see if there is an increase in staff in health, for example.  It would be useful information.<\/p><p> To follow Deputy Cowen's point, as well as having numbers we need some way easily readable way of setting out targets or goals.  We do not need too much information in a report like this or it would become intimidating and one would not want to read it at all.  These would be the key points of announced Government strategies under a departmental heading, such as Rebuilding Ireland, for example.  We should have some of the key things it was hoped to achieve in order that people could at a glance consider if the figures suggest that goals set under a strategy or in the programme for Government are being met.  It would be helpful.  Perhaps there could be headline issues as I know not everything can be done in a report like this.  It would again be up to sectoral committees to look at these in more detail but we could have some of the key headlines in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#H01200","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The witnesses will be pleased to know I will not ask them to name the trees that were planted or anything like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#J00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525266000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Many of those suggestions should be taken on board.

The informatics are excellent.  For a Deputy or anybody to use these to inform the public of what is happening is most welcome.  That said, public service performance, in addition to continuing day-to-day service for people, is also about being cognisant of how we can improve and target services that see justified demands.  Whether one is a local councillor or an Oireachtas Member, there is a need not just for what Deputy Cowen mentioned about performance indicators for elements of the programme for Government but the demands made of public representatives, whether at local authority or council level, on a daily basis.  We have to follow not just demand but where there is a real need for it.  Somebody mentioned hospital waiting lists and we can look at the delays in the carer's allowance and the lack of money being put into disabled persons' grants.  We have had debate after debate in the D&aacute;il on the reintroduction of the motorised grant for people with a disability.  That is not even to mention the demand for home help.  I am just highlighting a few matters.  We can all empty our political book about representations we get.  There are extreme pressures because public service is about providing and improving the service for the servants we are for individuals and for the demands in our community.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned being able to show not just the number of jobs provided in a sector.  As politicians on all sides, we demand increased services but there seems to be a clear lack of specialist services.  For example, I cite speech therapy.  I wonder to what degree we can employ speech therapists to meet the promises we are giving and that the Department are saying will be put in place.  If we do not have the staff and cannot get them, we are kidding people about enhancing the public service.  Is it possible to put such things in an enhanced report next year as it improves?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#J00800","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525266000,"counter":47,"content":"<p>With regard to the demands for increased services, as I outlined previously, this is one of the reforms being introduced on the expenditure side.  The Ministers for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform at the 2016 budget announced the three-year expenditure review process.  This was completely different from the spending reviews that would have been carried out in 2011, where the focus was on delivering expenditure reductions to meet a fiscal target.  The focus now has Departments systematically looking at the money being spent on delivering services.  Part of this considers the demand on services and whether they are being delivered efficiently and in the most effective way.  This is a more detailed investigation through the spending review process.<\/p> <p>  For example, in 2017 the spending review looked at approximately 20 different areas right across Departments.  During the course of 2018, the spending review looked at approximately 30 different areas of Government expenditure.  The detail in this will be published alongside the mid-year expenditure report.<\/p><p>The idea is to address some of the issues.

Every Deputy and public representative receive correspondence from people demanding that they intervene so they can get a passport.  Last week, I heard the Minister say that he had brought in an additional 200 staff to try to meet the demand for passports.  Surely to God, as a performance indicator, we should be able to resolve a staffing problem within the Civil Service or wherever.  Earlier I mentioned the huge delays in decisions being made about whether people should be granted a carer's allowance.  I acknowledge there were problems in the downturn and the number of civil and public servants was reduced.  Where a demand is recognised and a real need has been identified, then we should be able to draft a plan and move people in the same way that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade can do in the passport service, even though there are still complaints about that service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#K00200","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The Department wants my system to be used now as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#K00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525266000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>As Deputy Breathnach has said, we have gone through a period during the downturn when the numbers in the public service were significantly reduced.

In her opening statement, Ms O'Loughlin stated \"The objective of this report is to create a space in the budget process for performance dialogue, focusing on results delivered from public expenditure in terms of outputs and impacts.\"  I can see the outputs in the report but not the impacts.  Let us look at the segment in the report dedicated to health.  On pages 11 to 13, inclusive, there is reference, using a plus or minus symbol, to additional services, hours, money or whatever that have been provided.  There is no reference to whether demographics have been considered or whether there has been an increase in the number of people requiring those services.  The data do not show the impact that the extra or reduced spend has had on the service user or who has been impacted by the services.<\/p> <p>  We have been told that there has been increased expenditure on mental health services.  Let us consider the figures for the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  If one looks at the top of page 15 one will see the first tabular statement, with the heading, \"Mental Health Services\".  In the third column of the second row, one will see the heading \"CAMHS referrals seen by Mental Health Services\" and the figures show that the number of people has been reduced by 2,082 when compared with last year's figure. <\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputies Boyd Barrett and Cowen that we can use the information contained in the report.  The information will allow us to probe further but it does not tell us, as a budget committee, the impact of extra expenditure or, conversely, reduced expenditure.  I am interested in hearing the thoughts of the officials on how we can improve the report.  What other work can the Department do to provide us with more detailed information?  More information would allow us to assess whether budgetary decisions have worked and I mean in terms of putting money into different areas.  We have heard from the budget office in Scotland, which has a slightly different name but which has done this work for quite some time.  It advised that we need to build in time for reflection and to evaluate past performance.  We need to assess the impact and effect our decisions are having.  Can the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform play a role in that?  Can this report be improved?  Do we need to conduct a separate body of work to assess impact?  It is incorrect to suggest that this report has provided any sort of analysis or information on impact. <\/p> <p>  My final point will follow on from what Deputy Cowen said about the State Claims Agency and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.

Mr. Kinnane cannot say that he and his officials have not been properly briefed because this issue has dominated discourse in this House for the past couple of days.

Over the past number of years we have developed what we call a whole-of-year budgetary process.  The revised Estimates volume, REV, is now published in December of each year.  That allows Oireachtas committees, during the first quarter of the year, to engage in detailed discussions with the line Departments on expenditure allocations for the current year and on the outputs that are to be delivered with those expenditure targets.  Also, the context and a series of impact indicators are set out in the REV.  There is a series of outputs for each programme within each Department but there is also a series of impact indicators that are designed to measure whether the programme has delivered the impact for citizens.<\/p> <p>  Due to the change in the budgetary timetable we now have the following issue.  If we did not have the public service performance report, the earliest time that the output information would have been published for each Department would have been in the REV in December.  Obviously that is far too late for a timely consideration of the output and the performance of Departments.  An opportunity for meaningful dialogue has now been created by publishing the information at the end of April because the committees, after giving detailed consideration to the Estimates and targets for this year, now have an opportunity to look back and assess what happened in the past year.  The targets for each Department will have been out in the REV last year.  The public service performance report allows the committees to have a detailed discussion and compare performance with the targets.<\/p> <p>  On a broader level within the budgetary process, the mid-year expenditure report sets out the baseline for expenditure in advance of the budget.  Tied into the publication of the mid-year expenditure report is the spending review process.  From January of this year, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has carried out a detailed analysis of large areas of expenditure across all Departments with a view to making the information available during the summer in advance of the budget, and in advance of the budgetary decisions being made.<\/p><p> The performance report does not exist in isolation.  It is one of a number of measures in place to assist all stakeholders and, in particular, the Oireachtas in considering departmental performance and budgetary options for subsequent years, a key element of which is an examination of the effectiveness of the current spend of over &euro;61 billion across all Departments and the impact and efficiency of service delivery.  The performance report assists this process but on its own does not provide the information.  It must be viewed alongside the spending review, the revised Estimates volume and the mid-term expenditure report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kinnane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#L00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I appreciate the presentation.  I may have got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning such that the witnesses should take what I am about to say with that caveat.  I love the Irish Civil Service.  If I was advising my children on their career options, I would tell them to into the public service or the Civil Service because young people can avail of major opportunities and learn a great deal by doing so.<\/p> <p>  On the question of how I would grade this report in terms of feedback, I could not even give it a D.  To be honest, I would give it an F in terms of what it does for me in providing feedback on public service performance.  There is interesting material in this report.  I hear from a lot of civil servants that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has done particularly well in the management of the crisis in terms of its own budget expenditure.  I note that pay expenditure in that Department has increased by 25% in the past five years while one of the Departments in which I am interested, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, has remained static in that time.  I note that the average pay for civil servants in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is &euro;49,000, whereas in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment it is &euro;39,000.  The same applies in respect of the Department of Finance.  It is a qualitative assessment of the characteristics of our public service that the real power lies within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I note that.<\/p> <p>  This review does not tell me how we are moving from relying on generalists to specialists, which is a strategic issue in terms of our thinking on how our public service develops.  I would like to know the background of the type of people we are taking into the public service and the staff turnover within Departments, including those that have a high staff turnover and those with a low staff turnover.  This report does not tell me any of this type of qualitative information.  It provides only the bare figures in terms of the pay and pensions bill but I would like more qualitative information on our civil servants.  For example, I would like to know how many are coming in from other organisations, how many are leaving to go to other organisations, the average length of time staff remain in Departments and so on.<\/p> <p>  There is much discussion around disclosure in the area of health.  As a matter of principle, all data relating to the public service should be publicly available at the touch of a button.  If there are road works taking place in a particular area, for example, I would like to be able to quickly find out, via the Internet, the name of the contractor, when the contract was written and so on.  We should be disclosing everything we do unless we are restricted from doing so on foot of data protection or security reasons.  All of the material and figures in this report should, by definition, be available in order that we can assess it, but that is not the case.<\/p> <p>  I will explain why I give this report an F grade.  I am interested in a number of areas covered in the report.  In respect of to the Department of Culture, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, for example, the report states, in the context of North-South co-operation, that the number of organisations supported by the Ulster Scots agency is up by 95 to 374.  Everyone knows that North-South co-operation is in dire straits and that this data tells us nothing.  I have real concerns about the state of the Irish language.  I hear regularly from people in the Gaeltacht that the language is dying.  There are no young children speaking Irish but one gets no sense of this from the data provided in the report.  According to the information it contains, attendance at clubanna &oacute;ige is up by 71 to 1,300.  What does this mean in the real world where the Gaeltacht areas are dying?<\/p> <p>  On heritage, I read a brilliant article yesterday written by P&aacute;driac Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust.  It is a damning indictment of the destruction of our environment that is currently taking place, with widespread loss of species and destruction of habitats.  The latter as been going on for a long time but is now reaching a critical point.  I get no sense of that from the report in terms of the data it provides regarding payments towards cessation of turf cutting on designated sites and so on.  What Deputy Lisa Chambers said is true.  What is the impact of what is happening?  This is difficult to assess because some of the issues, including the health or otherwise of our Gaeltacht, are long-term.  One cannot apportion success or failures in this regard to public service performance but these are the metrics by which we should be testing.<\/p> <p>  EUROSTAT published another major report yesterday.  The report in question shows that Ireland is the worst when it comes to the generation of plastic waste.  We produce an average of 61 kg each in plastic waste every year, which is twice the European average and 10 kg per person above the next worst country.  There is none of that information in this report.  I would be ambitious and say that if we are interested in carrying out performance reviews, then the report should refer to international comparisons - including in respect of where we stand in European league tables -  and five, ten, 20 and 50-year trend diagrams and analysis.  A mere tabular listing of how many organisations are supported by the Ulster Scots Agency, which is the quality of a lot of this material, does not tell me anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#L00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1525266000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>It is definitely the case that the Deputy got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050200002#L00400","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525266000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>The key point is that this report is not viewed in isolation.  It is one of a number of reforms that have been implemented with a view to driving the focus on performance, outputs and the effectiveness within which public services are being delivered.  The Deputy asked what type of civil servants are being recruited.  Over the last number of years a number of staff were recruited to the Irish Government Economics and Evaluation Service, IGEES, to assist in embedding an evaluation culture in Departments in order that we can constantly assess what is being delivered and whether it is effective and having an impact.  This performance report, grade F or not, is part of the effort to ensure that the focus is not only on the amount of money that is being spent but on whether it is delivering and having an impact for citizens.  This report is a snapshot of the process.  The spending review examines that process in more detail with a view to looking at all spending across a three year period.  This is a rolling cycle and such it is embedded within the budget process.  Likewise, all Departments are involved in this process; it is not just the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform doing the analysis.

From our point of view, it is a good start.

We have strategic policies such as Project Ireland 2040 to protect our coastal areas, which are of immense benefit to the country.  The committee has already completed pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill on plastic microbeads.  I do not expect Department of Public Expenditure and Reform officials to come in and have details of those policies with them.  However, as Oireachtas Members, we need to challenge what is being spent in those areas.  Is it enough?  Is it too much?  Are we getting value for money?  That is our role.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, Deputy Boyd Barrett has left.  As I said to him before he departed, I was delighted to hear him having such an interest in tree planting.  Ten or 12 years we were councillors together.  One member wanted every tree in the constituency to be named.  He will be glad to hear that 3,000 mature trees have been or are in the process of being planted in Cherrywood on a site of 163 acres.  I cannot give the details of what is being planted throughout the country.  However, I can give him a snapshot of what is happening in his area.<\/p> <p>  It is important not to take out of context some of the numbers presented here.  Given my area of interest, it is great to see the housing figures provided.  We are about to start either the tender process or the capital appraisal process relating to 846 sites throughout the country on which more than 13,000 social homes will be delivered.  They will be delivered this year, next year and in subsequent years.  It is not possible to get into that detail on one page in this document.  However, I certainly can through my committee.  We can put those pertinent to the officials in those Departments.<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome the document, which gives a great overview of the various Departments.  It gives great information that can be benchmarked off the previous or following years.  It is very easy to read and I love the detail it offers.  I also love the monthly economic bulletin the Department of Finance provides.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform gives a lot of detail.  I also get a lot of detail from the Department I am interested in, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We are never short on such detail.  When it is all out in the open, people can make their own decisions on whether the impacts we are having are good or bad, and they are to be challenged.  That is the role we, as Oireachtas Members, play.<\/p> <p>  I do not have any questions for the witnesses.  I thank them for the document, which contains the kind of detail that I like and that affords me the opportunity to delve further into details relating to particular Departments in a way in which I might not have done previously.

I am a senior research fellow at Trinity College Dublin and principal investigator of a Health Research Board-funded project examining socio-economic inequalities in population health.  The statement I am going to make today is informed by my published research on obesity using the Growing Up in Ireland, GUI, study, a large nationally representative cohort study of child development in Ireland that tracks the progress of two cohorts of approximately 20,000 children over a span of years.  These studies are instructive because they allow us to estimate the national prevalence of overweight and obesity in Ireland, how it changes over time and the factors impinging on same.  Like many others that have addressed this committee, I do not have good news.<\/p> <p>  Obesity is considered to have reached epidemic proportions in both adult and child populations.  According to figures provided by Growing Up in Ireland, 19% of children aged three years are overweight and 6% are obese.  These figures are extremely concerning from a population health perspective because obesity tends to track and children who are overweight or obese in childhood are more likely to maintain this status into adolescence and adulthood.  Some 55% of obese children will become obese adolescents, and 80% of obese adolescents will become obese adults.  Childhood obesity has downstream consequences for disease risk in later life, including risk for type 2 non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.  Psychological sequelae of childhood overweight or obesity include peer-group victimisation, lower self-esteem and depression.<\/p> <p>  Factors contributing to increased obesity among children are multitudinous and complex.  At its most simple, obesity results from a mismatch between energy intake and energy expenditure.  A host of factors have been identified at the individual level, including declining rates of physical activity, increased sedentary behaviour and changing dietary habits.  The environment in which our children are developing has been described as obeseogenic.  Parental overweight is one of the strongest predictors of childhood overweight reflecting the contribution of shared genes and shared environment.  We have previously shown that a child is 3.2 times more likely to be obese if one parent is overweight or obese and 9.5 times more likely to be obese if both parents are overweight or obese.  Moreover, overweight parents are less likely to spot overweight in their children.  Worryingly, our research suggests that 54% of parents of overweight children and 20% of parents of obese children in the Growing Up in Ireland study childhood cohort reported that in their view their children are about the right weight for their height.<\/p> <p>  Health promotion literature suggests that behaviour change and weight reduction can only come about once the individual recognises the need for change, yet it is clear that many parents have a poor understanding of appropriate body weight.  Parents shape their children&rsquo;s eating behaviour not only through the foods they make accessible to their children, but also through parental modelling, parenting practices and reinforcement.  Children&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; dietary intakes are correlated for most nutrients so intervention efforts should be designed to target parents and family units.<\/p> <p>  One of the most concerning findings from our research on childhood obesity with the Growing Up in Ireland cohorts is the stark socio-economic inequalities that are evident at a very early age.  Indeed, studies have consistently shown that childhood overweight and obesity is more heavily concentrated in lower socio-economic status, SES, households.<\/p> <p>  Although there is some tentative evidence that rates of childhood overweight and obesity may have stabilised in recent years in some high income countries, this trend has not occurred at an equal pace across all socio-economic groups.  Data from the Growing Up in Ireland infant cohort shows that 9% of children from lower secondary educated maternal backgrounds are obese at three years of age compared with 4% of children from degree educated maternal backgrounds.  This means that by the time they arrive at the door of the preschool to avail of the Government&rsquo;s early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, children from lower SES backgrounds are already 16% more likely to be overweight and 2.3 times more likely to be obese compared with their higher SES peers.  Moreover, the data tells us that these socio-economic inequalities continue to widen thereafter.  By 13 years of age, shortly after they have made the transition to secondary school, children from lower SES backgrounds are 56% more likely to be overweight and 3.5 times more likely to be obese.  There are no differences in body mass index, BMI, at time of birth but children from lower SES backgrounds will weigh approximately 1 kg\/m2 heavier by 13 years of age.  This is huge at the population level.<\/p> <p>  Our analysis of longitudinal patterns indicates that children from lower SES backgrounds are more likely to be overweight or obese at any age, or are more likely to become overweight or obese if previously non-overweight and are more likely to maintain overweight or obese status over time.  This means that children from lower SES backgrounds are quite literally carrying around a heavier burden of disease from much earlier in the life course.  In fact, recent evidence suggests excess adiposity represents a major pathway through which social inequality gets underneath the skin to precipitate earlier morbidity and mortality among more disadvantaged groups.  These findings reinforce the necessity of challenging the childhood obesity epidemic at early ages because our analysis has shown that these patterns are difficult to change once they become entrenched.<\/p> <p>  We need to urgently address the material, structural and cultural factors that contribute to the emergence of these inequalities in early life.  International research, including our own, suggests that the period from infancy extending through early childhood is a critical one for growth and development.  Our research with the Growing Up in Ireland infant cohort shows that children from semi-skilled or unskilled social class backgrounds weigh 135g lighter at time of birth compared with children from professional social class backgrounds, but experience more rapid weight gain thereafter to the extent that they weigh 250g more by three years of age.  Factors contributing to this pattern of rapid weight gain in the first nine months of life include: earlier transition to solid foods - before six months of age; lower rates of breastfeeding, which has been shown to be protective against the development of obesity; and prenatal tobacco smoke exposure.<\/p> <p>  Factors associated with rapid weight gain between nine and three years of age include lower dietary quality, higher maternal BMI and higher levels of television watching, all of which are socio-economically patterned.  Statistical adjustment for this constellation of risk factors, that is, early infant nutrition, maternal prenatal behaviours and child diet and lifestyle fully explain the class differentials that exist in regard to childhood obesity at three years of age.<\/p><p>Importantly, these risk factors are all modifiable which means we can do something about this and it represents an opportunity to intervene and reduce the riskier body mass trajectories of lower SES groups.<\/p><p> It is important that we understand the socio-cultural context in which these social inequalities emerge.  Studies of household food purchases generally report a positive association between household SES and the quality and variety of purchased foods.  International evidence suggests that high quality diets are more expensive than low quality diets and that those on low incomes are more sensitive to the cost of food.  The introduction of the recent sugar tax may lead to a reduction in unhealthy food consumption, but strategies are also needed on the other side to encourage consumption of nutritive dense foods.<\/p><p> Breastfeeding has been shown to be protective against the development of obesity.  We have previously shown that being breastfed for a period of six months or more is associated with a 49% reduction in the risk of obesity at three years of age and a 51% reduction in the risk of obesity at nine years of age.  Women from lower SES backgrounds are 80% less likely to breastfeed.  Measures to increase breastfeeding rates should be a national priority and resources should be allocated to increase breastfeeding rates among more disadvantaged groups.  This will involve a commitment to substantially increase the level and provision of support for breastfeeding in Ireland, in addition to providing a sufficient level of central funding to help achieve this goal.<\/p><p> Let me repeat that one in four three year olds is now overweight or obese.  Of the older Irish population, 80% are now overweight or obese according to figures provided by the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA.  Ireland is on target to be the fattest country in Europe by 2030 according to the World Health Organization.  We need to act urgently to address this problem.  We know that the factors contributing to the increase in childhood overweight and obesity are multitudinous and that solutions will have to be multifaceted.  Tackling it will require co-ordinated action across a number of Government Departments and the involvement of stakeholders, including parents, schools, community-based organisations, healthcare providers, and the private and public sectors.<\/p><p> We recommend that the Government: makes a political commitment to tackling childhood obesity and to developing an action plan to achieve this; implements a national screening program for BMI and waist circumference in school-age children on an annual basis; sets national targets for the reduction of childhood obesity and an evaluation programme for monitoring success of this goal; establishes clear targets for reducing socio-economic inequalities in childhood obesity; and considers the use of targeted intervention initiatives for high-risk groups particularly those of low socio-economic status.  I thank the committee members for their time and wish them well in their important work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal McCrory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525249800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Dr. Mc Crory.

Under its horticulture remit, Bord Bia manages and oversees implementation of the Food Dudes programme.  This is led by myself in my role as director of meat and horticulture in Bord Bia.  While the specific task of tackling obesity is not within the remit of Bord Bia, it is widely accepted that a healthy balanced diet with fruit and vegetables at its core is a key contributor in reducing and minimising obesity levels.  As such the Food Dudes programme can play a role in supporting programmes aimed specifically at obesity, such as the Healthy Ireland schools initiatives.<\/p> <p>  The Food Dudes programme is an evidence-based, incentivised behaviour changing programme which was developed by Professor Fergus Lowe in Bangor University in Wales and aims to encourage increased consumption of fruit and vegetables by primary school children by changing attitudes and cultivating a liking for fruit and vegetables.  The programme is managed by Bord Bia and receives financial support from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the European Union through the European school fruit and vegetable scheme.<\/p> <p>  It is based on three core principles which are called the three Rs which are: repeated tasting of raw fruit and vegetables which cultivates a liking for fruit and vegetables; role models which take the form of cartoon characters called the Food Dudes; and rewards, which are small prizes which incentivise the school children to take part and eat the fruit and vegetables over a number of days.<\/p> <p>  Through the programme portions fruit and vegetable portions are provided to primary school children over an intervention period of just 16 consecutive school days, which is called phase 1 of the programme.  The graph, which is my opening statement, shows the current range of produce currently being provided to children in primary schools.<\/p> <p>  Supporting materials such as consumption diaries, a DVD of the Food Dude superheroes and some prizes, and there is a graph of these in my opening statement which the committee has.  Certificates and school room wall charts are also provided to maintain fruit and vegetable consumption in the longer term.  After the initial 16 days of produce delivery, phase 2 of the programme commences, which sees the focus switch specifically to the home and this runs for a number of weeks.  This is where the parents become heavily involved.  It sees children bringing in their own fruit and vegetable portions from home in specially provided Food Dudes lunchboxes which are distributed at the end of phase 1, the first 16 days of the programme.<\/p> <p>  The Food Dudes Boost programme was introduced in 2015.  It maintains all the key elements of the original programme but uses fewer rewards and has a stronger focus on the junior cycle - that is, the new children coming into the school - ensuring that the programme can reach more children in a school year.  How the programme is implemented in schools is detailed in my written statement to the committee, which was forwarded to it.<\/p> <p>  The Food Dudes programme has been evaluated a number of times.  All evaluations showed that the Food Dudes programme effectively increased fruit and vegetables consumption among its target group and that a sustained pattern of eating more fruit and vegetables was established among participating school children.  The most recent evaluation was carried out in 2016 by an expert team from UCD and evaluated the long-term impact of the programme on schools that participated in the programme as far back as 2010 and 2011.  The results showed that the number of senior pupils bringing and consuming fruit and vegetables, remained significantly higher than before the Food Dudes intervention back in 2010 and 2011.<\/p> <p>  An interesting finding that emerged from the evaluation is that consumption rates were high both at baseline but remained high at follow-up when increased portions were brought.  This suggests that the majority of children ate what was provided in their lunchboxes even when additional portions of fruit and vegetables were provided at follow-up.  This underpins and highlights the importance of parental influence on children&rsquo;s eating practices in school.<\/p> <p>  As part of the EU development of a single school scheme, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has submitted a six year strategy to the EU for delivering Food Dudes through the EU school scheme.  The strategy includes a period of pilot testing over the next two school years of some new elements and activities that might supplement the core elements of Food Dudes, which are primarily based around the consumption of produce.  In future years, this will include activities such as gardening, healthy eating days or weeks and project work on healthy eating around online activities, sport-linked activities, etc.  It is envisaged that the additional aspects will be particularly relevant to senior class children.  The prime motivation and criterion of success will remain the increased consumption of fruit and vegetables.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1525249800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Neary.  <\/p><p>I take this opportunity to welcome our other contributors this morning - Ms Aidine O'Reilly, managing director of Real Nation, and Mr. D.O.

We know that Super Troopers works.  Independent research carried out by the health psychologist Professor David Hevey from Trinity College Dublin has found that the programme has been successful in improving healthy behaviours among families.  I will briefly outline some of the research findings.  We can share the findings of much more research with members, if they wish.  It found that 93% of parents had confirmed an increase in children's daily activity levels; 85% of parents had observed increased physical activity at home; 75% of parents had indicated that their child spoke more about his or her feelings; 63% of parents had indicated that their children were eating more fruit and vegetables; and 86% of teachers and 78% of parents had indicated that they would recommend the programme.  Almost half of primary schools take part in Super Troopers and our ambition is to extend the programme to all primary schools.  We hope we have given members a sense of what it entails and will be pleased to answer their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. D.O.

At least then we could say there was time to do it in the school environment and that everyone would be measured.  If it were done through general practice, some children might attend their general practitioner three or four times per annum, while others might attend only once or not at all, which means that we might not see them and would not know how they were progressing.  I work with datasets from other countries.  In Portugal, for example, a child is measured every time he or she visits a general practitioner.

The reality is that it is easier and cheaper to eat badly.  It is much easier to buy a frozen pizza from Lidl than it is to buy fresh vegetables and fruit.  Also, in rural areas there might be only one local shop so options are limited.  We also need to consider how snack-type foods are marketed.  When one enters any garage one will see signs claiming two for the price of one or two for &euro;1 when it comes to confectionery.  It takes more effort to find healthy snacks and, unfortunately, they are less appealing, particularly to children.  Healthy snacks are always more expensive.  We need to address these matters.  It is all well and good introducing a sugar tax.  The reality is people do not want to eat badly but one's finances, etc. are limited if one has a large family and one resorts to convenience foods.<\/p> <p>  Eating healthily comes down to the approach adopted by the family and a parent or parents.  I have children and I know about the food programmes rolled out in schools called Super Troopers and Food Dudes.  I am lucky that the school my children attend is so strict about implementing a healthy eating policy that children can never bring in any type of a snack.  That situation can be frustrating when one is trying to think of a new item for children to eat at lunchtime in school.  My children tell me that they are not allowed to eat snacks, which shows one can change the mentality of children.  <\/p> <p>  I suggest that healthy eating be promoted as part of antenatal care.  The majority of people will avail of the public health system for maternity services and I know the service is extremely overstretched at present.  One is offered antenatal classes during the first pregnancy.  I suggest that a mother's well-being is promoted and that women are provided with information on the best foods to consume during pregnancy, when the baby is born and at all the various stages.  When parents bring their toddler into a shop it is easier to buy him or her a packet of snacks to pacify the child rather than buy fruit.  Most of this issue concerns trying to change the mindset.  People do not see the long-term damage.  Obviously the more sugar one has the more people will want it and all of the rest.  I suggest that a programme is run in conjunction with antenatal classes.  A little of that information is imparted at checks performed by public health nurses but it is very limited.  I suggest that the nutritional aspect of the scheme is increased.  I am interested in hearing the opinions of the witnesses on those areas.  If my suggestion was implemented then people would benefit from an early age.  If schools continue the good work with the healthy lunch policy then everyone will have a better chance of being healthy.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050200002#J01000","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525249800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I want to comment on the cost of food, which is an issue that was discussed outside of this meeting a minute ago.<\/p> <p>  I work very closely with the horticultural industry.

One of the big challenges is a lack of cooking skills, which we have seen in some research.  This issue is more complex.  One must have the confidence to buy produce, know how to prepare it, have the time to prepare it and to cook same.  As well as the financial side, we can do more.

I know, as a parent, that sometimes children are conscious of their weight and they may already be anxious about their weight.  Would a screening programme place greater pressure on children?

In terms of parents not recognising overweight or obesity in their children, I think what has happened is when one tends to get a shift to the right in BMI distribution, and that has happened at a societal level so, on average, we, as a society, are heavier now than we were ten years ago.  It is also most likely that we, as a society, will be heavier again in another ten years as weight gain continues to go unchecked.  As people start to gain weight they stop seeing it.  If all of one's peers are moving in the same direction one just stops seeing it.  As I said, 54% of parents of overweight children could not see it in their children.  Let us remember that I am referring to objective measurements that used the body mass index, BMI.  The parents thought their children were about the right weight.  Also, of the 20% of children who were obese, their parents said they were about the right weight.  That suggests that the parents did not recognise the problem in their children.  Possibly, that is because one tends to find that the nutrients for children and parents correlate, for the most part.  Also, overweight parents might not like to think of themselves as overweight and, therefore, might be less likely to see the same in their children.  I gleaned that information from the research conducted on almost 10,000 children as part of the Growing Up in Ireland study.<\/p> <p>  In terms of breastfeeding, the economic inequalities are stark.  Ireland is very bad when it comes to breastfeeding in general, and that applies right across society.  We talked about the setting of targets and missing targets.  In 2005, a national breastfeeding strategy was developed that sought to increase breastfeeding rates by 2% per annum and, within disadvantaged socio-economic groups, we sought to increase it by 4% per annum.  Who has evaluated the success of those goals?  I can tell the committee, from work conducted by Professor Anne Nolan in the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, that the increase in the incidence of breastfeeding in this country has been driven mostly by migrant mothers who are much more likely to breastfeed.  By the shift to the right, in terms of the age at which mothers are having their first children, older mothers are more likely to breastfeed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050200002#J01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal McCrory"},{"type":"speech","time":1525249800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Why do so few women choose to breastfeed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050200002#J01600","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525249800,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Part of the reason is a loss of knowledge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050200002#J01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cathal McCrory"},{"type":"speech","time":1525249800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Another reason is that there is zero support at the hospital level given to first-time mothers.

Thankfully, society is losing this but we need to continue to challenge the idea that there is something wrong with breastfeeding one's child.  Breastfeeding is normative.  We need to promote the message that breastfeeding is normative.  The evidence seems to suggest that breastfeeding is best for the child not just in the context of obesity.  It reduces the risk of respiratory infections and so on.  A bond develops with the mother and child as a result of breastfeeding.  The evidence shows that if the grandmother of the child has breastfed, the mother is 237% more likely to breastfeed.  That reinforces the importance of the knowledge.  It is having the knowledge within families and we need to develop that.  The baby-friendly hospitals initiative, or at least, the work we did with Growing Up in Ireland, suggested that by the time a woman left hospital, if she was in a baby-friendly hospital, she was more likely to breastfeed at this juncture.  It was not sustained so that shows that we need to continue to support breastfeeding beyond that initial 48 or 72-hour window until a lady is discharged from hospital.  It was with concern that I noted that the baby-friendly hospital initiative has ceased.  Funding for that has been withdrawn.

I was really taken aback when they spoke about the stigma around breastfeeding.  Could they elaborate on the reasons for that?  I am reading bits and pieces about it such as isolation, the fear of continued isolation and not being able to go out.  It is a subject about which I do not have knowledge and I work a lot in the mental health area.  I put my hands up, which is why I asked the question.<\/p> <p>  I agree about foods.  I can only speak for myself.  I do not have kids but even when I walk into a store and try to find a healthy snack without sugar or less sugar, I find it extremely difficult.  I am searching for ten or 15 minutes and I am not a kid.  I am not a parent with the weight of three or four kids hanging off them, having to get to school or dealing with lunch boxes or whatever it is - all those weights on top on them.  Frequently, it is about convenience.  It is about trying to get something fast and convenient.  Much of that is around education.  It is also about the market.  The market just does not have it.  I go into stores that just do not have it.  They are not providing it.  In respect of Deputy Funchion's point, probably lower-income parents in particular walk in looking for the best value for money for their budget when they have three kids.  Number one, it is legal.  It is in the shops so it must be okay in some way.  It is being bought.  It is not cigarettes or alcohol.  It is food.  That is probably the psychology behind it.  The second thing is that for a certain amount of money, a person can get \"X\" amount of it, which is great because it will feed so many people over so many days and can be preserved because it will last in a fridge or freezer as opposed to fresh fruit and vegetables, which are quite perishable and go off.  The time it takes to prepare food is another factor.  All these weights are bearing down on people when they are making their decisions so it goes back to consumer buyer behaviour.  <\/p> <p>  Have there been any studies around consumer behaviour and how that can be educated or altered when people make these decisions in the supermarket or shop given all the added pressures they face?  This is not coming from the days of old.  One could ask whether this is about the mollycoddled generation and how everything has been done for them.  It is not that.  It is just that the pressure is different.  Pressures are fluid so the environment changes.  What was there 30 or 40 years ago was very different from the pressures that are there today.  They had pressures as well but they were different types of pressures.  Are there studies around that because I do not know about putting a sugar tax on confectionery, any of these types of foods or processed foods like burgers because everything will rise together because there is not enough choice out there?  This will not help less well-off people.  I thinking about less well-off or vulnerable families who have to make these quick decisions but who do not have that space to do it.

One of the most controversial subjects at the moment is whether a healthier diet costs more than an unhealthy one.  People have debated whether a healthy diet has to cost more than an unhealthy one.  A meta-analysis of 27 studies across ten countries by researchers from Harvard University in 2013 showed that the cost of a healthy diet was $1.50 more per day than an unhealthy diet.  If one scales that up to an individual over a year, it adds up to $550 and if one scales that up to two parents with two children, all of a sudden, one is talking about a difference of $2,000 per annum in terms of eating a healthy diet.<\/p><p>It costs more to eat a healthy diet.  I am aware that other people have argued that it does not cost more, but the available evidence seems to suggest that it does.  An evaluation exercise, as carried out by two other researchers called Darmon and Drewnowski, looked at the price of all foods in France and put the numbers into a computer system.  They looked at the recommendations for a nutritionally-balanced diet and used a technique called linear programming to generate a nutritional diet for this amount of food.  They found that &euro;3.50 per day was the lowest amount of money that could be spent while ensuring a nutritionally-balanced diet.  When they compared that to what people in France are spending on food in low-income households, the most they could afford was &euro;2.50.  The programme could not crunch enough to allow them a balanced diet at that price.  We speak regularly about how we can get people to eat healthy diets, but we have to recognise that cost is a huge factor.  Another study conducted by <i>safe<\/i>food in 2010-11 suggested that for people on welfare budgets, to eat a healthy diet costs approximately 25% of their income, while they spent 19% to 20% of their income on food.  It does cost more, and we need to be aware of that.  <br\/><br\/>In many low socio-economic status, SES, households, food is considered to be a flexible part of the budget.  If one has utility bills, rent and car bills, what gives?  Sometimes the food budget gives a little bit more because it is considered more flexible, and people might end up making poorer choices in terms of their diet.  They might make sense to the person because he or she has a restricted budget available, but they might not make sense to a more affluent person who tells the poorer person what to eat.  We need to be aware of the context in which that advice is given. <br\/><br\/>Research from the &quot;Growing Up in Ireland&quot; study shows that lower SES households are located further from supermarkets.  We know that convenience stores offer restricted choice.  Going into a shop to look for a healthy snack was mentioned.

The grocery market in Ireland is worth about &euro;10 billion a year, and &euro;1.5 billion of that is spent on fresh produce.  Bord Bia is most interested in the fruit and vegetable element of that.  We are told to aim for a diet which includes five or seven portions of fruit and vegetables a day, and frozen vegetables or canned vegetables count towards that.

However, as Dr. McCrory says, it tends to be a little bit more expensive, so one pays for the convenience.  The products are there, but it comes back to the consumer's wish to buy it.  It comes down to education.  It must be said it gets more difficult to change behaviour or change habits as we get older.  Can we change the habits at a young age, and try to carry that through life?  That is a big challenge.  It is a choice.  People go into supermarkets and make a choice to select healthy, convenient products, with price also factored in.  It will be a challenge going forward.  Many products available now are marketed as innovative products and many companies are bringing out health-related food products, be it gluten free, high in fibre or high in certain vitamins.  That ties into the fact that consumers want a healthier diet, but it comes down to the convenience and affordability of same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mike Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1525249800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I would use the word \"knowledge\" as opposed to \"education\".

I do not want to force a societal issue on one group of individuals, but I believe retailers have a role to play in this, in terms of trying to promote healthier eating.  In the last committee hearing on obesity a number of weeks ago it was mentioned that one or two of the multiples, in my experience, had incredibly colourful displays of fresh produce, including fruit and vegetables, as one walks into their store as a rule.  In order to enter the store one had to pass all of the fruit and vegetables.  However, there was then a change of ownership and that policy changed and it was suddenly half the entrance, then it got smaller again.  The fruit and vegetable display has got bigger again in recent months.  The retailer might have a role to play during that three minutes a person has standing behind someone at a deli counter at lunchtime.  Can they do something about the options that are displayed above one's head?  In many bigger stores they are visual choices.  Do the witnesses have a view on the retailers playing their part by offering visual choices that are actually healthy as opposed to a fridge display unit resplendent with all sorts of products that have tons of mayonnaise thrown in on top of them, as opposed to the things they have never tried that they might equally like.  That is just one observation, on foot of what Deputy Neville had to say.<\/p> <p>  Dr. McCrory, at the outset of the conversation, remarked that 19% of children aged three are overweight and 6% are obese, which is a shocking statistic.  I imagine that the Chairman of the Committee on Health ten years ago would have been greeted with a lower figure but one that was heading to the level we have now reached.  Perhaps, as Dr. McCrory pointed out, we will have another report unless we arrest this issue now.  It is very clear to me, given the programmes that the other guests today present to primary schools, that education is of absolute importance.  As Deputy Neville has quite rightly said, knowledge via public awareness campaigns rather than just education is great at changing mindsets.<\/p><p>That certainly worked for me.  The witnesses referred to BMI.  I worked out my own BMI.  People probably would not guess it and it is not very healthy.  My BMI is 28 because of my height.  BMI does not work for me and never has because I have always been heavy and tall.  For someone of an average height, however, BMI is a good barometer.  Returning to the figure of 19%.  As someone put it to me, a three year old does not come home from work at 6.15 p.m. and say \"Feck it, I'll order a takeaway\" and the three year old does not do the weekly shop.  I am the father of a six year old and a four year old.  It is parents who have ultimate responsibility in this area.<\/p><p> Bord Bia is funded by the State, whereas Laya is not.  My view is that if this issue is to be arrested, the State must pay for it.  Senator Noone mentioned the sugar tax earlier.  I would go further.  I am not a big proponent of sugar tax but if we are going to do it, we should do it properly and also look at fatty produce, sugar-sweetened drinks and all the various things that we find convenient and hence consume in large volumes.  I would also like to see the State subsidise, in equal measure, healthy food produce.  We have already seen the effect of the tax on sugar-sweetened drinks.  Outside one of the very first of these meetings, I mentioned the question of the sugar tax to the Minister for Finance.  He told me it had been delayed but it was already having a fantastic effect because they are all changing their formula.  It is not about revenue raising but about changing mindsets.  Nevertheless, if it is to raise revenue, whether it is &euro;5 or &euro;10 million, then we should put that into healthy eating, for example, the consumption of vegetables.  We could subsidise prepared convenience vegetables that have been washed, diced, sliced and so on.  Then a diced carrot could be similar in price to, if not cheaper than, a carrot.  The one that has been diced would obviously have been handled and chopped so there are costs associated with that.  Although ring-fencing is a much-used term in politics but rarely put into effect, I would love to see the moneys from the sugar tax ring-fenced for the production of healthy convenience food or towards subsidising it.<\/p><p> I turn now to the healthy programmes run by the Department of Education and Skills.  The Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Education and Skills may part fund these and the witnesses noted that 40% of the funding comes from the EU.  Is there an educational programme in the Department of Education and Skills specifically targeted at primary schoolchildren?  Are the witnesses part of that or is it an overarching Government approach which has Bord Bia working on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2018050200002#L00600","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525249800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>The programme is our way of implementing the European school fruit and vegetable scheme, which comes under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Obesity is not the point where we, as an organisation, would start from, but rather trying to increase the consumption of fresh produce, that is, fruit and vegetables, it just happens that it is complementary to the issue of tackling obesity because it is a key part of a balanced, healthy diet.  We are using the funding available from Europe and nationally to double the benefit.  We have closely consulted the Department of Health and other Departments in how we shape and develop the programme and how it can evolve and be built in order that is integrated.  We are also part of the Healthy Ireland initiative network.  We are one part of the overall effort.  On an everyday basis, our starting point is in promoting produce in the context of where it will have that benefit.<\/p> <p>  Funding is critical.  None of these schemes is cheap to run, but one must look down the road at the costs if these schemes were not in place.  Close to 50% of the funding comes from a European fund.

We need to make the programme as effective as possible, get it into as many schools as possible and ensure that as many children as possible are exposed to it on an ongoing basis.

There are different challenges in each of the groups.  Knowledge is critical.  We also do a lot of this among adults where there is a slightly different approach.  When we talk about the healthy diet, our approach is one of encouraging people to eat healthily two days a week, rather than seven days, or to encourage people to start off with one day a week, to choose brown bread over white or porridge over cereal.  In middle class families, when a child who has his or her own money goes into a store to make a choice, we would encourage him or her to buy an apple or a banana rather than a bar of chocolate.  The approach is about educating people about making those simple choices, giving them the power and knowledge to make those simple decisions and choose those habits.

Without that funding over the number of years, while the EU money built up, the programme would not be where it is today, so it should be acknowledged that we have secured some good funding from the Department as well and it has helped us to leverage much more money from the European Union.

As members know, Mental Health Ireland, MHI, has already made a previous written submission on a number themes such as mental health primary care, staff recruitment and funding.  I understand today's session is to look at the area of health promotion and early intervention.<\/p> <p>  Mental Health Ireland is a national voluntary body and our mission is to promote positive mental health for individuals and communities through our network of 82 local mental health associations operated by volunteers.  We support people who experience mental health difficulties on their journey to recovery.  Our vision is of an Ireland where mental health is valued as an essential part of personal well-being and the health of the nation.  MHI leads the way in terms of society&rsquo;s understanding of mental health and fostering a culture where people with mental health difficulties are respected and supported.  Our work at a national level is supported by the Health Service Executive under a number of formal service level arrangements and these specify common objectives and quantums of service.  Mental Health Ireland was founded following a commission of inquiry in 1966.  The report recognised that people were recovering and moving from mental hospitals.  At that time there was a need to promote positive mental health and community understanding of mental health issues and also to provide practical support for service users.<\/p> <p>  In Mental Health Ireland, we envisage an Ireland where all of our people have a better understanding of their own mental health and its needs, the factors that improve and the factors that can compromise their quality of life and mental health.  We recognise that mental health needs to be reviewed and understood as a resource for life, where people have access to programmes that can help develop their skills and strategies for dealing with family life and daily life.  These should be readily available throughout the community.  We support a model where there should be an openness to discuss mental health issues among family, friends, and peers and where there is a sense of connectedness.  This is vital to a sense of belonging and is protective of our mental health.  As Irish citizens, we need to have confidence in health services, to feel they are available to us, that they are appealing and accessible and ultimately treatment will be successful.  It is important that as people use services or following their use of services, they do not have a sense of alienation or being removed from their community in any way.  It is important that positive mental health and well-being enjoys the same profile and parity as physical health.<\/p> <p>  Over the past 50 years mental health association volunteers and our affiliated partners have engaged actively in mental health promotion right across the country.  This is closely aligned to a vision of a more positive Ireland where personal well-being, health and economic success are all recognised as of equal value.  We see the importance of promoting positive mental health in an evidence based way.  We want to strengthen our efforts to promote the protective factors and reduce the risk factors and prevent mental illness to move towards a more flourishing and inclusive society.  We understand that we have certain strengths in this field in terms of our long commitment and our relationship with communities right across the country.  We have our own dedicated mental health department, we are building upon that and Ms Aisling Doherty has joined us here today.  The model is that we would be in a position to adopt best practice in Ireland, learn from international colleagues and academic research and make this available to communities right throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  Over the years of our organisation the question has changed somewhat from \"what is mental health?\" to \"how do I care for my own mental health?\".  Having begun this conversation over 50 years ago we feel a responsibility to advance that dialogue further and to deepen it.  We work with many NGOs right across the sector to do so.<\/p> <p>  We see promoting positive mental health and well-being on three different levels.  It is about building on strengthening the individual to improve emotional resilience through various interventions designed to promote self esteem and self efficacy,  strengthening communities in terms of having an inclusive and participative community where neighbourhoods and environments are designed to be conducive to mental health and also reducing any structural barriers that still remain and we will talk about these in today's session.  It is about reducing elements like discrimination and stigma and making sure people have access to meaningful education, employment opportunities and housing.  We support people at a vulnerable time in their lives and that has been a continuing role.  We are aware that there can be a lot of well intentioned activity in this space.  While that can demonstrate a collective concern or a societal solidarity, we need to move beyond simple awareness.  This is why mental health promotion needs to have the same robust evidence base and have a credibility, as with any other form of health promotion.<\/p><p> At Mental Health Ireland we have been delivering evidence-based services.  This is why we are working further in this field and commissioning further research so that we have a much better understanding of what are successful interventions and why they are successful. <\/p><p> International research suggests that there are about seven principles we really need to be active on in order to succeed in mental health promotion.  One is around empowerment.  This facilitates individuals and communities to take greater control of their own decisions, health behaviours and life choices.  This must be well-informed for it to show understanding and for us to have confidence in it.  <\/p><p> Another important value is participation, meaning that all stakeholders play a much more active role in decision-making.  This has been an issue in the past for many mental health service users.  We are very heavily involved in working in the recovery space, especially in the area of co-production, where service users, family members and professionals collaborate in a more positive way.  <\/p><p> We need to have equitable access.  This is discussion that will come up later.  There are quite limited resources in the mental health space, but are they evenly distributed?  Equitable access means that there is equal access for all our citizens throughout the country to the resources that are available.  <\/p><p> MHI supports an inter-sectoral approach.  There is a recognition that mental health is not the sole preserve of any one component or agency, and we are very well positioned to work across different disciplines.  We are working across a spectrum, with housing agencies, local sports, arts and cultural communities so that we can touch people's lives in a positive way.  Working in health promotion, particularly mental health promotion, it is very important to carry out sustainable interventions and not just once-off actions.  These need to have follow-through if the benefits are to be realised and sustained.  <\/p><p> Another important principle is that the approach needs to be holistic, and not just working with the individual in one domain.  Embracing people's physical health, mental health, social health and indeed spiritual health are really important if they are to enjoy full, happy and healthy lives in conducive communities.  Finally, it is really important that we have a multi-strategy stance, so that there is no single approach that will be effective.  Each of these enhances the other when they work in combination.  <\/p><p> In Mental Health Ireland, our work is guided by the Healthy Ireland strategy, and by chapter 5 of A Vision for Change.  Unfortunately, this is perhaps the shortest chapter in A Vision for Change, but it has very important points to make.  It is a little overlooked that in Ireland we are at a key point in our history regarding the demographic shape and profile of our population.  Some 23% of our population are children, so there is a real opportunity here and a closing window that we need to grasp in laying down positive life events and life approaches to build resilience.  It is something that we really need to tend to very quickly.  <\/p><p> In A Vision for Change the authors identify four different areas of priority including promoting positive mental health and well-being; raising awareness of the importance of mental health; enhancing capacity of mental health service providers and the general community to promote positive mental  health, an area in which Mental Health Ireland has been actively involved; and suicide prevention, which is also an area of activity for our organisation.  It also points to the need to build capacity to promote mental health in an effective manner that is robust and is evidence-based.  That is certainly an area of focus for our organisation.<\/p><p> In regard to early intervention, which the committee is keen to explore today, the role of primary care is really important in mental health.  Our written submission reflects this aspect.  There are about 5.6 million occasions of care in Ireland in a year.  Some 35% of all GP interventions relate to mental health issues.  Not everyone recognises their GP or their family practice as a place where they can receive help.  However, 90% of mental health issues can be effectively recognised and resolved successfully in primary care, with 10% of service users being referred forward to specialist community-based mental health services.  There is a network of day hospitals and community mental health centres throughout Ireland, and this really should be the first point of referral for GPs.  It is important that it should happen that way.  <\/p><p> There are a number of factors that can delay referral and the acceptance of support in the mental health space.  These can include the costs of service; its availability; geographic isolation; historical stigma and prejudice; negative perception of service; and perhaps the most limiting factor of all, hopelessness, where the individual does not believe that a successful intervention is possible.  This belief limits a person's ability to step forward in a timely and effective way.  It is important that we address these barriers, some of which are more pronounced for certain cohorts of the population.  For young people the foremost difficulty may be cost.  Men are sometimes reluctant to accept that they need help, and perhaps feel vulnerable at a certain time of their lives.  There is also a tendency for people to minimise their difficulties, or indeed to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol.  If we are to be successful in early intervention in Ireland, we need to have a much better understanding of help-seeking, help-finding and help-accepting behaviours.  I note that the last of these is critical to successful mental health care.<\/p><p> We know that people with quite significant mental health needs can be reluctant to engage with services.  Sometimes they fear a loss of independence or control of decision-making.  They may feel that the relationship has something of a power imbalance.  That needs to be revisited.  This is why Mental Health Ireland has been working very closely with people with self-experience throughout the country to create roles for peer educators and peer workers.  We have also been active in a collaboration with the HSE entitled advancing recovery in Ireland.  These actions are intended to ensure that people who use services are very active not just in their own care and treatment, but also in designing models for others.  Certainly the whole area of co-production is one about which we need to hear a lot more.   <\/p><p> In discussing the importance of recovery, we need to understand that in the past, gaining access to mental health services was not always the issue.  Gaining egress and leaving the service was a much greater challenge.  In 1960 in Ireland, 23% of the entire health budget was dedicated to mental health spending.  I began my career in 1983; in 1984, this percentage of health spending had dropped to 12%.  The World Health Organization, WHO, recommends that 12% is the minimal threshold.  If a mental health service is to be provided, 12% is the minimal standard.  When A Vision for Change was published in 2006, a target for this figure was set at 8.4%, significantly below the WHO recommendation.  Sl&aacute;intecare, an excellent report published last year, recommends 10%, still below the WHO's recommended norm.  We know that the last ten years have been a really difficult decade for the Irish public.  There has been unprecedented growth in the demand for mental health services.  Mental health spending is currently 6.4% of health spending.  If it is going to be so low, it is really important that resources are evenly distributed right throughout country and available to all of our citizens equally.  This is why recovery is such an important topic, certainly when we are talking about prevention and early intervention.  If people are to avail of the mental health services, it is also important that they successfully leave the mental health services.  They must be able to reposition themselves into community living and get back into their whole lives, be that in education, family, community or employment, and live full lives again.  <\/p><p> Mental Health Ireland's mission involves working with people to ensure that they successfully make their way back into their communities and fully reintegrate by not living in a psychiatric model within the community setting, but fully availing of community life.  In 1950, around the time our organisation was established, Ireland had the highest rate of hospitalisation in the world.  There were 22,000 of our citizens living in psychiatric hospitals, with little prospect of return.  Our volunteers throughout the country have been very active in ensuring that people have a way back to their communities, and that they can succeed in that pathway.  <\/p><p> We also know that a huge level of hospitalisation created a very graphic image in the public mind.  This is often quite a hopeless message regarding people's ability to recover and their likelihood of doing so.  As a national organisation and through our volunteers and mental health associations throughout the country, Mental Health Ireland has been working to ensure that people succeed in returning to their community, are celebrated and feel absolutely accepted in that space.  This is a really vital role and it absolutely wraps around our need to promote positive mental health in a much more effective manner, and to intervene early so that lifelong disability, distress, and unnecessary risk is not realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Rogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I would like to express my thanks to the Deputies, Senators and Chairperson, on behalf of the SpunOut.ie team, for the invitation to address the committee today.  As Ireland&rsquo;s youth information website, run by young people for young people, SpunOut.ie meets the information needs of over 140,000 young people each month.<\/p> <p>  One of our largest and most pressing areas of concern is youth mental health, where for over a decade we have acted as a trusted signpost to specialist services and as a non-judgmental provider of essential information services.  In this role, we have developed a clear understanding not only of the general needs of our national mental health services, but crucially of where those gaps in the system have hurt young people the most.  It is welcome that the committee has chosen to seek specialist information from the youth work sector.  I hope our contribution today can go a way towards improving the future of mental healthcare, in particular for those whose futures are placed most at risk both by chronic underfunding and a lack of early intervention. <\/p> <p>  The fact that prevention is better than any cure is more than old clich&eacute;.  It should be at heart of everything we do when it comes to mental health.  Three quarters of all serious mental health difficulties start to present when a person is aged between 15 and 25.<\/p><p>It is at those ages that properly funded mental health interventions are not just crucial but, in actual fact, irreplaceable for ensuring long-term mental wellness.<br\/><br\/>There is enormous demand for accessible early intervention services for young people that charities, NGOs and acute services simply cannot satisfy on the basis of current levels of investment.  I was encouraged to see the committee consider a recommendation that mental health spending be increased to 12% of the health budget.  However, we have to bear in mind that even the 8.2 % figure set out in A Vision for Change has yet to be met.  For all the talk of mental health as a political priority in 21st century Ireland, we remain far below the 13%, or even 23%, figure we managed in the 1980s, as mentioned by my colleague.<br\/><br\/>I say this to underline a simple truth, namely, that while we may advocate specific policy changes or reallocation of resources in isolation, without a meaningful and sustained increase in overall levels of funding, we will not be able to tackle the mental health crisis in our society.  We should make no mistake; there is a crisis.  The most recent EUROSTAT figures released last month put our youth suicide rate of males and females at seventh worst in the EU.  Meanwhile, we continue to spend less than half of the percentage of our nearest neighbours in the UK.  We need to build a consensus around funding services that work and can make early effective interventions that can have enormous positive impacts on individuals and communities.<br\/><br\/>There is a wide acceptance, informed by the work of the WHO and others, that the overwhelming majority of mental health interventions should take place in primary care.  Therefore, any plan for the future of mental health services must have quicker, easier access to psychology in primary care at its core.  The recent decision to appoint 100 new assistant psychologists makes for a welcome start.  However, the apparent global shortage of mental health clinicians makes it more challenging than ever to attract the skilled professionals we need, especially in the context of services in rural areas.<br\/><br\/>The Seanad Public Consultation Committee has pointed out how, even as international competition for trained mental health professionals intensifies, we have not seen any steps taken to improve pay and conditions in the sector.  This has been true not just within primary care but also for acute services, such as child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  In mentioning CAMHS, I am reminded of the ongoing work in which we at SpunOut<i><\/i>are engaged in helping to build public awareness and understanding of that service.  In choosing to partner with us, those involved in CAMHS have recognised the indispensable role of clear and engaging information provision in ensuring appropriate and effective mental health interventions.  Moving forward, we would hope that CAMHS will receive the resources they need to create a truly accessible service.<br\/><br\/>Also of note and to be welcomed is the mental health digital and telephone support project, which is wisely exploring the possibilities of publicly provided, evidence-based ICT mental health supports so young people can potentially Facebook message a trained helpline volunteer in moments of crisis or use a digital signposting tool that helps them find the right service as opposed to needing to know the service for which they are looking.  They could, potentially, even Skype with a therapist.  I am sure the members of this committee who represent rural areas will intuitively understand the value and potential of remote services, particularly as rural isolation and distance from bricks-and-mortar services continue to hamper preventative and emergency mental healthcare.<br\/><br\/>The possibility of a genuine round-the-clock public service is one that would repay any required investment many times over.  In that spirit of investment in long-term worthwhile projects, I wish to emphasise the excellent on-the-ground work carried out by the 13 current Jigsaw services, representatives from which are here with us today.  Extending the reach of Jigsaw to more parts of the country or increasing its reach generally would be an extremely positive step for the future of Ireland&rsquo;s youth mental health.  The service meets an essential need for brief interventions and has a notable 98% satisfaction rating for those who have been able to access its services.  Jigsaw will talk in much more detail about its service, but it is important that we see the impact it is having in local communities around Ireland and to state that as an independent organisation.<br\/><br\/>As the committee continues its work, I hope the need for more of these services will be front and centre, especially in light of Jigsaw's unstated role in supporting the case management of young people with mental health difficulties in many areas of the country, something that is absolutely pivotal in ensuring a joined-up and responsive national service.  If we are to do that and do it well, I am absolutely convinced from my own time as a member of the youth mental health task force that the recommendations identified by that group will need to be addressed in full.  The task force&rsquo;s report highlighted, for example, the need for an independent advocacy service for children and young people and for new leadership structures in the area of youth mental health, including dedicated leads on national and community levels to enhance service co-ordination and accountability.  The report also pointed out the need for legislative change that would allow 16 and 17 year olds to consent to their own mental health treatment and called for funds to be ring-fenced in order to satisfy the ever-growing need for counselling support services in third-level institutions.  Each of these recommendations, if fully implemented, would remove barriers to proper treatment and strongly enhance youth mental health provision in key areas.  I ask that the committee strongly consider the value of each of these proposals.<br\/><br\/>Crucially, I would like to point to the recommendations of another initiative, namely, the youth mental health pathfinder.  Its proposals in this area would be transformative.  However, a year after its approval by the Civil Service Management Board, implementation of the actions in its report has been delayed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The pathfinder report contains many innovative solutions to the challenge of co-ordinating cross-governmental action and of the existing accountability gap in regard to Government policy on youth mental health, while also making it clearer and simpler for young people to access appropriate services and receive standardised reliable treatment.  I would again strongly encourage the committee to recommend swift action on these proposals within a clear and accountable timeframe.<br\/><br\/>I want to speak about the work of SpunOut in respect of health promotion.  We have published the <i>Survival Guide to Life<\/i>for young people aged between 16 and 19, which aims to provide information across many of the issues and challenges faced by young people within that cohort.  Over 10,000 copies of the book have been ordered by young people and sent to them for free. It has been availed of by many different statutory services, including HSE services, Garda diversion projects and other youth work projects throughout the country.  We also produced &quot;Ditch the Monkey&quot;, a five-part animation series about the five ways to well-being.  Multimedia is becoming more important in getting across health promotion messages for young people.  It is the way in which they consume information online.  If a service does not have a video with subtitles that they can watch without sound on the bus, Facebook or their phone it is much harder to engage with young people.<br\/><br\/>On social media, the move from Facebook to Instagram is presenting us with challenges internally in the context of ensuring that we are where young people are today.  In terms of the traffic on our website, some of the top issues young people have mentioned and come to us for include anxiety and positive mental health.  Getting a good night's sleep, which is so important for physical and mental health, is a significant issue.  We recently launched a campaign on problem gambling, which, we note, is a significant issue for young men and women.  Being LGBTI+ in Ireland is still difficult and is presenting many problems and challenges for young people's mental health.  Employment is the number one area visited on the website.  We know that for young people being in employment or education is the number one protective factor in the context of their mental health.<br\/><br\/>While there is much more that could be said about the future needs of mental healthcare from a youth work perspective, I know that time is limited.  Therefore, I will restate the need for genuine, sustained funding increases for mental health services which build on and support the best practice and innovation in care we see from certain service providers.  I thank the Chair and members and would welcome any questions, either during this session or at a later time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525264200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Power.

The work it has carried out to date and the recommended actions it has put forward in its interim reports are to be commended.  The task at hand is not an easy one.  The landscape for mental health provision and support in Ireland is complex and mapping out a new vision for the future of mental health is challenging.  Integrated, joined-up thinking in the area of mental health is both challenging and lacking.<\/p> <p>  Areas such as research and stigma reduction continue to be the subject of under-investment.  Innovations in areas such as e-mental health, school supports and services operating outside 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. are limited in scale and ambition.  The whole population approach to mental health promotion and support, as put forward in A Vision for Change and strongly advocated for by Jigsaw, is needed, now more than ever, against a backdrop of mental health support services across primary and secondary care being under-resourced and over-stretched.<\/p> <p>  Jigsaw, as Ireland&rsquo;s national centre for youth mental health, will focus our contribution on youth mental health specifically.  At Jigsaw, we value young people.  They represent Ireland's future, not least because the economic future of the country depends on their health, productivity and vitality, but also because our society as a whole will be better and healthier with a stronger, more resilient youth population to the fore.<\/p><p>The public and political discourse is shifting.  As a result of the collective effort of the Government, elected representatives, the HSE, NGOs, civil society, the media, educational bodies and more, Ireland is beginning to see a significant change in how we view, talk about, respond to and support our young people&rsquo;s mental health.  We in Jigsaw are proud of our involvement at the forefront of this progress, and we strongly believe that Ireland has the potential to be a global leader in youth mental health research and support services by 2028.  <br\/><br\/>While many challenges exist in supporting our young people, we have come a long way in the past decade.  Only ten years ago, psychiatric-based supports for young people were the norm; young people were treated in a very similar way to adults in terms of mental health support, and Ireland had completely inappropriate, inaccessible and non-youth friendly services in place.  Fast-forward to today.  If A Vision for Change<i><\/i>was the blueprint for a new kind of response, Jigsaw is a manifestation of many of the key principles in this seminal document. <br\/><br\/>Jigsaw&rsquo;s vision is an Ireland where every young person&rsquo;s mental health is valued and supported.It was established in 2006, as Headstrong, to meet an identified gap in service provision for young people struggling with their mental health, possibly with emerging mental health difficulties which did not require the support of specialist mental health services.  Jigsaw is funded by the HSE mental health division, MHD, and provides services in a primary care setting.  Jigsaw is an evidence-informed - through our Jigsaw data system, JDS - community-based mental health service for young people aged 12 to 25 years experiencing mild to moderate mental health difficulties.  We provide young people in distress with a safe, confidential and professional service where they can access free talking therapies.  We support young people to develop the coping skills and resilience that help them deal with present and future challenges to their mental health.  These services are free, accessible, timely, impactful and evidence-driven mental health supports offered through our network of 13 regional hubs.  It is interesting to note that 25% of referrals come directly from young people themselves, almost 40% from parents, just under 10% from GPs, and the remainder from other mental health services or educational settings.<br\/><br\/>The key features of the Jigsaw model include a focus on prevention as well as early intervention, accessibility and responsivity, and a commitment to meaningful youth participation and community involvement.  In addition to the direct talking supports offered to young people and their families, Jigsaw is actively engaged in a programme of evidence-informed mental health literacy and capacity building in the community.  This helps to ensure that parents, other concerned adults and those who work or volunteer with young people are better informed and more confident in promoting and supporting the mental health and well-being of the young people in their lives and become equipped to support young people in their community.  <br\/><br\/>Jigsaw is engaged in ongoing evaluation and monitoring of the services we deliver and the impact of those services.  This work is delivering with real impact.  We know from our evidence that Jigsaw is making a difference in the lives of young people.  Those young people who use our services are leaving less distressed, more resilient and better able to cope with the difficulties that arise in their young lives.  Over the past 12 years, Jigsaw has supported, directly and indirectly, the needs of almost 24,000 young people.  Most of those have been supported in the past three years.  In 2017 alone, we supported 4,387 young people and offered over 13,000 face-to-face therapeutic sessions across the country, tackling issues such as anxiety, low mood, anger, low self-esteem and isolation.  In evaluating our work, we found that last year 73% of 17 to 25 year olds who came to our services for a brief therapeutic interventions experienced a significant reduction in their psychological distress.<br\/><br\/>We value young people and their parents' feedback about their experience of the service.  Approximately 92% of those who responded to an anonymous survey reported being satisfied or very satisfied with their service from Jigsaw.  Alongside our face to face therapeutic work, we know that our mental health workshops and training, delivered to over 70,000 people across the country to date, increases awareness and knowledge about mental health issues, encourages higher levels of help seeking, reduces stigma and strengthens our communities&rsquo; confidence and competence in supporting the mental health of young people.<br\/><br\/>I would like to focus on solutions now.  It is clear that the time is right to address some of the fundamental challenges that present themselves and look at sustainable solutions to support youth mental health.  As my two colleagues have already mentioned, primary care is a hugely important issue.  It has been our experience in the past 12 years that there is significant demand for a primary care youth mental health service that is free, easily accessible, responsive and acceptable to young people.  There are large numbers of young people whose mental health needs can be appropriately supported in primary care but who do not need access to specialist care if they receive support early when experiencing mental health issues.  The more comprehensive and advanced our primary care supports are, the less the likelihood of inappropriate referrals going to the secondary specialist care system, causing increased delays and the clogging up of an already stretched system.  Mental health supports at primary care level in Ireland have been underdeveloped and underfunded for too long, contributing to the current problem we see in Child and Adult Mental Health Services, CAMHS, which are all too often characterised by unacceptably long waiting lists.<br\/><br\/>Jigsaw strongly believes that primary care mental health supports should be holistic and systemic in their focus.  In addition to the provision of widely available talking therapies, there should be an emphasis on the promotion of mental health and the prevention of more significant difficulties.  In order to drive the change we see as essential in youth mental health we need to better inform, support, educate and empower our communities, enabling a better understanding of our collective responsibility in and ability to support young people&rsquo;s mental health.  While resources are limited, funding a range of services should not be viewed as taking resources from one area for another.  In order to provide a single long-term vision for mental health services, all services should be acknowledged and resourced for the role they play in preventing, supporting and managing mental health issues.<br\/><br\/>Jigsaw employs psychologists, who are wither clinical, counselling or educational, social workers, occupational therapists and mental health nurses in its trans-disciplinary clinical model of clinical care.  Recruitment of sufficient numbers of appropriately qualified mental health professionals is a significant challenge to all agencies within the sector.  Jigsaw, just like other mental health service providers, faces daily challenges in this area.  What is clear it that there are a limited number of mental health professionals graduating into and entering the system.  There is significant competition for posts between services who are all struggling to resource their teams, with particular challenges in some geographical areas.  In Jigsaw&rsquo;s view, some of the elements that would contribute to easing the challenge of recruitment include increasing the numbers of university courses or places in relevant disciplines; for allied health professional training courses to include a greater emphasis on mental health, thereby facilitating a smoother and quicker transition for graduates into mental health service positions; and the promotion of the mental health field as a positive, progressive, recovery-focused place to work where one can make a real difference in the lives of others.  We involve our youth advisers in the recruitment process as we believe having an interest and passion for youth mental health is an important factor in ensuring that there is the right fit between a prospective staff member and the work they will do in Jigsaw. <br\/><br\/>A Vision for Change clearly references the need for greater integration across the various strands of the mental health system.  An augmented primary care system will work best and meet people&rsquo;s needs to the extent that there are linkages and more joined up thinking and pathways between primary, secondary and tertiary care.  We acknowledge that we are stronger when we work together, linking in and working with like-minded organisations, individuals, agencies and funders.  It is only through this collective action that we can truly develop innovative responses and seek fresh, bold perspectives in the area of youth mental health.  <br\/><br\/>We see mental health as something that is part of our community, part of our workplaces, schools and part of our lives.  In Jigsaw, we are working with the HSE and with corporate partners &ndash; MSD, Three, Lidl, ESB and more - to bring about this change.  The CAMHS standard operating procedures, SOP, lists Jigsaw as a direct referral agent with the provision that Jigsaw referrals must be made by a senior clinician in collaboration with a GP.  However, some CAMHS services do not accept these collaborative referrals from Jigsaw, insisting instead that the young person go to their GP for a referral.  This causes delays and puts another step in the process that is already difficult for the young person and his or her family.  We would like to see a real commitment to interagency working that is based on meeting the needs of young people and their families which supports their movement across the mental health service system in as seamless a way as possible.  <br\/><br\/>We believe research in the area of mental health is wholly under-resourced.  Jigsaw&rsquo;s seminal My World survey of 2012 remains the largest and most impactful study of its kind in Ireland.  However, data contained within the study is nearing its tenth anniversary and we need to review at the full range of risk and protective factors at play for today&rsquo;s youth population.  In line with Jigsaw&rsquo;s strategic objective to deliver robust research and evidence to better inform systems change and effective service delivery and to increase our collective understanding of youth mental health, we believe in the value of investment in a new research agenda on the modern-day lived realities of our young people.  We believe that is needed now more than ever and we are planning to repeat the My World survey this year.<\/p><p>As has been mentioned by my colleagues, e-mental health is another important area.  At Jigsaw, we believe that digital technology can make a significant contribution to enhancing public understanding of mental health.  We see the potential for digital technology to transform the way young people look after their mental health and to transform the way we, as a country, design and deliver mental health supports and services.  We are currently working with two corporate partners, MSD and 3, to initiate the development of a high-quality, accessible e-mental health platform that has both a prevention and early intervention focus.  <\/p><p> Since Jigsaw was founded, young people have been involved in helping us to develop and design our services.  We now have youth advisory panels in each of our services and in the national office.  These panels are made up of young people aged between 16 and 25 who may or may not have experience of the mental health system but who are all passionate about this area.  More than 130 youth volunteers help to inform and guide our decision making at all levels of the organisation.  They have representation at the board of directors meetings and on board subcommittees and are involved in the recruitment of staff and in representing Jigsaw at national and international events.<\/p><p> Our youth advisers asked me to emphasise the following points to the committee today.  It is important to start at the start and not to wait until the end to support a young person.  Early intervention needs to be emphasised more.  There is a lot of focus currently on second level services - child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, etc. - but there needs to be a focus on supporting young people earlier, in schools and colleges, to let them know more about what will support their mental health.  Greater knowledge and supports for young people who have more significant mental health problems are also needed.  Services need to be more youth friendly and the transition from CAMHS to adult mental health services needs to be looked at.  If one needs a CAMHS service when one is 17, being put on a waiting list for adult services just because one turns 18 is not acceptable.  More resources are needed generally to ensure that requests for support are responded to appropriately.  The age of consent for accessing mental health services needs to be reduced to 16 years.  Young people may want to access support due to family issues but may not feel able to tell their parents what the real problem is and having to get parental consent when one is 16 or 17 is a barrier for some young people.  Young people also highlighted the importance of being greeted in a service by friendly staff and being made to feel respected.  This will have an impact on their engagement with mental health services.  Mental health overall is about human experience and we need to remember this aspect. <\/p><p> By continuing to invest in youth mental health specifically, we can ensure that we continue to enhance and evolve the services we provide, to increase our knowledge, to deliver more impact and to increase supports for adults, families and parents.  We need to work together and to create meaningful partnerships and we need to work tirelessly to ensure that no young person suffers alone without access to the help he or she deserves and may desperately need.  As the landscape of mental health evolves and changes, so too must our responses.  We very much welcome the opportunity to discuss further some of the issues that we have raised during this meeting.  I thank the committee for the invitation to participate in this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525264200,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Duffy.

I apologise for missing some of the oral presentations but I had the opportunity to read all of them beforehand.  I have a few general questions and a few key ones.  It is very clear, and we all acknowledge, that there is a crisis both in our mental health as a nation and in the mental health services available to those who are in crisis.  We all agree that there is a necessity to promote positive mental health among everybody.  As Chair of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, one of the first tasks which members of the committee, including myself and Deputy Catherine Martin, undertook was to make very clear recommendations on promoting positive mental health both in formal and informal education.  We are awaiting responses from the Minister in that regard.  I commend the work the organisations have done.  It is excellent.  I also want to put on the record that we have some excellent community organisations which deliver really good responses on the ground, particularly Hope(d) in my own constituency of Kildare South.  It is a totally voluntary organisation which does not get any State funding.  The work it does to help support young people in need in particular is incredible.<\/p> <p>  To move onto the specifics, the funding situation the witnesses have outlined is incredible.  To think that in 1960 Ireland allocated 23% of the total health budget to mental health and that we now allocate 6.4% is absolutely shocking.  As the witnesses have noted, we have recommended that allocation be raised to 12%, which is the standard recommended by the World Health Organization.  We completely agree with that.  Children comprise 23% of our citizens.  We all acknowledge the levels of stress they are under and, very sadly, the levels of youth suicide.  I believe we have the seventh highest rate in Europe.  What interventions do the witnesses believe are most successful in promoting resilience in young people?  That is what we are all about.  This is about helping our young people to develop resilience and to develop the coping skills they need.<\/p> <p>  We have discussed CAMHS before.  Speaking for many public representatives, very sadly we hear very negative anecdotal reports about CAMHS which is available when people can actually get into it.  We absolutely need to eliminate the delay caused by the requirement for a GP referral before a person is referred to Jigsaw.  That seems to be unduly time consuming.  How can we improve interagency co-operation?  I acknowledge that we did have explanations from the HSE in respect of the difficulties in recruiting appropriate personnel to deal with this area.  That is part of the problem.  <\/p> <p>  What interventions are most successful in combatting anxiety among all age groups?  As I said already, that has been increasing.  As a Deputy with many rural constituents I am always concerned by the lack of services available in rural areas because many of our younger people do not have access to public transport in order to be able to get to a place where they can get help.  Obviously that is also the case for older and vulnerable members of the population.  We have to ensure that those who need timely access to support get it.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask Dr. Duffy why the GP referral rate to Jigsaw is so low.  GP referrals make up only 10% of its referrals.  Obviously it makes referrals to GPs, but there does not seem to be referrals in the reverse direction.  Speaking locally, the nearest Jigsaw hub to Kildare is in Tullamore, which is obviously not feasible for Kildare residents to access.  We have the fastest growing percentage of young people in the country.  Is there any hope that we could have one in Kildare?  It would be really good.  Obviously it would be good for every county.<\/p> <p>  On another general question, how do we make our primary mental healthcare supports more holistic?  It is very important that everybody feels they have access to it.  We acknowledge that recruitment and retention rates remain a huge issue in this sector.  How can we encourage young people to enter this field and to feel that they have a contribution to make?  Again I would like Jigsaw to expand on how allied health training courses can facilitate a better transition.  Will Dr. Duffy advise further on the progress Jigsaw has made on e-mental health?  This would be of massive help to that rural-dwelling population and to young people who are, perhaps, more comfortable using technology than having face-to-face interventions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#F00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1525264200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The witnesses have less than two minutes to answer all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#F00400","speaker":"1354"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I will start taking some of the questions, if that is okay, and then my colleague, Dr. Gillian O'Brien, might answer some more.  I thank the Deputy for her comments.  On the expansion of Jigsaw, we are working closely with the HSE.  Some members of the committee may know that the initial model in Jigsaw was based on philanthropy, which was then matched by HSE funding.  Jigsaw services are now predominantly funded through HSE supports.  We are working with the HSE to develop a plan for the next number of years and it is currently carrying out an evaluation of the Jigsaw services.  We would love to be able to expand further and to develop.  We have done some work ourselves on how we would expand into the areas and how we would make those decisions, because we would love to see Jigsaw across all of the counties and across all the country but we need a plan in place for that.  We are working closely with the mental health division to develop that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I will speak to the issue of the GPs.  It may seem that our rate of referrals from GPs is quite low at approximately 10%.<\/p><p>Our preference would be to encourage young people to self-refer to Jigsaw.  What tends to happen is that the GP, after the consultation with the young person, simply tells the young person to make direct contact but that if he or she likes, he or she may be referred by the GP.  The GP will say that, to make direct contact, the young person can lift the phone or send an email.<\/p><p> With regard to the interventions that are most successful in reducing anxiety and promoting resilience-building, there is a good evidence base indicating talking therapies have a lot to contribute.  The nature of the therapeutic relationship is also very important.  There is a lot of evidence but ultimately we need to help young people to develop an understanding of their emotional awareness, learn to regulate emotions and understand how, when they feel very anxious or distressed, they can soothe themselves and manage that.  Not only do we need to support and educate young people, but we also need to support and educate parents and others around the young people, such as significant adults or \"one good adult\" in the community.  Referred to already was peer-to-peer information-sharing and support.  We have found this to be very valuable.  We train many young people in second level schools in evidence-based programs so they can impart information to their peers on how to recognise signs of anxiety and what can be done about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gillian O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>What we have seen in recent years is a new conversation about mental health, particularly among young people.  They have a much more mature attitude to mental health than previous generations.  The question is whether we have the infrastructure to respond to that.  There has been much focus, rightly, on the development of CAMHS.  CAMHS is really designed for 2% of the population.  It is a matter of what is to be done with the other 98% and determining what is happening in our communities, societies and family structures that has suddenly changed.  There has been a sevenfold increase in the number of young people presenting with anxiety-based conditions.  Sometimes within families, for a variety of reasons, including those related to housing and insecure employment, the opportunity for parents to spend time with their children and model life experiences is not what it might be.  We must be very cautious in this space that we do not pathologise life.  One of the experiences of childhood is that there are slings and arrows and various opportunities and scenarios that are adverse.  We cannot treat these away, nor should we attempt to do so.  The skills required are life skills but one needs to have access to \"one good adult\", perhaps a parent, coach or teacher but someone the young person can select and to whom he feels he can relate and who can give guidance or offer a listening ear.  This is really valuable.<\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of work and some extraordinarily useful tools developed in the e-mental health space.  E-mental health services can do things human therapists cannot do.  The services can be available 24-7.  They can understand where one is and the antecedents of one's behaviour and determine whether one is in a difficult position.  They can determine whether one is active or texting at 4 a.m. and whether these are issues.  We need to be careful to ensure that, while e-mental health services augment and supplement other initiatives, they do not supplant them.  We need to be careful that we do not swing in a pendular way just to an e-mental health model.<\/p> <p>  In the wider mental health space, there is a real prevalence challenge.  We know from research done by Dr. Corey Keys in Atlanta that about 16% of the population enjoy good mental health.  Approximately 54% have what is described as mental health adequate to cope with life's demands, and approximately 20% of the population will have a diagnosis and be in treatment.  A further 10% are described as languishing.  These are people for whom life can be difficult and awkward but who do not have a diagnosis.  What is fascinating about the research is that it shows that over the course of time people move from one category to another.  That one is enjoying good mental health today does not immunise one in any way.<\/p> <p>  In the past, we talked about one in four.  Essentially, we are talking about four in four.  Therefore, it is our collective mental health that we need to address.  That is why this committee's work is so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Rogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525264200,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank all the delegates for attending.  I will be as brief as I can.  Mental Health Ireland raised the issue of access.  I was speaking to Deputy Crowe about this and I said that if somebody needs a newspaper, he or she knows they have to go to the newsagent.  Newsagents are readily available.  If one wants a drink, one goes to the pub.  Gaining access to mental health services seems to be the biggest problem.  We have many organisations going in the same direction but they are splintered.  We and the delegates have all been very successful with regard to the mental health awareness campaigns.  They are working but we do not have a mental health access awareness programme.  If one's leg is broken, one knows one has to go to hospital and one knows the service one has to access.<\/p> <p>  In the past two years, anxiety has been a major issue across the board.  I will not elaborate on this.  Suffice it to say much anxiety has to do with isolation, social media and spending five or six hours in the bedroom.  It is definitely leading to anxiety.<\/p> <p>  How do all the delegates feel about age-appropriate mental well-being in schools?  I refer to children in primary school and even younger.  Two of the speakers mentioned coping skills.  We are not giving our young people the coping skills to deal with what comes along in life.<\/p> <p>  My next point is on the charities and voluntary groups that are supporting all the initiatives.  The delegates referred to 6%, 10%, the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the WHO, and the funding of 12% or 12.5%, which I totally agree with even though I worked on the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Do the delegates believe many of the mental health services are being run on the cheap because of the funding?  We know there is a lack of funding.<\/p> <p>  My final point is on recruitment, on which I am going to be very blunt.  Could the delegates answer simply, with a \"Yes\" or \"No\", the question of whether we need the unions, all the sectors and the Government to agree the staff are not being paid and that if they cannot be paid, they cannot be recruited.  If the staff cannot be recruited, there will be a forever-toxic system with a revolving door that will never be fixed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#G00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":240,"content":"<p>On the point on accessing mental health services and awareness of how to access them, we often place emphasis on the burden of understanding what service one is meant to go to on the person as opposed to helping that person navigate towards the service he needs.  One of the recommendations in the youth mental health task force guidelines was on a digital signposting tool that would use artificial intelligence to ask a person questions about what he or she is feeling in order to narrow down the number of appropriate services.  There has been good work done on that in Australia.  ReachOut Australia has a tool called NextSteps and it has sound clinical governance underpinning it.  The HSE is currently considering replicating something similar here.  We hope it could be done in a relatively quick timeframe to respond to the point the Deputy raised.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, with regard to texting, we know young people do not do anything by picking up the telephone anymore.  Since they do not order a pizza or taxi by telephone, why would they talk about the most vulnerable aspect of themselves, namely, their mental health, over the telephone?  Why would they feel comfortable in doing so?<\/p> <p>  One of the other recommendations in the task force report was on scaling the provision of active listening services, such as the Samaritans and Childline, but through texting and live chat, including services such as Facebook Messenger.  In the United States, services such as Crisis Text Line are extremely popular, fulfilling a great demand for young people who want to talk to somebody in moments of crisis.  Such services are obviously not to supplant other services, as my colleague from Mental Health Ireland mentioned, but they help to get people from a heated moment to a cool calm moment when they can move on to another service.  We really need to step up the sense of urgency in regard to services like those.<\/p> <p>  I take the point on resilience and education.  Education should start from the early years and extend right up through primary, secondary and tertiary education.  With regard to one of the points Deputy O'Loughlin made on resilience and what is most effective, there are a number of really effective evidence-based interventions in terms of resilience-building but we need to come together to agree on which we are going to back and which we want to see mainstreamed.  There is too much fragmentation in what is being provided.  That leads to inconsistency in the educational experience of children and young people around the country.  This is not dissimilar to the issue of sex education.<\/p><p>We need to have a situation whereby such education is standardised and ensure that every young person gets the same quality experience.<\/p><p> Finally, there is a supply and demand equation when it comes to recruitment.  Let us remember that when supply is lower than demand then the price increases.  Therefore, we should pay competitive rates to attract qualified people from around the world to work in the mental health service here.  Such an initiative is difficult because it has ramifications for elsewhere in the public sector.  We need to start working on what Dr. Duffy mentioned and increase the pool of qualified people here, domestically, over time through the Irish education system.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Deputy Buckley asked whether the solution was just getting everybody in a room together, thrashing things out and considering the amount of money available.  That is one factor but another factor to consider is the culture within the mental health service.  As I outlined in my opening remarks, one should consider the promotion of the service as positive, progressive and recovery focused.  When we think about mental health we need to think about the mental health of workers and that of staff working in the system.  As we know from first-hand experience when people come to work for Jigsaw, the fact that the staff work directly with young people and focus on something that is positive and is very much recovery-focused in terms of early intervention and prevention, really gives a sense of energy and a sense of making a difference.  If one works in a service that is very depleted and there is only a small number of people on a team then it is very hard.  One can see people make the personal choice to defect and move and, as a result, there is a huge loss of significant experience across the board.  Therefore, we need to think about the mental health service much more broadly, and consider ways to ensure Ireland, as a country, has a really positive view of mental health and views it as a spectrum and that early intervention is needed.  There are long-term significant supports needed at other ends of it but by working together we can achieve and create them.  We must also be mindful that people have different skills at different levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>A number of really important points have been made about access.  Research into access has been done in the north west.  In Donegal, young people were asked where they would go if they found themselves in difficulty and they gave five primary responses, which were: talk to one's parent or parents; talk to a teacher; talk to a friend; get drunk or self-harm.  These were all five live available options and, unfortunately, the last two are particularly harmful.  One of the great elephants in the room is our relationship with how people self-medicate with alcohol.  It is a huge issue for us and is one of the significant oversights in A Vision for Change.  In fact, the policy outlined in A Vision for Change sometimes looks more like the mental health policy for Saudi Arabia than it does for Ireland because alcohol is only mentioned twice in the document, which is a problem.<br\/><br\/>In terms of health promotion in schools, preschools, cr&egrave;ches, etc. and other forms of health promotion such as the one entitled the First 1000 Days, the Mental Health Reform organisation has produced an excellent document that makes a strong bid for perinatal mental health.  We know from research done in the US that there are lifelong benefits to be gained when one invests in early childhood interventions such as family supports, quality supports and coping strategies.  They are very useful as well.<br\/><br\/>As Mr. Power has mentioned, e-mental health can help to extend the prevalence challenge and improve the qualify of signposting but we still need to be mindful.  In Japan, there is a phenomenon called <i>hikikomori<\/i>, which refers to about 700,000 young Japanese men who live in their bedrooms and do not interact with humans at all.  Their families know these men are still alive because a pizza slice will be missing from the fridge and the men will have retreated back to their bedrooms.  Some of the men play computer games against other humans while others will only play against a computer.  The men are not recognised as having autism or other mental health issues.  They have simply opted out of their communities and we can expect to see some of that issue in the future.  We need activities that include sports, culture, and young people being involved in their community space.  People who are equipped and skilled to develop young persons in a rounded sense are really important to us.  These are things on which we can get a heads up in order to avoid such a phenomenon in the future.<br\/><br\/>As Dr. Duffy pointed out, staff can work in this arena.  It is more agile, responsive and can be more focused but there is a risk that we could strip staff from other front-line services.  As an English-speaking country we have some of the finest graduates in mental health professions.  I know from Australian and Canadian colleagues that they are thankful to Ireland, as a donor site, for offering up staff.  This is an internationally competitive market.  Over the past decade the HSE and other health providers were not in a position to outbid better performing economies at that time.  The cost of possibly having a home, particularly in the Dublin area, has become prohibitive and it is quite a challenge for mental health services to retain staff in Dublin areas.  We need to be creative and imaginative and not imaginary about recruitment.  In the UK there is the London weighting model that recognises the additional cost of living in the city.  Perhaps such an initiative should be revisited in this context otherwise we simply will not be able to provide services where we have the greatest concentration of the population.  That is not a prospect we can entertain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Rogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525264200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Rogan.

A year ago I visited the Jigsaw centre in Limerick.  I was given an extensive tour and met the guys so I can attest to the fact that a fantastic services is being provided in Limerick.  I spoke to the staff about rolling the initiative into rural areas in the form of pop-up clinics.  Limerick is different, because the county is smaller relative to the size of Limerick city.  Therefore, the city has a big influence on the county but the western and southern parts of the county do not have such affiliation.  It is about trying to provide a service all over.  Is there a timeline for rolling out the Jigsaw programme throughout the rest of the country?  Will the scheme be rolled out on a phased basis?  Is Jigsaw considering how to expand its existing 13 services into rural areas?  If so, how does Jigsaw propose to set up in new counties?<\/p><p>Jigsaw provides a fantastic service.  Jigsaw has produced a self-help or self-awareness book.  On 12 April I attended the launch of an initiative called Read Your Mind at the Kilmallock Library in County Limerick.  The initiative brings together an invaluable collection of 100 books that promote awareness about mental health and energises local school children and makes them aware of the literary resource.  The people concerned with the project want to make it normal for such information to be available.  I found the initiative quite helpful myself when I spent a couple of hours there.  Does Jigsaw have a roadmap for rolling out projects?  How has interaction been between the Department and Jigsaw?  What is the budget and timeline?  <\/p><p>Mr. Rogan, from Mental Health Ireland, mentioned the stigma and prejudice associated with mental health issues.  Can he suggest ways to combat same, from his experience? Such negative beliefs are intergenerational and have been passed down from one generation to another.  I agree with him that young people nowadays are more open about mental health issues than older generations, even including my generation.  Perhaps that is because mental health is talked about more.  This committee provides a forum to speak about the issue.  Mr. Rogan also said that men are reluctant to seek help.  Can he flesh out his views for the benefit of men who are watching these proceedings or may watch it in the future? <\/p><p>In terms of <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>, Mr. Power mentioned that three quarters of all serious mental health difficulties start to present when a person is aged between 15 and 25.  I am very much on par with his views on early intervention and working on same.<\/p><p>In terms of the debate on funding and deciding whether to direct funding to providing acute services or early intervention and which do we consider first, I believe we must concentrate on both aspects and alleviate the waiting list for acute services.  I hope this committee will provide a blueprint on how to proceed.  As time goes on one can take more funding from the acute services and move it to early intervention.  As he said, one will not have the same volume of cases presenting and that will have a knock-on effect on the culture.<\/p><p>ICT has been mentioned.  What are Mr. Power's thoughts on same?  I will play devil's advocate and say that we have a paradox.  We have heard a lot about how social media puts pressure on young people and that young people spend so much time on their mobile phones that they are losing the art of interaction, communication or interpersonal communication.  On the flip side, we are marketing an e-service to interact with services.  Is there a drawback in having an e-service?  I am not saying that it is wrong and simply wish to learn more.  Should we start putting resources into education to foster or encourage face-to-face interaction or more human interaction in everyday life?<\/p><p>Could the witnesses tease that one out?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#H00700","speaker":"1328","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Neville for his comments on Jigsaw Limerick.  He asked about development and expansion.  Jigsaw is in 13 individual services in nine counties.  There are five services in Dublin.  We have done some future planning, which would be part of our strategic plan, to look to develop Jigsaw to have national coverage.  We would expect that to be around 24 services.  The reason we say that is because we know that for some counties, based on population, geography and the actual transport infrastructure, it is better to look at them as joint units so if we are in Sligo-Leitrim, it might be one unit.  We are in Offaly at present and if we were to move to Laois, we could expand into Laois.  We are looking at it in two ways.  The first is to consider whether there are current Jigsaw services we can expand on an intercounty basis?  In this context, Offaly to Laois would be one that would not demand a significant investment.  The second part of it is looking to expand so that we are working to have nationwide coverage.  As I mentioned earlier, we are working with the HSE in evaluating the Jigsaw service.  This is being done independently.  The HSE expects to have a report at the end of June on that.  That is effectively looking at where Jigsaw fits within the wider mental health system.  We would see it as very much fitting within primary care.  What we hope to see coming from that would be an agreed plan we could develop on a phased basis and look at all the learning we have generated so far and how we work with communities where there is significant knowledge about youth mental health and there are significant other structures in place.  That can really help Jigsaw to grow and develop very well.<\/p> <p>  In tandem with that and with support from the corporate sector, we hope to develop the e-mental health side of it because we know that we will not be able to see every young person in a Jigsaw service even if we had national coverage.  We want to encourage and develop information giving and interaction and, ultimately, encourage online support, as has been mentioned before.  There is no firm plan in place for the future expansion but we are very hopeful around that.  We know that in terms of our development, so far, there has been very much a trial-and-error model in terms of developing it, looking for funding, developing the evidence and continuing to develop that.  Our relationship with the HSE is very positive but it will take a significant amount of time.

One of the things our organisation is looking to is creating real opportunities for people with self-experience.  In the past number of weeks, we have recruited eight new staff, six of whom are people with self-experience.  I was in Limerick yesterday meeting with four of our staff who are peer educators in collaboration with the HSE - the service improvement fund.  Again, these are people with self-experience who have recovered and want to give something back.  They have really powerful testimony and message to give and it is a message of hope.  Sometimes in the past, people who have had quite severe and disabling mental health issues have tried not to mention it because it can have limiting effects on their career, employment or other social opportunities.

Part of the role of our organisation is to make sure people have progressive pathways onwards and forward and that communities are more open to the space.  We need to highlight the that mental health services are increasingly successful in terms of people retrieving their lives and making progress in their lives.  That is probably the untold story in mental health and is certainly one on which we need to focus much more effectively.<\/p> <p>  With stigma, we are inclined to locate the problem within the individual.  If we use the language of discrimination, we are saying it is other people's attitudes that need to be adapted.  This is the reason for initiatives such as Healthy Cities.  The mayor of New York, for example, has dedicated 1% of his budget, which is $850 million, to a city-wide initiative to promote mental health.  Limerick is a very good example of a Healthy Cities approach, which actively incorporates mental health into its objectives.  Again, our organisation is very active in that process.  Limerick Mental Health Association now has a three-week event that includes 34 different partners around Mental Health Week in October.

However, it is in a very sanitised way.  We still have an issue with stigma around mental illnesses and some of the most severe mental illnesses and we need to do a lot more work to educate the public at large about illnesses like schizophrenia and other illnesses that people still do not understand and, therefore, still stigmatise.  Coming back to the point about where to invest, I agree both simultaneously, in terms of prevention and acute services.<\/p> <p>  It is really important to point out that e-mental health is not a panacea.  There are particular applications of e-mental health that are appropriate.  We need to learn from the UK's experience, particularly the NHS, which has created a whole NHS digital team relating to mental health.  The NHS has funded that research programme significantly to understand what types of e-mental health interventions work for particular issues.  The learning there has been that one cannot design a one-size-fits-all e-mental health response.  It needs to be individual with regard to the experience or the particular condition or issue experienced by people.  There have been a number of key targeted responses for generalised anxiety disorder.  Augmented reality has shown some real promise in responding to psychosis, so that is really important.  <\/p> <p>  We have been talking about how lots of people have a positive experience of the mental health service.  When people do not, we focus on the negative to the point where we potentially deter people from seeking help.  We really need to start looking at being solutions-focused when problems arise, not dwelling on what has happened and trying to identify how to fix the problem.  A number of service improvement projects are in train within the HSE, not least the one relating to CAMHS.  The review of the standard operating procedure is ongoing.  We need to build those services up because they contain staff members who are becoming demoralised by the public narrative relating to mental health services.

Last week, for example, we met representatives of Men's Shed which has a really active role in engaging with and mobilising men.  It was not designed as a health initiative, but it has many benefits.  Unfortunately, one of the primary carers when it comes to mental health is the Irish Prison Service, where many find themselves in difficulty by virtue of having very significant and mental health needs which are under-met in the community.  In Ireland approximately 7% of the prison population have a psychotic illness.  If someone has a psychotic illness, he or she should not be in prison but availing of a mental health service within the community.  Some 80% of those admitted to prison who present with it are already known to mental health services.  We need to listen more closely to men and devise models that are attractive to them that do not in any way undermine their masculinity, role or position.  Coming back to the point about stigma, it has been found to have a chilling effect on some people's careers or their roles in communities, but we are much more optimistic in that regard as we see more people coming forward with initiatives such as social farming and sports activities in which men engage on mental health topics in a more constructive way.  Models that work well for women may not translate easily for use by men.  Sometimes men can find talk therapies difficult.  The shoulder to shoulder conversation is easier for men than eye to eye contact, which is often considered to be confrontational.  Self-medication with drugs and alcohol is far too appealing and accessible for men.  We need to find much more progressive and healthier models.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Rogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>On Mr. Rogan's point, we need to design services with young men in mind.

I commend the delegates from Jigsaw.  Where I come from in Neilstown it is very good.  I have been there a few times and it is well used by young people throughout the area.  I have a couple of questions to ask.  <\/p> <p>  I want to ask Mr. Rogan about his observations on the 1960s.  If 23% of the health budget was spent on mental health services in the 1960s, that means many people would have been hospitalised in mental health services in the 1960s compared to 2018.  Today some 6% of the health budget is spent on mental health services; therefore, obviously, a substantial number of people have been dehospitalised in the past 50 years.  What is Mr. Rogan's take on it?  <\/p> <p>  I have an observation on the use of social media and smartphones.  We all use them and all think they are great to some extent, but they can have a serious dark side, too, particularly for young people.  They can be individualistic in targeting young people because social media platforms are clever in targeting their market and their market is young people.  That can play games with the heads of young people who can be so competitive against one another.  We cannot get away from it, but social media can be detrimental, no matter who people are but particularly to young people.  Will Mr. Rogan comment on this?  <\/p> <p>  Are we dealing with bullying, specifically among young people?  We are talking more about mental health services.  The subject was taboo as nobody wanted to talk about his or her own mental health, but we are talking more about it than ever before.  Since I became a Deputy, it has been one of the narratives of this Parliament.  Talking about it is really good, but when one sees the flip-side, one sees that when people want to access mental health services, they cannot find them.<\/p> <p>  Some of the delegates before the committee have been really stark.  They have shone a light on how mental health services have been really bad and let people down.  It is due to a lack of funding, a lack of retention and recruitment of staff.  I probably fell into the trap of playing this down a little a few times.  Staff in mental health services are fantastic.  They are both motivated and professional.  It is important that the narrative from the public and here be that the service is in a perennial state of crisis.  There is a crisis, from which there is no getting away.  Where services are not available, people will fall through the cracks and when some fall through, they will die, as was seen on the documentary broadcast on RT&Eacute; last week, \"The Big Picture\".  It is unbelievable how quickly things can fall apart for families and individuals.  There is major discontentment in a capitalist society which sometimes so competitive.  Alienation drives people away from each other.  Therefore, the more we talk about things and the more we, as humans, get together to collectivise our experiences and problems, the better it is for everybody's well-being.  The pressure these days, particularly on social media, is incessant.  Young people are on the phone all the time.  That cannot be good for their mental health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#K00600","speaker":"1299"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>The point on social media is important because they are here to stay and we need to get to grips with the issue.  I liken it to healthy eating.  We all know that we should eat healthily, but very few of us make all of our own meals and stick to a strict diet.  It is similar with mobile phones in the use of apps and various other things.  We all know that they are not necessarily good for our mental health, but we are still compelled to use them.  There is an addiction which is not dissimilar to eating junk food, consuming soft drinks and that type of thing.  There is marketing at play on platforms, similar to how there is marketing at play when it comes to junk food companies.  Ultimately, we need to learn how to control our impulses, as we do in the case of healthy eating.  Just as we need to make it easier to eat healthily by reducing cost and such like, we need to make switching off and unplugging easier.<\/p><p>One thing we would recommend to young people is, for example, given that many apps automatically have notifications switched on in order to pull the user back in when they might be idle, that they should switch off notifications so they only dip in and out whenever they want to, as opposed to the app trying to wrestle their attention and control them.  There are various things like that.  If a person knows they are going out for a walk on the beach, there is no real reason to bring a phone.  There is a benefit to unplugging and having an experience with other people, such as knowing to put phones in the centre of a table when with friends, so people are not all mindlessly checking instead of being present with each other.  There are lots of things we can do.  We can blame social media companies, and I think they should be held to account for lots of things they could do but, ultimately, we have an ability to control ourselves.  We need to support young people to find the ways to do that, which is very important.<\/p><p> On the point on bullying, a lot of young people experience bullying in schools and this is obviously creeping into their home lives as well.  Of all of the interventions we have seen, and we have been very active in this space, it is vital to have a whole-school approach whereby sixth year students - or sixth class students in primary school - are built up to be the people who set the tone and say that bullying is not acceptable in a school and that trickles all the way down through the years.  What we find is that, once we give young people responsibility and a standard to which they should be held, they rise to that challenge and they support and educate the younger children to make sure it is socially unacceptable within that school community.  We have seen this in particular in Drimnagh Castle school, which has had huge success in implementing that type of model.  This needs to be replicated everywhere.  Schools used to have an issue in admitting they might have a bullying problem because it used to be seen as an issue, whereas schools are now being much more honest and open about it, which is very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>In regard to the historical reference, in the past we had a very large institutional base in Ireland and I do not think any of us are nostalgic for that.  These hospitals were often over-inclusive and included people with learning disabilities, people with mental health needs, people who were socially different and people who were graduates of orphanages and Magdalen laundries.  We had a great fondness for institutional care.  The pendulum has now swung in the opposite direction and we have gone from having the world's highest bed to population ratio to one of Europe's lowest.  It is a kind of Celtic thing to do, in that we go from one extreme to the other.  Even at that, the challenge is finding sufficient staff to serve that small number of beds, which is now lower than recommended norms.  Ireland operates some 22 acute beds per 100,000 of population whereas the European norm is closer to 70, so we can see the pinch point when someone needs hospitalisation.  Admission should be, if not a last, then a late resort, but there is really no substitute for it when that is the person's need.<\/p> <p>  We are very conscious that we simply will not be able to treat our way out of this demand.  This is why we need prevention, promotion, early intervention, engagement with people and upskilling of people to survive in the world.  As Mr. Power clearly said, smartphones exist and that technology is not going to go away, but while there is a certain level of \"new toy\" about them at the moment and they are probably over-intrusive in our world, they will fall back into the landscape over time.  Nonetheless, we need to be very mindful that it is not a passive relationship and is a much more motivated relationship to which we need to be alert.<\/p> <p>  What is very important in this forum is that we do not continually restate the diagnosis.  Restating the diagnosis is not treatment.  Saying things are terrible, shocking and awful leaves a very unhealthy and unhelpful impression in the public mind.  There are services and those services are far better than they have ever been in terms of the calibre and quality of both the services and the staff who are available.  While there are capacity issues, they can be addressed.  In the Victorian era there was an extraordinary investment in mental health and that continued up to the 1960s.  I am not sure our generation will be judged well by history in this regard.  We have the technology and the understanding, but the question is whether we have the willingness to invest in our mental health. That is a very simple question.  One of the important roles for this committee is to sample public opinion and ask the public what they want and expect and whether they are willing to pay for that.  If the answer is \"No\", then let us stop pretending, but if the answer is \"Yes\", then let us get on and do the work.  This forum is really important and, as public representatives, committee members are immediately in touch with the pulse of the public and their attitudes and needs.  If we want these services, we need to invest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Rogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525264200,"counter":272,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.  I apologise for being late but I was at a meeting of the victims committee, which meets at the same time.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by some of the conversation we have had and I suppose it reflects what is happening in the D&aacute;il Chamber today in regard to cervical cancer and the scandal around that.  With regard to the public perception of services and the chance of successfully treating people, what impact does this have on the roll-out of the services and what can be done to counteract this while addressing service problems?  Mr. Rogan referred to the message of hope and the untold story and so on.  We know there is a role for those people who have been through the services but that stigma is still there and it is uncomfortable for people to come out and talk about whatever difficulty they have had in their life.  Whether it is a health issue or a difficulty with alcohol or drugs or otherwise, it is unusual for someone to come out and say it.<\/p> <p>  It is a question of how we structure our response and this goes back to the issue of the services themselves.  We have had people come before the committee from various mental health services and they have spoken about their own experiences and I presume that has also been reflected here today.  They spoke about the pressure on them in their jobs.  For example, the people who came in and spoke about CAMHS referred to the lack of psychiatrists, the lack of supports and the lack of a team, and given they did not have that, they could not do their jobs.  The Chairman asked about the financial side and bringing people together.  However, one needs to have a work environment where people feel needed, and this applies in hospitals and throughout the health service.  The huge positive for anyone working in these services is that the work they are involved in is life-changing and life-saving.  That, in itself, is a huge draw for anyone who works in these services.  It is bit like the position with politicians, I suppose, in that we are all in it to try to improve things, and that, in itself, is a draw to the job and many people are motivated by those ideals.  It is the same with the services represented here today.<\/p> <p>  This should not be so difficult.  The frustration that comes from staff is that it is management-led, we do not know who the managers are and money is being spent but we do not know where.  We have recently introduced our own report and these were some of the frustrations that came out in that report.  The witnesses might give their own impressions of what can be done and what can be improved in regard to staffing levels.  I believe salary is only a small part of it because there are bigger issues.<\/p> <p>  On a final point on what is probably the biggest issue, we have the seventh worst suicide rate.  In the opinion of the witnesses, what is triggering that?  Again, it is a crisis we are all being affected by and it is happening in every community.  Is it our unhealthy attitude to alcohol, drugs, gambling or some other issue, given there is a whole list of issues I could point to?  What are the witnesses' views?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#L00300","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will concentrate on the first question, which was around the public perception of treating people.  There is a very common discourse of talking about waiting lists, waiting times and the desire to get into the health service.  There is very little discussion about what happens when a person is in there.  One of the things we need to talk about is how effective services are, what are the outputs and how the services make a difference.   When we work with young people, we are very much looking for feedback from them and their parents about the service.<\/p><p>The model that we operate on in terms of early intervention and prevention is that the young people come in and get some skills that help them over a crisis that they are in at the moment, but it also helps them to have skills to be able to make a difference in their lives in the future.  They are very much encouraged, insofar as they can, to talk about that experience with others.  We have had young people who were in a Jigsaw service check-in on Facebook and they let their friends and everybody else know through social media.  It becomes a socially acceptable place to be.  That is making a major difference in term of public understanding and in particular a generation to understand that one can talk about mental health in a different way.  I hope that in ten or 20 years time, when that generation has children, there will be a big difference in this area.<\/p><p> We know from working with young people that it is necessary to be incredibly focused.  We need to set goals with them that they set themselves.  We need to know what their outcomes are and they need to see a tangible difference after four, five, six or seven sessions.  That really makes a difference.  Mr. Rogan mentioned earlier the recovery-focused care and it is about changing the conversation to know that when someone is within a service they know they can receive a treatment or support that will help them for a particular time and then move on from that.  We want to move the conversation so that people can say if you go to Jigsaw or some other service, it will really help you.  The biggest difference is that when peers do it, when young people tell other young people or adults tell other adults, that is how we learn the most.  It is about changing that conversation to be able to say that if one can do it, it will help.  The difficulty at present is that we are concentrating on waiting lists and it is also about the public being able to demand to know and ask about the effectiveness of the service.  Is it value for money?  Is it really making a difference?  These are important questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Crowe's first question, one of the things we do on SpunOut is to publish lived experiences from young people.  We recognise that young people who are part of our service do not have a perspective on many of life's issues.  When young people experience or get into difficulty many of them wonder if they are the only person who is feeling this way or the only person who is experiencing something.  That is really important and it goes back to the point made by Dr. Duffy on the importance of a peer to peer approach.  It needs to detail the good, the bad and the ugly, in particular in relation to what many young people find useful.  Sometimes when they experience talking therapies for the first time, they might not click with the clinician, and when they do not, they often think that means that talking therapies are not for them, when in actual fact that young person just did not click with that one particular clinician.  What is also important in terms of the experience is the culture within services.  I welcome wholeheartedly the values in action programme.  It is a viral cultural change movement that is taking place in the HSE to build both confidence and satisfaction and pride in the service being provided by staff because they continually see not just in the mental health services, but widely throughout services, that the narrative around the HSE can be quite negative.  It is really important to make sure that the people who are working in the services know they are valued and that there is a culture of pride.  That speaks to the issue the Deputy raised that it is not just about money but enjoying where one works.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that this will be my last input so I would like to add that I think the work this committee is doing is really important.  This report and the reports already published have the opportunity to be transformative in setting an agenda and roadmap that does not currently exist for mental health care, similar to that of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Mental health care should not be lost within the overall report.  I am looking forward to leadership on that vision, because that is really necessary in the area of mental health care.<\/p> <p>  On the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder initiative, there is a proposal in the National Youth Mental Health Task Force Report 2017 calling for a team to be established under section 12 of the Public Service Management Act 1997, which is similar to the structure of the Criminal Assets Bureau, that is able to work across Departments.  One of the major challenges we face as a country is the challenge in getting Departments to work together and take collective responsibility for issues such as youth mental health, which crosses the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs and Health and be able to deliver co-ordinated actions that will be transformative for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1525264200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I ask witnesses to be brief because we have roughly four minutes remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#M00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Public perception is really important.  Sometimes in decision making perception can become reality very quickly.  I was talking to some Canadian colleagues last year and they were describing how in the past they used to talk about new growth of the outer chest wall, when talking about cancer.  I am very conscious there is a very difficult discussion on that in the Oireachtas today.  In Canada they were not allowed in polite company to use the language of cancer or breast and when people did not talk about these issues there was a problem.  I think we have moved on very radically from that.  The National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, has done some interesting research on this with the public, asking them individually, if there was some funding to spend, whether it should be invested in older person services, cancer control services or mental health services.  They discovered that even people who use mental health services were reluctant to step forward and say we need to invest in mental health services.  Unless there is a credible and recognised prospect of recovery, one would not throw good money after bad.  What is really important, as mentioned by Mr. Ian Power and Dr. Joseph Duffy, is there is a viral movement happening within the mental health community services.  In the Bonnington Hotel, 200 people will hear from those who have experienced mental health services who will come forward to describe how they have rebuilt their lives and will share that experience.  That is a really important message but it is happening below the radar.  There is a very different vibe.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Duffy has also mentioned staff mental health.  For those working in the mental health space, and I have worked in this space for over three decades, one is meeting people who are very broken and have had a lot of disadvantage in their lives.  Depending on how we understand mental health issues, one may ask whether this is distress and trauma, disease, disadvantage, disability and sometimes it can be all of the above.  For staff members it is really important that morale is kept high.  The essence of good mental health care is what we call that synaptic space, where the person in distress and difficulty meets with a skilled professional.  The morale of staff is really quite difficult to maintain.  I heard it said that the floggings will continue until morale improves.  Beating up on the staff who are doing extraordinary work in very limited circumstances is not helpful.  It might be entertaining, it might be theatrical, but it does not progress things at all.  It is really important that we acknowledge the work that is being done and recognise the work that needs to be set out to do next.  There is a different dialogue happening in the mental health space, in terms of service users and our younger population, which is very new and I think it needs to be followed though with actions and resources.  I am certainly encouraged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FMJ2018050200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Rogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525264200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>We were asked a really important question, namely what we think is leading so many young people in Ireland to take their own lives.

If we think of the modern Ireland we live in, it is very difficult for young people to feel okay about themselves, to know where they fit in, when they are under such pressure to achieve and to succeed.

The consultant contract 2008 reflects this requirement, the details of which were contained in HSE HR circular 021\/2017 concerning qualifications required for consultant posts.  The effect of this is that applicants who are not registered in the relevant specialist division cannot be appointed to a permanent consultant post in a HSE hospital or service or in a section 38 agency funded by the HSE.  The rationale for the change was the imperative to ensure that consultants employed in the public health system have the appropriate training, skills, competences and qualifications to deliver care as assessed by the Medical Council, which has the statutory role of protecting the public by promoting the highest professional standards amongst doctors practising in the State.<\/p> <p>  It remains the case that there are a number of consultants employed who are not registered in the relevant specialist division.  As of 14 April, this number stood at 127 out of a consultant workforce of 2,977 whole-time equivalents, or 4.3% of the workforce.  This number can be broken down into two main cohorts.<\/p> <p>  The first cohort consists of consultants employed prior to 2008.  There are 52 consultants in permanent employment who took up their posts before the introduction in 2008 of the contractual requirement to be registered in the relevant specialist division.  This represents 1.7% of the consultant workforce.  Of this number, 49 are employed in acute hospitals, one in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, and two in mental health services.<\/p> <p>  The second cohort comprises consultants employed post 2008.  There are 75 consultants currently in employment who took up posts since the introduction in 2008 of the contractual requirement to be registered in the relevant specialist division.  They represent 2.5% of the consultant workforce and are on short-term specific purpose contract, SPC, basis, a short-term locum basis or are engaged through an agency.  SPCs are used to fill permanent vacancies pending the filling of a new or replacement consultant post on a permanent basis after the necessary approval from the HSE&rsquo;s consultants appointments advisory committee, the selection process at the Public Appointments Service for HSE posts or within the section 38 agency, and the post-recruitment formalities of reference-checking, Garda vetting, and pre-employment occupational health status assessment.  Short-term locums are either employed directly by the HSE or section 38 agency, or are engaged through an agency in instances where cover is required for the annual leave of permanent consultants or for other temporary absences.  It can often be the case that appropriately qualified consultants registered in the relevant specialist division do not present as applicants for short-term locum posts or for SPC posts pending the filling of a new or replacement permanent post.  Service requirements have therefore led to the engagement of the consultants in this category.  HR circular 21\/2017 details requirements for consultant appointments.  I have set out in the opening statement the breakdown by hospital group and community healthcare organisation, CHO, of where the consultants are appointed.  I will not go through it, but the committee members have that information to hand.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline measures to address the issue, starting with risk mitigation measures.  The national clinical adviser and clinical programme group lead for mental health has sought and received assurances from the executive clinical directors in mental health services of risk mitigation measures, to include oversight of the practice of post-2008 consultants not in the specialist division.  Similarly, within acute services, hospital managers and clinical directors have put in place monitoring arrangements appropriate to the circumstances of the practice of post-2008 consultants not in the relevant specialist division.<\/p> <p>  A further measure consists of incentivising eligible pre-2008 consultants to apply for specialist registration.  The acute services division and the mental health services division are working to establish which of the pre-2008 consultants would be eligible for registration in the relevant specialist division on the basis of their having completed higher specialist training or equivalent.  As a once-off measure, the HSE will fund the Medical Council directly for the cost of the application process, such that the consultant will not incur any personal expenditure.<\/p> <p>  I refer also to upskilling post-2008 consultants who have not completed higher specialist training.  Colleagues in mental health are engaging with the Royal College of Psychiatrists to explore additional competence-based training for consultants to allow them to apply for specialist registration.  This approach will be a more complex issue in the acute services, given the greater number of consultants involved, the greater number of specialties, the procedure-based nature of training in some of those specialties and the greater number of training bodies etc.<\/p> <p>  The HSE is also minimising the timeline for filling new or replacement permanent consultant posts.<\/p><p>Clinical directors in mental health services and acute services are seeking to clarify the position with each post-2008 consultant post currently filled, by definition on a non-permanent basis, in order to establish where the post is on the continuum from approval at the consultants advisory committee for a new or replacement post, to advertisement, to shortlisting and interviewing at the Public Appointments Service, to post-selection formalities undertaken by Health Business Services recruitment prior to the offer of a contract.  The aim is to identify any impediments at any stage of this process with a view to elimination of these or otherwise to minimise the impact on the timeline for filling new or replacement permanent consultant posts.  The hospital groups&rsquo; HR leads will work with the HSE national doctors training and planning&rsquo;s doctors integrated management e-system, DIME, to access real-time data contained within DIME to allow full compliance with consultant specialist registration requirements and to ensure in the interim 100% compliance with the matching of approved posts on DIME to all occupied posts in the hospitals.<\/p><p> The recent appointment of an interim chief clinical officer will assist the delivery system to address the issue.  Addressing the issue is a key priority for the HSE.  Work is ongoing between the HSE, Medical Council and training bodies to address issues which I anticipate will be concluded at the earliest opportunity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosarii Mannion","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":290,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Medical Council, I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.<\/p> <p>  I will say a few words about the role of the Medical Council, which is very relevant in the context of this discussion and recent media commentary.  The Medical Council is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of doctors in Ireland.  Its purpose is to protect the public by promoting and ensuring the highest standards among doctors.  From the day a student first enters medical school until the day he or she retires from practice, the Medical Council works to ensure medical education and training remain up to date and are benchmarked to the highest international standards.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council sets standards for all undergraduate education and postgraduate training of doctors and also requires that all doctors fulfil ongoing professional competence requirements to ensure they keep their knowledge and skills up to date throughout their professional lives.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council provides guidance to doctors on matters relating to conduct and ethics through its Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners.<\/p> <p>  The Medical Council is also where the public may make a complaint against a doctor.<\/p> <p>  Regarding relevant information about doctors' practice, each year the Medical Council, during the annual retention period when doctors renew their registration, seeks out additional self-declared information which we then use for the production of the medical workforce intelligence report, which provides a detailed overview of doctors&rsquo; practice in Ireland, including the exit rates of doctors, the density of doctors in Ireland by county and the globalisation of the workforce.<\/p> <p>  Since 2012 the Medical Council has been seeking this additional information from registered medical practitioners to learn more about the scope of their practice.  These reports have been developed not only to support the council&rsquo;s work but also to inform wider health system planning and the evolution of systems of care.  The detailed insights enabled through the workforce intelligence presented in these reports continue to highlight a number of key challenges, including retention of doctors, variances in skills mix and models of care and practice arrangements.<\/p> <p>  Regarding doctors on the general division in hospital consultant roles, through sharing information about these challenges, the Medical Council looks to assist all bodies that shape the professional lives of doctors to ensure that the design, development and oversight of the medical workforce continues to foster good professional practice and to protect patients.<\/p> <p>  This information is based on self-declarations and although the figure for doctors on the general division who describe themselves as hospital consultants seems quite high, once the figure is further examined and broken into its component parts, it reduces.  As this question is based on self-declared information, it also includes doctors who are working outside Ireland, doctors in locum or temporary positions, doctors in acting-up positions, some doctors in training or further education, those currently not in a role etc.  A number of doctors, who qualified as specialists before the new legislation, did not &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; or transfer over to the specialist register in time, as they were entitled to.<\/p> <p>  The latest medical workforce intelligence report is still in draft and due to be published in the coming months.  However, we have taken the information most relevant to today&rsquo;s meeting and have made it available to the members of the committee and to the other organisations presenting here, with a full breakdown of the figures.<\/p> <p>  The supplementary information provided to the committee shows that 698 doctors on the general division have self-declared as hospital consultants in 2017.  Delving further into the figures and removing a number of exclusions such as those working abroad, the number of general division doctors indicating that they practise in Ireland as hospital consultants is 254.  Of the 254 doctors registered in the general division, 172 practice solely in Ireland with 149 of these working solely in publicly funded services.  A total of 165 declared they work in both public and private settings, and 81 indicated that they have a mix of working inside and outside of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  It is worth noting the term consultant is not defined under the Medical Practitioners Act, to which the council operates.  Accordingly the employer is free to hire anyone they want as a consultant, with the only limitation being that the doctor is on the Medical Council register.  However, a consultant cannot falsely represent themselves as a specialist if they are not on the specialist register.  The council only enters those practitioners on the specialist division who have the requisite higher qualifications in that discipline.<\/p> <p>  Doctors must be in compliance with maintenance of professional competence requirements and enrolled in a professional competence scheme relevant to their area of practice.  A registered medical practitioner must maintain their professional competence on an ongoing basis pursuant to a professional competence scheme applicable to that practitioner.<\/p> <p>  The register of medical practitioners is a living database.  Each working day at the Medical Council offices, doctors are entered in the register, are removed from the register and transferred between different parts of the register.  The figures we have provided today are based on data from the 2017 retention period which is a snapshot from one moment in time.<\/p> <p>  I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, President of the High Court, for further highlighting this issue recently and allowing the council to address the court on this topic on Monday.<\/p> <p>  It is also worth highlighting that we are seeing a shift in the make-up of the medical registers which we maintain.  The number of doctors on the specialist division is increasing and in 2017 the specialist division was larger than the general division for the first time which is a welcome development.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and the committee members for the invitation to address them today.  Both Mr. Prasifka and I are happy to address any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Breslin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for the opportunity to address them on the importance of specialist registration for hospital consultant appointments.<\/p> <p>  The 2008 contract defines a consultant as a registered medical practitioner who by reason of his or her training, skill and expertise in a designated specialty, is consulted by other registered medical practitioners.<\/p> <p>  It is worthwhile to review what is involved in training a consultant and why the integrity of this process is of such importance.  The majority of medical students enter medical school after their leaving certificate examination and then complete a five-year course in medical college.  This is followed by a year-long internship before progressing to sub-specialty training.  In most sub-specialties doctors will complete two or three years of basic training to provide a foundation of specialist knowledge and to develop both as individuals and doctors.<\/p> <p>  Then they complete five or six years of higher specialist training which is punctuated by specialist examinations, usually finishing with an exit examination and a professional qualification conferred by a recognised postgraduate college.  Only at this point will a doctor become eligible for specialist registration, which is regarded as a basic qualification for doctors who wish to apply for a position as a consultant.  I say basic because the vast majority of doctors who become eligible for inclusion in the specialist register will subsequently travel abroad, usually in order to gain clinical or research experience in a prestigious recognised international institution.  This has been the pattern for many years, and is likely to continue, because consultants in Ireland wish to provide patient care to a recognised contemporary standard and wish to gain the experience in an early stage in their career that will act as a foundation for their subsequent profession.<\/p> <p>  This model of training has several advantages for the healthcare system and for patients.  In the past there was a consistent supply of well-trained and experienced consultants in the Irish health system.  This was good for patients as they received the benefit of the consultants&rsquo; prolonged and sometimes arduous training.  It was good for the health system as there was a continuous supply of talented consultants entering the health system, and these newer consultants brought with them fresh thinking, vision and new approaches to what, on occasion, seemed intractable problems.<\/p><p>The health system also benefited as a whole because many of these motivated individuals became leaders within their professions and sub-specialties.  As a collateral benefit, the quality of patient care in the health system consistently improved.<\/p><p> The sustaining of these improved standards of care on a consistent basis now requires continuous recruitment of consultants who are trained to the highest international standards.  If we deviate from this paradigm of training and recruitment, we are at risk of compromising the standard of patient care in our healthcare service and there will be inevitable and unacceptable consequences for patients.  Therefore, at all stages of training we must foster a culture of academic achievement and clinical excellence in order that we can provide the best possible care for our patients.  In our efforts to achieve clinical excellence we must insist that doctors who act as consultants in our healthcare system are appropriately trained in that they are deemed eligible for specialist registration.  After all, this is the most basic of professional standards for doctors who wish to practise as consultants in Ireland.  We cannot deviate from international best practice whereby doctors are required to comply with recognised specialty-specific training criteria in order that the quality and consistency of patient care is protected.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, it has become apparent that these most basic standards are not being observed when filling an increasing number of consultant posts and there is a concern that this development is not in the best interests of patient care.  There are similar concerns about the appointment of non-consultant hospital doctors who have trained in countries outside the EU and the EEA who are no longer required to pass Irish Medical Council examinations, a requirement which applied until recently.  It was standard practice that doctors from some countries, following their intern year, completed the Medical Council's pre-registration examination system, PRES, clinical exam before they were deemed eligible to take up posts in the acute hospital services in Ireland.  We are of the view that the public deserves to receive a consistent standard of care across all public hospital and mental health services based on a uniform standard of training.  The failure to verify, by way of examinations, the basic and sub-specialty training and competencies is at odds with contemporary international practice in other European jurisdictions and English-speaking countries.  There is a serious concern that, in the absence of Medical Council exams for non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, inconsistent standards of medical training and competence will undermine the care patients receive.  Overall, the concerns relating to the appointment to specialist consultant posts of doctors who are not eligible to be on the Irish Medical Council specialist register have the potential to compromise seriously the standards of care we provide to our patients in our healthcare system.  That is our major concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ryan.

The figures in circulation from the Medical Council are self-declaration figures from 2015 of those who describe themselves as hospital consultants.  The figures would also include some people who are abroad, are in training, have not been grandfathered to the specialist register, are in locum positions, are in acting-up roles and are temporary consultants.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is a challenging place to work as a consultant.  Significant capacity issues impact on a consultant's ability to provide safe quality care to patients.  According to the health service capacity review, we require an additional 1,260 acute beds immediately and will likely require up to 7,000 hospital beds by 2031 in view of the current extent and pace of investment and reform.  Bed occupancy rates in Irish hospitals have risen to an average of 97% and sit even higher, at an average of 104%, in model 4 hospitals, well above internationally recognised safe occupancy rates of 85%.  The HSE full capacity protocol is now the norm, having been implemented on hundreds of occasions in 2017 in our major hospitals in Waterford, south Tipperary, Galway , Limerick, Cork and Beaumont.  Constant overcrowding, cancellation of lists and rolling theatre closures impact not only on patient care, but also on the ability of trainee specialists to maintain and develop their skills.<br\/><br\/>Hospital doctors in our health system work excessive hours and show high levels of stress and burnout.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland's A National Study of Wellbeing of Hospital Doctors in Ireland showed that, on average, hospital doctors work 57 hours per week, and one in three shows symptoms of burnout.  Antagonism of consultants by employers, politicians and the media adds to the poor morale of doctors.  Reluctance on behalf of the Government to engage with doctors in a meaningful way and political interference in contractual disputes reflect the inadequate value our politicians place in the medical profession.<br\/><br\/>I would also like to take this opportunity to say a few words on specialist registration and the industrial relations environment.  Doctors who have achieved specialist registration may practise independently without supervision and may present themselves as specialists.  Attaining such registration is, and should be, the goal for trainee doctors in the health system.  It should be a <i>sine qua non<\/i>for appointment to a consultant post that one should be so registered.  We have no doubt but that among this group of consultants who do not currently have specialist registration are many fine and committed doctors who do their utmost to deliver patient care in the most trying of circumstances, in a system starved of capacity and resources and where crisis management appears to be the default setting.  Nonetheless, the practice of appointing doctors who do not hold the correct registration to consultant posts is inappropriate and should cease.  Patients who require specialist care should receive it from a registered specialist.  There are potentially significant indemnity issues that arise from non-specialist doctors working as consultants in an under-resourced and overstretched health service.<br\/><br\/>Consultant-delivered care, it is worth reminding ourselves, is associated with better clinical outcomes for patients, increased patient safety and more efficient use of healthcare resources.  However, we strongly contend that this present issue is just part of a wider problem, one which has culminated in the Irish public health service not being the employer of choice for medical personnel, and the profoundly concerning circumstance in which consultant posts are advertised but not filled.  This was the case with 22 of 84 closed consultant recruitment campaigns in 2016.<br\/><br\/>Why has this come about?  It is important to go back to basics.  The current consultant contract, to which I have already alluded, contains a series of pay promises that were not honoured and that are now the subject of costly litigation.  No other group of public servants who had signed contracts in good faith would ever be treated in this fashion.  Furthermore, consultant salaries were unilaterally and unfairly reduced by 30% in 2012.  Again, no other group of public servants was singled out and treated in this fashion.  While the work of the IMO has ameliorated much of the effects of this cut, the price that we had to pay was a longer pay scale with lower starting and finishing points and very significant reduction in pensions for consultants appointed since 2012.  Less well remembered from that time were attempts by the then Minister for Health to introduce a consultant level 1 role that would sit below the existing consultant cohort.  This strain of thinking, viewing consultants not as a valuable resource but as an obstacle to be overcome, continues to influence and infect policy-making today.  The health service, however, suffered dreadful reputational damage.  Why would highly trained specialists who operate in a global market work in a system that could dismiss their contractual entitlements in such an offhand fashion?  It is for this very reason that 450 consultant posts, posts for which there once would have been fierce competition, now lie vacant or are filled on a temporary basis only.  When taken in the context of our comparative shortage of doctors, we have 2.9 practising physicians per 100,000 population, compared to an EU average of 3.4 per 100,000 population.  This should be profoundly troubling for any party interested in health service delivery.  In a recent IMO survey, over one quarter of consultants indicated that they were considering taking up a post abroad in the foreseeable future, while over 70% believe that their remuneration, training supports and access to colleagues would be improved by moving abroad.  In summary, we have a public health system which struggles to recruit doctors into consultant posts and which struggles increasingly to retain those doctors once appointed.<br\/><br\/>This is the backdrop against which non-specialists are appointed to specialist posts.  Long hours, poor access to supports and inability to deliver the type of care for which consultants have trained have served to turn a generation of talented medics off the idea of working in the Irish public health service.  We cannot afford to alienate these doctors.  This is because there are approximately 2,700 consultants in the public system, when the Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing recommended a figure of 4,400.  However, patients must be seen, and the service requires that consultant appointments be made.<\/p><p>It must never be the responsibility of the patient to determine whether their specialist is in fact a specialist; that is the responsibility of the employer.  Patients must have confidence that their consultant is a specialist and that the care they receive is of the appropriate standard.  <br\/><br\/>I will finish with a quote from the consultant survey that the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, conducted last year.  We gave respondents the opportunity to provide us with a comment.  Many of those comments were eye-opening, but the one that struck me most was provided by a recently appointed consultant, who wrote:<\/p><blockquote>I would resign now, except that I have to pay a mortgage and provide for my family.  I&rsquo;m sorry I came back. <\/blockquote><p>The blocks to specialist recruitment to consultant posts must be addressed as a matter of urgency. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar Gilligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":296,"content":"<p>We are here because media reports suggested there are approximately 650 consultants not on the specialist register.

The council is in discussion with the HSE about that number of individuals, as the HSE has mentioned.

How do those people get on the specialist register, if they want to stay in Ireland?  <\/p> <p>  I also want to raise the issue of the grandfather clause.  I spoke to a person a number of months ago who was employed pre-2008.  That person has made a number of attempts, through that person's specialist area, to get onto the specialist register and on each occasion, was told that people were not aware of what the process was.  In the last 12 months that person has been in contact with the Medical Council to ask what the process was.  That person was advised by the Medical Council that it did not have a process for getting on the specialist register for someone who took up a job pre-2008.  Can that be clarified?  What is the process for people who were employed pre-2008 who are not now on the specialist register but who have been practising for quite a long time in this country?  Those people are saying to me that the Medical Council has advised that it is not aware of the process in place.  Perhaps the people who not on the specialist register of whom the witnesses are aware could be communicated with to advise them what the process is.  The information I have is that these people do not know what the process is and that the Medical Council was not able to advise them.  The institutions they work for were unable to assist them either.  Perhaps the witnesses can clarify.<\/p> <p>  For those who are post-2008, I presume there would be no difficulty in communicating with them to advise what the process is.  Has there been communication with those people to date or will it be done at this stage?  <\/p> <p>  A specialist training programme was set up where people are on the programme for a number of years, go through the system and are then entitled to apply for consultant posts here.  Of the number who have come through the training process under the specialist training programme over the past ten years, what percentage have stayed in Ireland?  Does that programme now need to be reviewed in order to keep people in Ireland?

I was asked about overseas graduates entering specialist training.  There is a difference between EU and non-EU graduates.  EU graduates have an automatic right to enter basic specialist training and then higher specialist training as long as they do their entry exams and so on along the way and are appropriately assessed.  For non-EU graduates, it is a more complex programme.  They must have a certificate of equivalent experience to the Irish internship.  We have that in place for a number of countries including Pakistan, for those people who started their internships after January 2009, Sudan, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa after 1 July 2006, and Malaysia, the UK and Malta.  That was set up under the Act and the council has to consider the equivalent certificate of experience and that would exempt the applicant from doing the examination.<\/p> <p>  In order to deal with the significant number of people trying to register in Ireland, we established an adjudication group with representatives from Ireland and overseas to determine the requirements to ensure we had a high standard of doctors finishing their internships before we would register them here.  After reviewing evidence based on the quality of medical schools, quality of internships, the time taken and type of work done, the adjudication group recommended that internships undertaken in the countries I mentioned met the council's standards.  In addition, a person seeking to take up a training post in Ireland must have performed a higher examination.  He or she must demonstrate a level of education and training above the internship.<\/p> <p>  The current situation is disadvantageous to a number of doctors working in Ireland in that they have sufficient qualifications to work here but, due to legislation, they do not qualify to get onto training schemes.  One can have two doctors working on the same clinical team, one of whom is on a formal training scheme run by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland or the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland while the other is not eligible for that scheme.  We have had representations from a number of junior doctors and countries like Nigeria and India to try to deal with this.  The proposed amendments to the Act, which have been agreed between the council and the Department of Health, would get rid of that variation and allow those who are working here and providing good service to the country access to the training scheme.  It would also help the public by encouraging those people who are doing a job here to stay in the long term.  A lot of them come here to try to get on a training scheme.  When they cannot, they leave to go to Australia, Canada and so on.  As such, we are losing a valuable resource there.  I hope that clarifies matters.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke referred to people pre-2008 who did not grandfather across and who are now seeking to get onto the specialist register.  We have a standard process to assess these individuals.  That process is available on our website.  When someone makes an application, he or she is told what documents and evidence are required.  That comes to the council and the documentation and evidence are provided to the relevant postgraduate training body for surgeons, psychiatrists or physicians, which reviews the documentation and reverts to the council with a recommendation for the registration committee, which I chair.  As such, I know the process.  While the process is predicated on a person being in training today, we make allowances for the fact that someone might have trained a number of years ago.  We take into consideration the fact that conditions and requirements were different in 2002 than today.  In some situations, a college assessing an application might consider that by today's standards, an applicant does not meet the requirements for specialist registration.  In committee meetings, however, we consider the evidence the doctor has sent to us and consider what was in place when he or she was in training.  On a significant number of occasions, we have agreed to recommend that those people go on the specialist register.  Such a recommendation goes to the full council meeting for approval.  In a small number of situations, there might be a reason the doctor cannot be registered on the specialist register.  In such situations, a doctor has a right of appeal and can go before an assessment group and that assessment will go to the whole council, which can make a recommendation.  There is a clear process and we are cognisant of the issues for someone who trained a number of years ago.  We make allowances for that.<\/p> <p>  People coming to the country post-2008 go through the same assessment process.  We also make allowances for what training they have done and when they have done it.  Again, the assessment goes out to the relevant postgraduate training bodies and comes back to my committee where we will make a final decision.  Again, while we make allowances for people who have trained in different locations and at different times, we try to ensure they meet the relevant standard to practice in today&rsquo;s environment in Ireland.  All of that information is available on the council's website.  Some people can be put off by the requirements regarding relevant evidence and documentation.  For instance, if someone worked in the UK or Australia 15 years ago, it may be difficult to get proof that he or she worked in a certain hospital or carried out certain procedures.  However, we make allowances for that.  If there is any way for us to assist a doctor to achieve specialist registration where we think it is appropriate, we have no issue doing it.  If the Senator feels we should communicate that to doctors and make it more visible on our website, we have no issue doing that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke's final question was on the percentage of doctors who train in Ireland and leave.  I cannot provide a figure off the top of my head but we know it is an issue.  Some doctors do their basic training and then leave before they do their higher training.  Some doctors leave after their internships while others complete their higher training but leave due to issues around consultant recruitment and get consultant posts overseas.  We are trying to assess those numbers at present but I cannot give the Senator a figure off the top of my head.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anthony Breslin"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>The specific figure I am looking for is the number of those people who have completed the senior training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#G00300","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I understand.

This is not surprising because the Medical Practitioners Act does not give the Medical Council a role in the employment status of doctors within the health system.  It also does not give the Medical Council the status of regulator of hospitals or employers.  If it did, we would be a very different body with different powers and, presumably, very different resources.  In terms of the doctors who are self declared, the self-declaration does not give them any status.  The workforce intelligence report, which we compile and has been well received by stakeholders, is a snapshot of, and a source of information about, the medical workforce.  It is very useful, particularly when we know there are lots of stresses and strains in that workforce and very high emigration.  It is a useful tool but, in and of itself, it does not confer any status on anyone.  What we are discussing is to how to uphold standards in the profession.  Obviously, the Medical Council would be, and is, extremely concerned if consultant posts are not being filled by people who meet the specialist qualification.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Have all of Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's questions been answered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#H00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#H00300","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>The remaining questions were for the other stakeholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. William Prasifka"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>On Senator Colm Burke's question of whether communication has issued, in terms of the cohort of the public health sector about which we are speaking now, there are 127.

By way of clarification, because I would not like to mislead the committee, under the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003, employees can acquire a contract of indefinite duration.  Within the cohort post-2008, we have ten that will acquire a contract of definite duration.  In terms of the section 39 agencies, as the Deputy will be aware - this has been the subject of discussion by this committee - section 39 staff are not our employees.

The question is why do we have 450 vacant consultant posts throughout the country.  The reason for this is clear - Ireland is not regarded as an attractive place to work.  Why is that?  It is because we have a dishonoured consultant contract, significant cuts to consultants' pay, at three times that of all other public sector workers, and because consultants, particularly surgical colleagues, looking at potentially taking up a position in Ireland are finding that there is no operating theatre time available to them in the hospitals to which they are to be appointed or there is no outpatient clinical available to them.  They also may not have the administrative support they require or they not have a team to provide the care that they wish to provide.  As a result, they are choosing to remain where they are, which may be Canada, America, Australia or the UK and the patients of Ireland are missing out on this talent.  This is a very real impact.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the unfilled consultant posts, it is fair to say that services are not being provided to patients.  As I have stated previously in this committee, patients who require stroke care are not receiving it in as timely a manner as they would if there was a consultant in post.  Patients requiring surgery are waiting longer because we do not have the number of surgeons that we need to provide the care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar Gilligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Patients are being impacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#H01000","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":320,"content":"<p>They are very definitely being impacted, which is why it is key that we address this matter with a level of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peadar Gilligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Deputy Murphy O'Mahony also asked about the training period.  Most young people, when they qualify as a doctor and finish their internship, need time to find their feet.  They need time to consider what they want to do long term.  It is generally at this point that doctors would do two years of general training, usually in medicine.  They then enter some specialty training.  Following the sub-specialty training, they go abroad to round off their professionalism and to gain more experience.  A problem arises when in the two years before they get into specialist training they go abroad.  When they finish their specialist training they will go abroad.  Whereas the system here almost shuns junior doctors or doctors in training, when they go abroad they are embraced with open arms.  If they want to do more work and treat more patients they are given access to the resources, staff and administrative support they need to do so.  I know from direct personal experience of going abroad that when doctors go abroad they are treated very well.  If one wants to treat more patients everyone is delighted and one is given immediate access to whatever one wants.  There is no delay.  Doctors from experience at home know that the system is not conducive to providing excellence, either clinical, academic or training.  Young talented people see the disconnect between what is possible abroad and what pertains at home and they take a message from it.  They are not valued at home but they are valued abroad and so they emigrate.  We are exporting fully trained doctors to the rest of the world such that our health system is dependent on foreign-trained doctors.  We import doctors from poorer countries.  We take into our health care system doctors who have been trained in developing and Third World countries and as such we are not doing their countries of origin any justice.  At the same time, we are exporting large numbers of fully trained, confident medical professionals to thrive and practice abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>A double whammy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#H01300","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>To add to what Dr. Ryan said, currently there are approximately 200 Irish trained doctors who completed their intern year last year working in hospitals in Perth.  This is replicated across other parts of the English speaking world.<\/p><p>The major concern we have is that they are not coming back, they are remaining and going on to other posts and completing their training abroad.  We are training a sufficient number of doctors at graduate level, but we are losing them.  The key question is why that is the case.  I have been in this post for approximately ten years, but prior to that I worked as a civil servant in the Department of Finance.  During a previous recession, we had a golden rule in the Civil Service at the time that in spite of the financial difficulties the State would not breach contracts.  If I were to reflect on the past ten years, I would say the root cause of this problem is the fact that the State and the health service management is party to persistent and blatant breaches of contracts.  The examples are fairly obvious, the 2008 contract which was agreed with consultants ten years ago still has not been honoured.  It has been ignored.  That is sending a very negative message to professionals who are in very high demand internationally.  To sum up, it means that the longer serving consultants today, partly because of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, but also significantly because of the breach of contract are being paid 30% less than they should have been if the contract was honoured effective from 1 June 2009.  The new entrant consultants are being paid 45% less than was agreed practically ten years ago.  Of course, other jurisdictions have moved on in the interim and they have been increasing salaries.  The big difference is that highly trained professionals are embraced in other jurisdictions and in other hospital settings whereas, unfortunately, the opposite is the case here.  To resolve this problem one has to address and resolve those issues, the breach of contract and the discrimination against new entrants.  I think that is the key to the resolution of the problem.  We did not have that problem prior to those two developments. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#H01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Varley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Where is the lack of understanding in the Department of Health and the HSE about what is the central issue?

I personally believe that we urgently need to attack the issue of recruitment and retention.  It is a fundamental issue and feeds back to many of the other issues that create unhappiness from consultant to trainee consultant level.  Some of those steps include making Ireland a very good place to work.  Other improvements include optimising the process of appointing consultants so that it is a kind of one-stop-shop rather than having a number of steps and reducing as much as we can isolated or silo thinking and joining things up as best we can.  I argue that we are losing trainees at all stages and that we should make the end, that is being a consultant or a general practitioner, so attractive that people want to stay rather than leave.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#J00800","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.  I was very interested in the very desolate picture painted by Dr. Peadar Gilligan and others.  It is true and we all understand the difficulties in filling posts throughout the health services.  Some of the issues have been in existence for years, even before the downturn in the economy.  I served on one health board and I can recall distinctly posts being left unfilled for some considerable time because it was not possible to find suitably qualified people to fill the positions.  I think it is exacerbated by some of the contracts on offer in other countries.  It is possible to get a two or three year tax-free lucrative contract in the Middle East.  We cannot compete in this jurisdiction with that.  We need to bear that in mind.<\/p> <p>  I take the point made by Dr. Gilligan that we tend to dumb down the morale and the quality of the services in Ireland by constantly criticising them, even where criticism is not warranted.  That is not taking away from the fact that we do have the right to a good reliable health service that we can be proud of.  We want that to happen. <\/p> <p>  We need to understand that all staff throughout the public service suffered salary cuts.  It was a very sad thing at the time to break contracts.  The options available at that time are well known.

The cuts were drastic and severe, but I would like that to be borne in mind.<\/p> <p>  There is a figure of 450 vacancies; has that figure increased or decreased in the past number of years?

The people we would look to bring in as consultants, the Irish-trained doctors, would tend not to go to the Middle East.  They would be more likely to go to the UK, Canada or Australia.  They would pay tax in those jurisdictions but they would also have access to a far greater range of supports, work shorter hours and so on.  There are other factors around that.  There are remuneration issues too.  The Deputy asked if the number of empty consultant posts is going up or down.  The figure is probably tipping up slightly.

We are talking about doctors going to the Middle East and I know it is related but the committee meeting today is about doctors working as consultants in Ireland who are not on the specialist register.  That is why we are here.  We are all aware of the CervicalCheck scandal that has emerged over the last few days.  It is causing a lack of confidence between the public and their doctors.  It is clear, in the case of Vicky Phelan, that her doctor knew about not a false negative but a missed screening of cancer in 2011, did not tell her and did not want to tell her.  We know that 13 other hospitals had doctors who did not share the information.  It is fracturing trust between the public and their doctors.  There are big issues to ask about the level of trust between doctors and the HSE.  That is where we are this week.  We hear that not only may patients now be worried that their doctors are not sharing everything with them but that their consultant is not a consultant.  What we have heard this morning is shocking.  A professional organisation states \"it has become apparent that these most basic [professional] standards are not being observed when filling an increasing number of consultant posts and there is a [grave] concern that this development is not in the best interests of patient care.\"  That is what we are here to talk about.  Who is responsible for this?  Is it the Medical Council?  Is it the HSE?  Is it the Department?  Is there another body that we are not aware of?  I understand that there are no legal definitions for consultants but for specialists.  In the eyes of the public, in layman's terms, people hear that their consultant may not be a consultant.  Whose responsibility is it to make sure that, when a member of the public is referred to a consultant, that man or woman is in fact a registered consultant?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#K01500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I might address that.

Frequently, service providers such as hospitals or mental health services, must make a decision about whether to provide no service or to provide a service with somebody who is not on the specialist division of the register acting at consultant level who frequently, I think, has comparable experience, if not certified training, with those individuals who have registered with the Medical Council on the specialist division of the register.  That is one of the issues that is quite important to think about.  They are not doctors who, in my experience, do not have relevant experience and training.  They are doctors who do not have certification in that regard, which is different.  As Ms Mannion has outlined, they work in a slightly different environment where there is more mentoring rather than stand-alone work, as consultants tend to work.  It is worth thinking about where these posts are located.  They are mainly in smaller level 3 and 4 hospitals, in community mental health services and in hard-pressed specialties such as anaesthesia, surgery and medicine.

Doctors are withholding important information from patients in some cases to the point that, when referring to the ethical duty of consultants and activities relating to CervicalCheck, the Taoiseach said in the Chamber yesterday that the guidelines \"are not optional and doctors may be struck off for not following them\".  We have heard today that there are non-consultant hospital doctors who are not sitting the exams and that there are also non-consultant hospital doctors who we bring into this country, who are good enough to work in our hospitals but who are not worthy of further training.  We have a bizarre system of apartheid within our hospital system whereby we have one hospital doctor from Pakistan, Sudan or South Africa who is allowed to train and another from Japan, South Korea or Canada who is not allowed to train.  These are serious issues.  In terms of what we are hearing with regard to, for example, a member of the public believing he or she is talking to a specialist in circumstances where that individual is not, in fact, a specialist, will the professional bodies and the Medical Council indicate if there is a clinical risk involved or if this is simply an administrative issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#M00500","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#M00600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>There were some comments recently that this, to some extent, was about mitigating risk.  However, that is not a culture of excellence.  It is not a culture of providing the best possible care that the patient deserves.  I have commented that risk could be mitigated by mentoring but many of the people who are appointed to consultant posts and who are not on the specialist register are appointed in smaller, more remote hospitals where the possibilities of mentoring would be minimal.  An additional complication arises from the fact that sometimes - not infrequently - doctors who are not on the specialist register are appointed to act as consultants and then receive a contract of indefinite duration and are thereby incorporated into the system for good.  The problem about all this is it does not prioritise excellence or quality.  It actually may prevent a hospital developing.  There are situations that might arise where there may be a number of consultants in a smaller, more peripheral hospital who are not on the specialist register.  Then that hospital becomes uniquely unattractive for a well trained, broadly experienced consultant to come back and work in.  This practice might stymie the development of some of the smaller feeder or peripheral hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>If I could ask Dr. Ryan for the short version of that answer.

It is a significant point and is part of the reason we are here today.  He referenced the public service contract and the drastic and severe cuts to those.  The financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation was superimposed on a contract that had never been honoured.  Superimposed on that again was a 30% pay cut on all future consultants.  Despite our best efforts to have that 30% cut reversed, it has not happened to the extent that it should have.  Undoubtedly, that has had a massive effect on morale and on our ability to recruit and retain.<\/p> <p>  I teach specialist registrars on leadership.  Around the time of the 30% cut being announced, I asked what their response would be to it at that stage in their careers.  In unison, they said they would leave the profession, and that has come to pass.  We have an opportunity to get this right and address the matter.  We need to treat people doing the same job with the same qualifications to do that job, and working every bit as onerously as their existing colleagues, the same way.

I am sorry I was late and if I am repeating questions that have been asked, I apologise in advance.  Following Deputy Durkan's questions, somebody made a comment - I think it was Dr. Breslin - that there was a marginal increase in complaints regarding people on the non-specialist register.  Are there data to show how this has resulted in disciplinary action?  There could be many complaints about somebody but they may not be held up.  The key data we need to know are whether, with this marginal increase, these people are more or less likely than the regular guy to have disciplinary action taken against them.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman recently mentioned standards.  Can Ms Mannion tell us today that the public can be assured that these doctors are competent to perform their roles?  It is a fairly simple question for the head of human resources.  Who is liable if somebody on this register makes a catastrophic error?  Would it be the hospital manager or the Health Service Executive?  There has been reference to indemnity insurance.  If the indemnity insurance is not covering it and these people are employed by the State under this set-up, is it the responsibility of the State Claims Agency?<\/p><p>Who is paying?  Are these people value for money, do they do the same job as hospital consultants?  Do they do the same rate of on-call and is their net income in the year the same or higher?  Is it cheaper to employ someone who is not up to the same standard?  My understanding from anecdotal evidence is that these people are not performing the same on-call duties as regular hospital consultants.  On-call is included in regular non-locum consultant contracts.  In the current contract are they paid an hourly rate and are we getting the same bang for our buck as for a regular consultant?<br\/><br\/>I am very concerned that these individuals seem to be channelled into small peripheral hospitals.  When the hospital constantly employs locums and there is nobody <i>in situ<\/i>taking responsibility it seems very obvious, without doing any study, that there will be a drop in standards in that hospital and that will have a snowball effect.  When there is a drop in standards it is not an attractive place to work.  No Irish qualified hospital consultant wants to be responsible legally or ethically for people who are not up to scratch working under them.  The answer probably will be that this is a false economy.  Somebody spoke about recruitment and retention, Mr. Gilligan said that when consultant salaries were cut by 20% or 30% consultants were leaving the country.  Logically, if the locum costs 30% more we have made a bit of a bags of things because it is costing more to keep a lower standard of individual in employment.<br\/><br\/>Could somebody elaborate on the comment about locally appointed versus centrally appointed?  My understanding was that HSE recruitment was central and if this is a local issue are the same governance issues in place?If the HSE has bypassed the proper methods of centralised recruitment to do it locally what is the damage to the system?  The witnesses spoke about legislation drafted to overcome the barriers that prevent people getting on the consultant register.  Does anybody on the panel have any issues with this legislation?  Are there any concerns that this proposed legislation will in any way diminish the standards of Irish hospital consultants?  Are we doing something that will lead to inferior quality?  Is there, or has there been, any training programme put in place to get these people up to scratch such that a person doing the job competently wants to be a consultant but there is a technical barrier?  Is there a programme to bring these people to consultant level with perhaps a pay cut in the intervening period?  It seems logical that if the parameters of different countries are not aligned we would have some sort of get up to scratch course that would be approved and competency levels would have to be reached and assessed.  Of those in locum positions how many have signed temporary contracts and how many are Irish graduates?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#N02100","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":455,"content":"<p>Many of the 127 not on the specialist register are in the small hospitals such as Cavan, Letterkenny, Portlaoise and Tullamore.

If I ask a consultant colleague for his opinion, I expect an opinion from him that is valid, appropriate and discerning, not an opinion from somebody else who is mentoring him.  The whole point of appointing a consultant is to appoint a substantial person who can practise independently.  The whole notion of bringing them up to scratch is really a nonsense because they are either an independent medical practitioner or they are not.  If they are not up to scratch, they should not be doing the job.<\/p> <p>  This is a confusion of risk and quality.  In any other industry, like the aeroplane or transport industries, the industry does not act to mitigate risk, it acts to improve quality.  It does not wait until the train or the aeroplane crashes and a person ends up in the courts or in front of the Medical Council; it ensures that the pilots are appropriately trained, the aeroplanes are appropriately maintained and good quality processes are in place.  A basic quality process is to ensure that the staff who are supposed to practise independently are appropriately trained and qualified.  It should never come to the fact that someone detects there is a problem only when a doctor ends up in front of the Medical Council or the High Court for malpractice.  There should be quality programmes, and a basic part of a quality programme is to stick with basic professional standards and to ensure that all consultant staff who can practise independently are up to scratch and appropriately qualified.  This is just the most basic standard that we would use to base any quality programme on.  The whole notion that one would wait until somebody had caused a problem with the Medical Council and then flag up a risk is a problem.  It is not prioritising quality of care, excellence of standards and an aspiration for either academic or clinical excellence.

It is one of the main issues causing difficulty for consultants, namely, that we cannot recruit and replace in a timely fashion.  If we are filling posts now, we are, in effect, filling gaps with people who are not meeting the HSE standards or the Medical Council requirements, as we see them.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan raised questions about the recruitment crisis.  While there were always challenges in recruiting in previous decades, in the last decade the scale of the challenge has become far more prolonged and deep to the extent that a quarter of the posts advertised the year before last had no applicants and possibly another quarter had one applicant, so, in effect, for half of the advertised posts, there was no competition.  On balance, we would be talking about the rest of the posts having, say, two applicants and let us not forget there could be five or six consultant anaesthetist posts advertised at any one time so, in fact, we could be seeing similar people applying for similar posts.  The scale of competition is much reduced compared with the position prior to 2008.  This comes back to the absolute breach of trust and the failure to honour basic contract terms, which is very unfortunate.<\/p> <p>  Another development we note is the increase in the number of consultants resigning from their posts to practise in private hospitals or to practise abroad, which is a new and increasing phenomenon.  Again, I think this goes back to the breach of trust and also the lack of resources to provide timely care to patients.  The third development we note in recent times is that more and more consultants are considering working part-time because of the stress and lack of resources, and, no doubt, also because of the breach of contract.  Unfortunately, we are seeing a growing problem that is beginning to mushroom out into the system.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the luxury of seeing the most recent data circulated by the HSE but we were provided with data on where these posts were back in October.  All I would say is that this is becoming more and more extensive and, at that time, it was affecting posts in 15 specialties throughout 15 acute hospitals and ten mental health services.  In fact, the list I have seen suggests it is also impacting tertiary hospitals and cancer centres.

We should question people, when they are considering retiring, not in order to push them out but just to get a sense of what needs to be done to minimise the gaps.  The point Mr. Varley made is a fair one.  We want to minimise the gaps and have an efficient and effective recruitment process.  That is only part of what we are trying to do.  The problems with recruitment are not single-factorial but multifactorial and that is clear from the discussions we have had here this morning.  I would see it as my responsibility to make sure we improve all of those processes as best we can.<\/p><p>There was a question from Deputy O'Connell on value for money I would like to address directly.  The best way to do things is to do things the correct way for the correct reason.  That is what we should be aspiring to do.  We should not have protracted periods with doctors working as locums at consultant level.  We should aim to minimise that.  One of the targets I am going to set is to reduce our dependence on locums right through the system.<\/p><p> I would also like to answer another of the Deputy's questions on locally appointed and centrally appointed staff.  Centrally appointing staff to a substantive post includes going through a process called CAAC, the consultant appointment approval committee; and the approval of a consultant through a competition either at hospital level or through the PAS, the Public Appointments Service.  For many locum posts, this process does not operate; there is a short-term gap, somebody retires or is ill or there is an extra post and that post is then filled locally rather than centrally.  That is the difference between locally and centrally appointed or centrally approved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#P01400","nonspeaker":"Professor Frank Murray","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I understand that.

Many hospitals around the country are relying on locum agencies to provide them with staff to provide care to their patients on an ongoing basis.  It is all reflective of what Deputy O'Connell referred to as \"a bags of things\" having been made of recruitment and retention.  We clearly need to get this right.  We need to make it attractive to provide specialist care in Irish hospitals throughout the country from level 1 all the way to level 4.<\/p> <p>  The only way we are going to achieve that is by meaningfully addressing the contractual issues of consultants.  I return to Deputy Durkan's point.  We do have to realise that we are competing in an international market for specialists.  It has to be attractive for people to work here.  That certainly includes pay but it also includes the supports necessary to provide specialist care.  It includes the supports that are necessary to continue because many of our specialists have a background in research and training and education.  They require support in the delivery of that as well.  Let us move from a bags of things to getting things right.

When I compare what we do now for patients in terms of medications and technology with the provision 17 or 18 years ago, and my clinical colleagues will support this, everything has improved dramatically in Ireland.  That is one place where our healthcare spend goes.  The other two big factors involved in the reason life expectancy has increased by five years, which is very dramatic, are the reduced rate of tobacco consumption and a fall from the peak in 2001 in alcohol consumption, which, as I said here previously, is still a dreadful problem here in Ireland.  If we are to continue to improve our life expectancy, improving on those three factors must come into play.

First, we have not invested adequately in capacity in terms of capital spend during the past decade or two.

Second and very important, our assessment indicates that we are not spending as much as others in terms acute hospital spend on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis.  We have to segment out the expenditure.

As the Chairman said, I am Deirdre Walsh, principal officer in the professional regulation unit and I am joined by my colleague, Aidan Tumbleton, assistant principal.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman outlined the Houses of the Oireachtas are being asked to approve the following two regulations in draft: the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95 (3)) (Variation of title: Dietician) Regulations 2018; and the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Section 95 (3)) (Variation of title: Speech Therapist) Regulations 2018.  These regulations are being made pursuant to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The Act provides for the protection of the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct, education, training and competence through statutory registration of the health and social care professionals designated under the Act.  Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of registration of practitioners and the statutory protection of professional titles.  The use of protected titles is restricted to practitioners granted registration under the Act.  Registrants must comply with a code of professional conduct and ethics and are subject to \"fitness to practice\" rules similar to those applying to nurses, midwives and doctors.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards for the professions, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters, and the Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies are collectively known as CORU.<\/p> <p>  The Act prohibits a person whose name is not on the register from using the title of a designated profession and provides that CORU may initiate a criminal prosecution summarily to enforce the prohibition on a designated title's misuse.  The title of dietitian is currently specified under section 79 of the 2005 Act for the exclusive use of qualified professionals registered with the Dietitians Registration Board.  However, the US spelling of dietician with a \"c\" also appears to be in use in Ireland.  CORU report that it has received a number of referrals concerning persons who are not registered with the Dietitians Registration Board using the title \"dietician\".<\/p><p>Legal advice has been obtained to the effect that a prosecution initiated against an unregistered person using the variant spelling dietician would be unlikely to succeed unless the title is prescribed pursuant to section 95 (3) of the Act.  The purpose of the first draft regulation is to protect the public by restricting the use of the variant title dietician to qualified professionals registered with the Dietitians Registration Board.  <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>The Dietitians Registration Board has written to the Department formally requesting that regulations be made to prescribe the title of dietician as a variant of the specified title of dietitian.  The registration board has also furnished the opinion of legal counsel, who recommends the variant title be prescribed to remove ambiguity concerning its use.  Representations have also been received from the Chairman of the Board of the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute requesting that the variant title dietician is protected.  <br\/><br\/>On the prescription of title of speech therapist as a variant title of speech and language therapist,<b><\/b>the title of speech and language therapist is currently protected under section 79 of the 2005 Act for the exclusive use of qualified professionals registered with the Speech and Language Therapists Registration Board.  Historically, professionals were referred to as speech therapists, and, although the profession has long since adopted the title of speech and language therapist, practitioners are often referred to by the outdated title.  Legal advice has been obtained by Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, to the effect that a prosecution initiated against an unregistered person using the historic variation speech therapist would be unlikely to succeed unless the title is prescribed pursuant to section 95 (3) of the Act.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of the second draft regulation is to protect the public by restricting the use of the variant title speech therapist to qualified professionals registered with the Speech and Language Therapist Registration Board.  <br\/><br\/>The Speech and Language Therapist Registration Board has written to the Department requesting that regulations be made to prescribe the title of speech therapist as a variant of the specified title of speech and language therapist.  The registration board has also furnished the opinion of legal counsel, who recommends the variant title be prescribed to remove ambiguity concerning its use.  <br\/><br\/>The legal position is that<b><\/b>section 95(3) of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 Act provides that the Minister for Health, after consulting the registration board of a designated profession and any organisations that he or she considers appropriate, may, by regulation prescribe one or more than one title that is a variant of the title designated in the Act for the profession.  Section 95(7) provides that:<\/p><blockquote>A regulation may be made under subsection (3) only if&mdash; (a) draft of the proposed regulation has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and <br \/><br \/>(b) a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.<\/blockquote><p><b><\/b>The regulations have been laid before both Houses. The Minister made a motion to move both regulations in the D&aacute;il on 24 April 2018, and as the Chairman noted, in the Seanad on 25 April.

I will start by acknowledging the important role that Vicky Phelan has played in highlighting a number of major weaknesses in how people have experienced our national cervical screening programme, CervicalCheck.  The Minister has publicly commented on his swift action so far to address these issues.  He has also expressed his gratitude in public to Vicky Phelan, which I will do here again, for her courage in bringing forward these issues.  Without her, we would not have the opportunity to learn the lessons that I am confident we will learn from this circumstance.  Without attempting to set out a comprehensive roll call, she adds her name to a range of other patients to whom we are grateful who had to come forward in similar circumstances to raise issues of public concern, leading to improvements in the system.  Not least of these are Susie Long, Rebecca O'Malley, R&oacute;is&iacute;n and Mark Molly and Shauna Keyes, but there are many others.  Our challenge will be to derive what value and learning we can from Vicky Phelan's experience, which she courageously brought forward, and use them to improve the system.<\/p> <p>  Vicky Phelan was diagnosed with cervical cancer in July 2014 and, sadly, was informed in 2017 that her cancer was incurable.  In 2014, CervicalCheck's clinical audit of Ms Phelan's 2011 smear test result, which was reported at the time as normal, identified a query squamous cell carcinoma.  However, Ms Phelan was not made aware of this finding until September 2017.  This delay has raised serious concerns about the processes for providing information to patients and clinicians.<\/p> <p>  Subsequent to the controversy that arose surrounding her case, the HSE initially advised that, between 2008 and early 2018, 1,482 cervical cancer cases were notified to CervicalCheck.  The majority were women who had already been referred for further investigation or for treatment by CervicalCheck.  As part of the clinical audit process, these notified cases were re-examined and a number were flagged for further cytology review.  In 208 of these cases, the cytology review recommendations differed from the original results.<\/p> <p>  Last Friday, 27 April, the HSE established a serious incident management team, SIMT, to oversee and direct the management of this incident.  The SIMT has reported that approximately 162 of the 208 women involved have now been informed of the outcome of the audit process.  Communication with these women is ongoing.  We have further details, which we would be happy to share with members.  I regret to say that 17 of the 208 patients are deceased.  Like the Minister, we express our sympathies to the families of those patients.<\/p> <p>  Arising from the work of the SIMT, and as outlined by the Minister last night on the floor of the D&aacute;il, the number of cases of cervical cancer notified to CervicalCheck - 1,482 - does not represent all of the cases of cervical cancer occurring in Ireland since the establishment of the programme in September 2008.  I regret to say that I do not at this point have the necessary information to confirm how many additional cases this might represent, but work has started on ascertaining what that number is.  We will detail that work.  The Minister has directed that immediate steps be taken so that information from the national cancer registry on any additional case of cervical cancer that occurred during that period is provided to the CervicalCheck programme.  Any screening history that those additional cases may have - not all will necessarily have been screened - will be established.  If any of these women was screened through the CervicalCheck programme, her case will be reviewed in further detail, with cytology review where necessary.  A helpline has been in operation at the national cancer screening service since Friday and clinical staff are following up with women on their specific clinical questions.<\/p> <p>  Since 2008, some 3 million smears have been carried out by CervicalCheck.  It is important to note that the cervical screening test is not a diagnostic test, only a screening test, that is, a test to indicate the possibility of pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions, thereby identifying women who need to be referred for further investigation or follow-up.  Smear tests can produce false positive and false negative results.<\/p><p>Therefore, cervical cancer may well develop in the time interval between a negative screening test and the next scheduled screening in any cervical screening programme.  The current primary screening test used by CervicalCheck is a cytology test which is known to have low sensitivity, that is, it produces a not insignificant number of false negative results.  Naturally, many women are now concerned about their own health following the publicity surrounding CervicalCheck.  It is certainly our intention, if we may, to use the committee and its indulgence to reassure people about the performance of the programme in relation to those people.  In order to provide assurance, CervicalCheck will make the necessary arrangements to enable any woman who has had a CervicalCheck smear test to have a consultation with her GP, in order to help her determine whether she wishes to have a further test without charge.  These arrangements are currently being worked through and will be confirmed this week.  We will hear further detail of this over the course of the afternoon.<\/p><p> In addition, in February 2018, the Minister approved the introduction of primary HPV screening for cervical smear samples, and I can confirm that this will be introduced later this year.  A Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, health technology assessment has found that HPV screening would benefit women by making the screening process much more clinically effective as well as reducing unnecessary tests, and greatly elongating the interval between tests for individuals.<\/p><p> I would now like to turn to the steps that are being taken to ensure the integrity of the CervicalCheck screening programme.  Non-disclosure of information to affected patients has raised concerns for users within the health service.  Patients have an absolute right to be provided with honest, open and prompt communication about any adverse event that may have caused them harm.  This is underpinned in the medical practitioner's code of conduct and the HSE open disclosure policy.  The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which includes provisions that support open disclosure, became law last year.  These provisions were drafted to create a safe space for professionals to be open and transparent with patients in order that they would be given as much information as possible, as early as possible, including an apology where appropriate.  By doing this, we have taken away any fears that doctors may have in being open and apologising to patients, specifically, fears of creating legal liabilities for themselves.  There is no longer room for excuses.  The patient has a right to know and should be told.<\/p><p> The next step is to further strengthen and protect open and honest communications between patients and the health service by bringing forward proposals for mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable events.  A stand-alone patient safety Bill goes to Government next week to expedite this.  The Minister&rsquo;s intention is to have an independent statutory investigation to examine the CervicalCheck screening programme.  This investigation will have all the necessary powers to investigate the issues highlighted by Ms Phelan and will place particular focus on the quality assurance systems, clinical audit processes and communications with patients within the cervical screening programme.<\/p><p> As part of this, a comprehensive examination of the cervical screening programme in Ireland against international best practice and standards will be undertaken.  The investigation will also identify, within its terms of reference, any implications that may apply to other cancer screening programmes.  In addition to this statutory investigation, we are now working on putting in place, as a matter of urgency, an international clinical expert process to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review.  This panel will also produce an overall report to inform the statutory  investigation and the work of the international peer review group.  We are mindful of the need to provide support to these women and a liaison nurse specialist will co-ordinate the work of the expert group.  We intend to include patient advocates as part of that process also. <\/p><p> Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women aged between 25 and 39 years.  Every year in Ireland approximately 270 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and just under 100 deaths occur from it.  Cervical cells change slowly and take time to develop into cancer cells, making cervical cancer a preventable disease.  Even with the inherent challenges in screening, having regular smear tests can pick up early cell changes or pre-cancerous growths and reduce the risk of cervical cancer.  This is the scientific basis of screening.  I must emphasise how important it is that women continue to have their smears and take this test, which can and will continue to save lives.<\/p><p> It is our intention to take these necessary steps in order to ensure the integrity of the cervical screening programme while at the same time disseminating any learning to all cancer screening programmes.  These programmes are an important component of the progress that we have made over the past ten years in cancer survivorship for people in this country.  The Department is fully committed to the further development of our cancer services and to delivering the ambitious roadmap set out for these services as outlined in the national cancer strategy which was launched last year.  We will be happy to take any questions from the committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting to discuss the current issues surrounding the CervicalCheck Programme.  I am joined today by my colleagues Dr. Colm Henry, recently appointed as the HSE chief clinical officer; Dr. Jerome Coffey, national director of the national cancer control programme; Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director of the national women and infants programme; Ms Angela Fitzgerald, deputy national director of acute services; Mr. John Gleeson, programme manager of CervicalCheck; and Mr. Patrick Lynch, national director for quality assurance and verification and chair of the serious incident management team, SIMT.<\/p> <p>  I would like to begin by reiterating on behalf of the HSE my sincere apologies to all those women who have been affected and families involved in the CervicalCheck controversy, and others who although not directly involved have experienced any distress by what they have heard and read in recent days.  I also wish to state that I did contact Ms Vicky Phelan to apologise to her for the delay in telling her that her test results had been a false negative and I want to sincerely make that apology to her and her family again here today.<\/p> <p>  At the centre of this issue was our failure to communicate to the women that were the subject of the audit.  Those women should have been informed and that is something that will happen from now on.  It is essential that we re-establish confidence in our cervical screening programme, which is a critical public health initiative.<\/p> <p>  CervicalCheck, the HSE&rsquo;s national cervical screening programme, has provided a population-based cervical screening programme to the women of Ireland since 2008.  It is important to be clear and to understand that cervical screening is not a test for cancer, but a means of preventing it.  Cervical screening works by looking for changes in the cells of the cervix, the neck of the womb, using a smear test and cervical cytology.  The earlier abnormal cell changes are found, the easier they are to treat and the treatment of these changes in the cells of the cervix means that the risk of developing cervical cancer is reduced.  Screening is internationally accepted as a preventative health measure.  While it is recognised that no screening test is 100% accurate, cervical screening is the most effective method of reducing a woman&rsquo;s risk of developing cervical cancer.  By achieving and maintaining the targeted coverage rate of 80% as it currently does, CervicalCheck has the potential to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer significantly.<\/p> <p>  Since 2008, women in Ireland have been attending in increasing numbers.  CervicalCheck has achieved an 80% coverage rate among eligible women, a figure that is among the highest in EU countries.  Latest figures from National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, show that the incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland has reduced by around 7% per annum since the period from 2010 to 2015.  This means that fewer women will develop cervical cancer and there will be fewer deaths.<\/p> <p>  To date, CervicalCheck has provided 3 million cervical screenings to more than 1.1 million women.  It has detected more than 50,000 high grade pre-cancerous changes in women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without screening, would not have known they had pre-cancerous changes.  Furthermore the programme has detected more than 35,000 cases of low-grade cell changes and more than 1,200 cancers.<\/p> <p>  There are 15 clinics across the country which provide colposcopy services as part of the CervicalCheck programme.  Continued successful collaboration between the programme and colposcopy clinics nationwide has led to sustained improvements to colposcopy services and eliminated waiting lists.  The high standard of colposcopy has ensured that women who require a colposcopy are guaranteed timely access to a standardised level of quality-assured care.<\/p> <p>  In 2009 CervicalCheck participated in an external international peer review of the CervicalCheck quality assurance, QA, standards.<\/p><p>The international peer review panel consisted of those named on the printed version of the statement and I will not read the list out, subject to the agreement of the committee.  They are, however, a credible international set of experts.  It has been asserted that, in some way, the screening programme in this country is substandard to the US as it is asserted that the US screens every year.  However, the HIQA report of October 2009 on the evaluation of the use of resources in the national population-based cancer screening programmes and associated services presented the recommended screening interval internationally.  In the case of the USA, recommended intervals are initially two smears, one year apart, then every three years.  It is also important to note that much of the US system involves a self-select process, an opt-in which, in effect, is a voluntary presentation and not a calling or invitation system as in Ireland.  It is not an organised programme in that sense.<br\/><br\/>HIQA goes on to say in that 2009 report:<\/p><blockquote>A systematic review of the existing evidence base for the optimal age-range and screening interval for cervical screening was undertaken in order to determine if the current age-range (25-60 years) could be narrowed or the screening intervals increased.  Based on the literature review, the current age range and screening interval adopted in the CervicalCheck programme in Ireland would appear to be consistent with the international evidence base.<\/blockquote><p>The HIQA report also noted that CervicalCheck administration has achieved the ISO 9001-2000 quality certification and maintains this standard through regular internal and external audit.  A comprehensive smear taker training prospectus has also been developed and underpins a smear taking training programme developed and delivered in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, the National University of Ireland Galway, and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.<br\/><br\/>There has been much commentary on the outsourced CervicalCheck laboratory services.  In that regard, I would like to make the following comments.  A procurement process for the provision of cytology laboratory services was undertaken in December 2007 with the publication of a notice in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union <\/i>in line with public procurement regulations.  The requirement of the NCSS was that each potential contractor would need to meet certain criteria, including that they must hold third party accreditation from a recognised accreditation body to international standard ISO 15189; have capacity to screen a minimum of 25,000 cervical smear samples per year; have capacity and ability to process smears within a ten-day turnaround in order to facilitate the delivery of results to women within four weeks of their smear test; and hold independent quality accreditation of the service.<br\/><br\/>On completion of the procurement process, a private sector provider of laboratory services, Quest Diagnostics Inc., was appointed for the provision of cytology laboratory services.  In addition to the criteria above, each slide analysed by the laboratory is examined twice by two separate cytologists.  CervicalCheck, in line with public procurement guidelines, re-tendered for laboratory services in 2009 and again in 2012.  Following the 2009 procurement process, Medlab Pathology Limited was appointed along with the previous incumbent Quest Diagnostics Inc.  In 2012, a further tendering process took place and the two laboratories mentioned above were appointed under a HSE framework agreement.  This framework agreement is still active today and both Quest Diagnostics and Medlab Pathology are still providing cytology and HPV laboratory services, under contract, on behalf of CervicalCheck.<br\/><br\/>I now want to address the findings of the serious incident management team, SIMT, report.  I have submitted the full report, which is also available at <i>hse.ie<\/i>, to the committee with the opening statement so I will highlight some of the key issues here.  Over the past week there has been considerable public focus on, and concern about, the cervical screening service.  Much of this concern stems from an audit of 1,482 cases of cervical cancer reported to the programme in the period between 2008 and 2018.  The CervicalCheck clinical audit process examines the screening history of all notified cases of cervical cancer, with a date of diagnosis since the programme commenced in September 2008.  The cases covered by the audit were those cases of cervical cancer notified to the programme and not the larger number of cases notified to the National Cancer Registry for the same period.  The programme advised Department of Health officials on Friday evening that the figures were based on the cancer registry figures and it was on this basis that the Minister was briefed.  It was subsequently determined by the SIMT that this was incorrect.<br\/><br\/>The audit process is an opportunity to see if any aspect of a programme could be improved.  The process can also provide more detailed information to women on the reasons their cancer was not prevented, as well as information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening.  Of the 1,482 cases notified and logged to date, 442 cases, 29%, were flagged for review of one or more elements of the cervical screening pathway, which includes programme operation, screening, cytopathology and HPV testing, colposcopy or histopathology.  Cases are reviewed by an internal review group, with the support of an independent pathologist.  The most common review type, as expected in a cervical screening programme, is of cytology, that is, the smear test, due to its inherent limitations as a screening test.  Cytology reviews are performed internally by the original reporting laboratory, and by independent laboratories if a further opinion is required.<br\/><br\/>In February 2016, the programme commenced formally communicating review outcomes of historical notified cervical cancer cases where prior cytology had been reviewed to the consultant doctor looking after an individual woman diagnosed with cervical cancer.  All historical reviews were communicated to treating doctors by October 2016 and the programme has been communicating current cases since that date.  While the audit process established by CervicalCheck is seen as good practice and has the potential to make an important contribution to improving the quality of the programme, there was some evidence that the women whose cytology smear test had been reviewed as part of the audit process had not been informed either of the review or the outcome as it pertained to them.  The women whose cases were reviewed already had a diagnosis of cancer so the outcome of the review of their cytology smear test would not have changed their diagnosis or treatment.  They were entitled, however, to know that their case was reviewed and the outcome of that review.  This was particularly important where the review team drew conclusions that were different from the original interpretation of the smear result.<br\/><br\/>The SIMT established that there were 208 women who should have been communicated with in relation to the review process.  These were women where the CervicalCheck review team interpretation of their smear result was different from the original smear interpretation.  Of these, 175 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result and, based on the opinion of the review team, this would have led to a different clinical escalation, namely, a referral for biopsy or colposcopy.  Of the total, 33 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result but, based on the opinion of the review team, they would not have recommended different clinical management other than an earlier repeat smear.<br\/><br\/>On 30 April 2018, following the review of patient charts over the weekend, it was established that of the 208 women concerned, 46 women have already been communicated with and 162 women had not been told.  Each hospital group was then required to ensure that each of the 162 women who had not been told of the review outcome would be phoned on Monday, 30 April and Tuesday, 1 May 2018.  They would be offered an appointment to meet the appropriate senior clinician during the week ending Saturday, 5 May 2018.  There were 17 women in this cohort who have died.  It has been established that two of these women had the results of their review communicated to them before their death.  It is acknowledged that, in addition to a diagnosis of cancer, finding out at this stage that they were the subject of a review will be distressing.  The SIMT is confident that the clinicians meeting with these women or their next of kin will be very sensitive to the context of this information.<\/p><p>While the women who were the primary focus and concern of the work of the SIMT had all received a diagnosis of cancer at the time of their review and the review would not have changed the outcome, they were all entitled to know the review had been conducted and its outcome as it related to them.  This openness and transparency should lie at the heart of a caring and compassionate health care system.  Many women may be worried because of the recent coverage, and there is useful information available on .<br\/><br\/><b><i><\/i><\/b>During the course of its work, it became evident to the SIMT that the number of cases audited by the screening programme varied from the number of cases of cervical cancer reported to the National Cancer Registry over the same period.  The SIMT immediately took action, escalating this matter to me.  This, as the chief medical officer has already referenced, will result in the National Cancer Registry being mandated to share its data with the programme, the lists being reconciled, and an immediate audit of these remaining cases being undertaken.<br\/><br\/>I would like to conclude by saying that I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he is establishing a statutory investigation, which will be carried out by HIQA.  I also welcome the appointment of an international clinical expert panel to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review.  The HSE will fully co-operate with both processes to ensure we establish all of the facts surrounding what has occurred and, above all, so we can learn from what has happened and ensure it does not occur again.<br\/><br\/>Given that I started my career in the public service in BreastCheck, the recent events are indeed a personal blow to me.  I do not have many more weeks in my role.  Indeed, I have only a few months because, as members know, I announced some time ago I would not be remaining beyond the term of my current contract, and consequently I intend to devote the greater part of those weeks to addressing these issues.  In that regard, as I believe the Taoiseach confirmed earlier, I have appointed Mr. Damien McCallion, one of our senior national directors, currently responsible for emergency management, among other duties, to take charge of the national cancer screening service from tomorrow so all the issues that need to be worked through as we deal with this can be managed by him.  He will report directly to me.  I will be taking a very close personal interest in every aspect of this process.  The SIMT will continue its work also.<br\/><br\/>That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.  As this may be a prolonged meeting, witnesses and members may take a break after two hours, if they wish.  It is very important for the members and witnesses to note that the women at the centre of this controversy should remain our main focus.  The setting up of an inquiry that will seek the truth on this issue should concern us.  We should concentrate on that and not take political issues into account.  The issues that arise this evening relate to trust.  There has been a breakdown of trust.  There has been a loss of trust in the CervicalCheck programme.  There have been a breakdown in and failure of open disclosure.  There has been a destruction of confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.  That needs to be restored as quickly as possible.  Full disclosure might not have affected treatment but it certainly would have altered women's ability to respond to the information.  It might have afforded an opportunity to seek redress elsewhere, as Ms Vicky Phelan did.  Therefore, non-disclosure had a significant effect.  It raises issues regarding governance, accountability and the cultural change required in the HSE and the Department.<\/p> <p>  I have three questions to start the meeting.  The first is for Mr. John Gleeson.  How could open disclosure not be part of the CervicalCheck programme?  It seems quite difficult to understand.  The cervical cancer registry and the CervicalCheck database did not match.  How could that possibly be and how could there have been such a breakdown in communication?  My third question is for Mr. O'Brien.  Is it now possible to say we know all the information in regard to this issue?  Have we identified each person who requires a smear case audit but who has not had one thus far?  Has the total number of patients been identified?  Perhaps these questions could be addressed first.<\/p> <p>  Members will have ten minutes each for questions and answers.  Witnesses are advised to keep their answers as concise as possible, just as I hope members will keep their questions as concise as possible, to allow every member to engage.  Perhaps Mr. Gleeson might address the two questions addressed to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#NN00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":581,"content":"<p>On the Chairman's first question, on open disclosure, we started the process of cancer audit in 2010 with a view to ensuring quality assurance and continual improvement and through 2014 decided to review it and then commence, in line with the published HSE open disclosure policy of 2013, an evaluation of what that meant in screening terms, mostly in terms of defining serious incidents.  It did not make specific reference to screening, which is different.  One is dealing with people who do not have symptoms.  It is not like people in hospitals; it is a different cohort of the population.  Without trying to not do open disclosure, we went about trying to figure out how best to do it in respect of women we were concerned about because, after all, they had been diagnosed with cervical cancer.  We were looking at something before that point in time and how to communicate it but we did develop the process.  It took a considerable amount of time, for which I apologise, but the intent was always to let the women know.  We looked to practices in England and elsewhere to determine how that might best be done.  It was always felt that the treating clinician of the woman at that time was the best channel through which to communicate with her.  We would not know the context surrounding her current care and treatment at whatever stage she was at in her plan to address the diagnosis.  We did develop and implement the open disclosure and communication policy in respect of treating clinicians.  Admittedly there were certainly gaps, for which we apologise, in terms of making sure the information actually got to the women but our intention was always that information we had that related to a woman should be made accessible to her.<\/p> <p>  Could the Chairman repeat the second question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":582,"content":"<p>The second question was on the incompatibility of the National Cancer Registry and CervicalCheck.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#NN00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":583,"content":"<p>The National Cancer Registry is a different statutory body.

It does not operate the other way, however.  If the National Cancer Registry is registering a cancer &mdash; in our case, cervical cancer &mdash; it does not go the other way.  The National Cancer Registry was given access to the cervical screening register in order to be able to report, in an aggregate way, on the programme.  It is a question of whether, over time, we can reduce the incidence and whether the detection of cancer will start to move to an earlier stage to give a better prognosis.  The national screening service measure was under way to implement a data-sharing agreement in line with the forthcoming GDPR to make that communication two-way.  We also felt in the early years, however, that most of the women would not have engaged in cervical screening.

That is just by way of comment.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. O'Brien.  He stated at the press conference that he found out about what he describes as a failure to communicate - and perhaps he might want to revisit that description of what we are discussing today -  in the media.  I am interested in trying to get to the bottom of this.  A circular issued in 2016 is at the heart of the failure to communicate, as Mr. O'Brien describes it.  It advised clinicians simply to add a copy of the audit to the file and use their clinical judgment on whether to tell a woman something about her own health and, in a case where the poor unfortunate patient had died, to stick a note on the file.  When that circular was being drafted, and I understand it was signed by someone who was a member of the senior management team, senior clinicians and senior people in the HSE presumably were involved in drafting a circular of this nature.  It stretches credibility a bit for me that these people, members of Mr. O'Brien's senior team, would not have communicated to him on an issue as serious as this.  If we want to talk about open disclosure and being full and frank, I hope we can get away from what we have had in recent days, which is an endless round of people - mostly men as it goes and no disrespect intended to men - describing to women what it is like to have a smear test and how important it is.  I do not need any of that advice.  I have been having smear tests for 22 years, since I had my daughter.  I understand how important it is.  I also know it is not a diagnostic test and I understand it is a screening test.  It would probably be helpful if we could dispense with having to repeat that.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Brien give me some information as to who would have been involved in compiling that circular, because to me it seems that it came from a very senior level?  It strikes me as odd that it did not come across Mr. O'Brien's desk, but he is telling us the first he knew about it was in the media.  Perhaps he can talk to us about who was involved in compiling that circular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#PP00800","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. John Gleeson to tell us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#PP00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I was involved with the then clinical director of the screening programme in compiling it.

Even though we had layers of people, management, processes and pathways not one person over the years noticed that only half of the tests were being audited.  Collectively, for our health system, how does that make the witnesses feel?  It is absolutely mind-boggling that only half of tests have been audited since 2008.

Mr. O'Brien, initially there was a two-year contract for the outsourcing of cervical smears, which took place under his watch in 2008.  Was the two-year contract renewed or was it audited in order for the State to continue the contract?  Mr. O'Brien was in charge at the time.  In 2008, the decision was made by the then Minister to send the smears to America.  Mr. O'Brien outlined the procurement procedure involved and stated that serious concerns were raised in various quarters.  It would seem obvious to me that if domestic concerns had been expressed about the process then two years into it Mr. O'Brien, as the person in charge, should have reviewed the outcomes.  Perhaps I missed something in the opening statement.  Under the heading, the procurement of cytology laboratory services, in his opening statement he referred to capacity of a laboratory and the turnaround time.  I am reading his statement and can see mention of \"international standards\".  His statement seemed to dwell on speed of turnaround rather than on quality.  There is not much reference to quality.

I know that much has been said on the issue of public confidence.  I am not suggesting in any sense that the Deputy is taking us back in comparison, but it is worth pointing out that before the programme was established in 2008 - and this is a ballpark figure - we were doing somewhere in the region of 300,000 smears a year.  We were sending the smear tests to small laboratories, where we were getting poor quality assurance, QA and we had no QA to tell us what the performance was.  Some of the women being screened were being screened far too frequently and others were not being screened at all.  We were having no impact on mortality.  I can remember testimony by clinicians, particularly from those who came back to work in this country around that time about the late stage of presentation of young women with young children with cervical cancer.  That situation has not changed completely, but it is changing substantially.  We have had since 2010 a substantial reduction in the mortality associated with the programme and a range of other factors that allow us to say that people are being identified.  <br\/><br\/>We heard earlier about the 50,000 or so women who have been identified with early stage changes that could be dealt with definitively.  If we continue with the performance parameters that we are seeing with our programme, we can be confident that we will continue to drive down that mortality.  When we supplement that with what we are doing in terms of HPV screening, which will start later year, we can be confident in the screening performance of that.  We have substantial reason to continue to express high confidence as leaders in the health care system.  All of our health care practitioners should be in a position to continue on the basis of the data that we have available to us.  I can make available to the committee an article that was published in the <i>European Journal of Cancer Care<\/i>about three years ago, based on a side by side comparison, questionnaire based.  This analysis of cervical cancer screening programmes around Europe confirmed that we have one of the most organised, highest performing and most quality assured programmes anywhere in Europe.  Many of the features we are talking about here today are exhibited by very few organised programmes.

Was legal advice sought by either the HSE or CervicalCheck, on that?<\/p> <p>  The second question I have relates to when the first legal letter came in on this matter and who it came to.  There would have been an exchange of legal correspondence before proceedings started.  Who did it come in to and why did that not set off alarm bells at that stage about notifying the other people who were involved?  Why has it been the case that we have had to wait for it to go all of the way to court before we have now decided to notify all of the other people involved?  Can these matters be clarified?

There is going to be huge increase in the number of people looking for repeat smears.  What system has been set up to deal with the increased volume of repeat smears that are going to be taken and analysed?  Has any process been looked at at this stage in relation to that area as regards ensuring that, if there is an increase in volume, that they can be dealt with in an expeditious manner?<\/p> <p>  Finally, my understanding is that there are 15 clinics.  Some of those clinics had raised concerns with the people directly at the top of the organisation over the last number of years.  Can it be clarified whether there were regular meetings with the principal people involved in these 15 clinics, or was it all by email and by telephone?  I have received information to the effect that some people in the clinics based around the country had expressed concerns about issues as they arose but found that their concerns were not being taken on board.  Was there a mechanism where regular meetings occurred on an overall basis between the 15 clinics and the people who were in charge of the entire programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#UU02100","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":809,"content":"<p>First, I will deal with the questions in sequence, I will then hand over to Mr. Gleeson for certain points.<\/p> <p>  The first point about disclosure which is critical and central here, a decision not to share is the reverse of my reading of the process in this situation.  There was a clinical audit ongoing.  There was a very protracted discussion both nationally and internationally about models of disclosure, concerning how and when to disclose.  That is where the debate was; it was not designed not to disclose.<\/p> <p>  What has evolved, apart from the reference earlier to the information being sent to the clinicians, was a patient information leaflet for patients telling them, where appropriate, that a review had taken place, and a very simple mechanism to trigger an appointment with a clinician to discuss all elements of the review.  <\/p> <p>  The second point I will leave to Mr. Gleeson, regarding the current case and when correspondence started.<\/p><p> The third point is that we anticipate an increased volume of smears, but it is very hard to quantify.  Our actions this morning were to make sure there was the capacity, where clinically appropriate, to enable women to have smears without delay.  That is open-ended.  We do not know how long the interest and anxiety will last for, but we are prepared to keep the enhanced resourcing until everybody has had their questions answered to their satisfaction and, where appropriate, additional smears will be taken.

As Dr. McKenna has outlined, even <i>in extremis<\/i>based on the estimates we have heard and even if all of the cases were missed opportunities for diagnosis, they fall, in total, within the parameters of a successful screening programme because screening programmes are not 100% effective.  The benefit of this screening programme is that 50,000 women have had a diagnosis of high-grade cell changes resulting in early treatment, resulting in their being able to avoid developing cancer.  Consequently, the numbers of cancers have fallen and the number of deaths has fallen.  These are really important health benefits in respect of which we must collectively try to do our best not to lose because it would be to the detriment of everyone if the trend went backwards.  In addition to putting matters to right for the women who were not given the information they should have been given, one of our greatest focuses and one that has been our immediate priority is restoring public confidence.  Without it, we will pay a huge public health price.

That is because this form of testing is internationally understood to be 70% accurate.  It is a screening test and not a diagnostic test.  It was always inevitable that the screening programme, as with all population screening programmes, would not provide a pathway to diagnosis for every woman who might have been able to benefit from it.  At the outset, based on all the public health information available, and in any country that has decided to have a screening programme for any population-based cancer, the decision is made to have the screening programme based on the benefit it can deliver as opposed to the benefits it will not deliver.  That benefit, as I characterised earlier, is a 7% reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  The detection of high-grade cervical cell abnormalities among 50,000 patients, enabling them to have treatment, means they will not go on to develop cervical cancer.

We did not want to have very small providers doing things such as were happening in Ireland at the time.  The Deputy used the interesting phrase \"reading the slides close to the hospital\".  In some cases, that meant on the kitchen table at home.  Ten years ago, Deputy Coppinger's constituents might have waited up to a year for their results.  The ten-day turnaround is because that is what is required to be able to offer a credible cervical screening programme - or any screening programme.  We can not say come have a test and wait forever for the result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#YY00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Some women waited seven years for the results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#YY00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":864,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

Dr. Gibbons and other scientists subsequently resigned because their concerns were ignored and dismissed.  When that was put to Mr. O'Brien, he said that he had addressed those concerns in the final contract before it was awarded to Quest Diagnostics.  Will the witness describe how he addressed those concerns?  What was written into the contract?  If Mr. O'Brien was prepared to address those concerns, why was that not indicated to the scientists at the time, instead of forcing their resignation?<\/p> <p>  He subsequently said he was happy with the standards applied by Quest Diagnostics.  Mr. O'Brien must have been happy with the standards applied by CPL in Austin, Texas, as well, because he awarded it the contract.  However, CPL is the company that was successfully sued by Ms Vicky Phelan.  It settled with her for &euro;2.5 million.  Why would the company have settled with her if there was not a difficulty?  I would like a brief answer. <\/p> <p>  I have read the press release from the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine on cervical screening.  It has called on the Minister for Health to publish the results of the 2014 audit.  When I asked the Minister in the D&aacute;il last night to do that, he said there were no results of the audit - there were just individual reports for individual women.  I spoke to a friend of mine who is a scientist about this today.  She said that would be extraordinary because every audit has to have at least an introduction, the basis on which the audit was carried out, why it was carried out, what triggered it and what the terms of reference were.  That is the very least.  An audit will not just have Margaret's results, Ruth's results and Br&iacute;d's results and a description of how they have been looked at.  There has to be a description and a report back.  We are looking for that to be published.  I echo the call by the academy for the 2014 audit to be published.  I would like Mr. O'Brien to comment.  <\/p> <p>  When the State Claims Agency, and I think it was Mr. Gleeson, was alerted that there was a claim made by Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. O'Brien said he did not know anything about it until last Friday.  I do not believe him.  I do not believe that the Minister did not know.  Other people might believe Mr. O'Brien but I doubt it.  I think there are thousands of people out there who do not believe Mr. O'Brien.  There may not be a paper trail or a smoking gun, an email or anything else but there could have been a conversation.  Did Mr. Gleeson keep this to himself as a secret or did he discuss it verbally with anybody else?  Would Mr. Gleeson get information like that, in a position of responsibility, and keep it all to himself?  If Mr. O'Brien, as the head of the HSE, did not know until last Friday, he must be hopping mad.  He must be looking for heads to roll over this.  If he is not, I wonder why.  I think anybody else would.  I have one more quick question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#YY01000","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":871,"content":"<p>The Deputy is eating into the time for the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#YY01100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":872,"content":"<p>I know.

There are many different statistics that appear to be in conflict with each other but they are not.  When we talk about sensitivity and specificity of a test, it means a different thing when we talk about false positive and false negative.  They are technically different things.  It is a different thing again in terms of a yield and how likely it is, and how positive one can be that the result that is negative is in fact negative.  They are different measures and they are being used interchangeably.<\/p> <p>  It is important we are given time to be able to set this out for the committee in a way it can understand.  I am not suggesting Deputy O'Reilly is doing this, but the way in which various statistics are being used is creating an impression that there is a conflict that is not in fact there.  If I can give an example, and I am not going to quote in terms of the screening programme and its figures because we can calculate those figures off the performance of our own programme, but if we are talking about something that is 80% sensitive this means there is an 80% chance that if a disease is there a test will find it, and there is a 20% chance that if the disease is there it will not find it.  This is what the 80% means.<\/p> <p>  Whether or not we can rely on the test being negative when we get a negative result depends not only on the sensitivity but also on the incidence of the disease in the background population.  I appreciate this is a technical epidemiological point I am making.  If a disease has a frequency of 1% and a test is applied that has a sensitivity of 80%, there is a different likelihood of it being positive or negative than if the disease had a frequency of one in 10,000.  All of these factors bear.<\/p> <p>  The statements that are being made about the performance of the test, and its sensitivity and specificity being low, at in and around 70% in relation to sensitivity, is correct.  It is broadly in line with the performance of the test in international hands.  Statements have been made about negative predictive value, in other words, if I get a negative test how likely is it that the disease is not present.  This is a very small figure.  It is a percentage figure that probably for the performance or test might even be much lower than the figure that has been given, and I am not in any sense disputing the figure my clinical colleague has given.  He may be referring to a different patient population where a higher incidence of the disease might exist.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we do not get confused and create a sense in which figures that are really important in terms of people's ability to be able to rely on the test and rely on the information they are getting in terms of predictive value, in some way appear on the part of the programme to be confused.  I take the point that in general terms the programme should, on a continuing basis like any source of information, continue to improve its communication.  This is not in any sense to say that erroneous information is being transmitted to patients.  It is really important that we get this point across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#AAA02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":997,"content":"<p>Dr. McKenna said he would change the leaflet.

It states: \"What has happened is totally inappropriate.\"  That is referring to withholding of information from women.  What I want to know is, given that Dr. Henry, who is here, and Dr. McKenna who is also here, were aware that there were serious concerns, was any of this kicked up the line, and at what point?  Mr. Gleeson has already indicated that stuff got kicked up the line.  I am not quite sure what that means.  We might get a chance to go back to that.  Was any of this kicked up the line?  I find it absolutely extraordinary that Mr. O'Brien would not have been informed of a senior clinician who had serious issues with regard to the conduct of sharing information with women about themselves, which is material.

I thank Mr. O'Brien.  I would like to read out what the HSE defines as open disclosure, which is at the heart of all of this.<\/p><blockquote>An open, consistent approach to communicating with service users when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the service user informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event.<\/blockquote> <p>So, the question at hand is whether Vicky Phelan was afforded open disclosure, and whether many other women, and possibly men, within the national screening service have been afforded open disclosure, and indeed there is a wider question now across the HSE, due to this.  From what I have seen in the past week, there is a conspiracy of silence within the healthcare system when it came to Vicky Phelan's case and when it came to several hundred other women who were not informed of false negatives.  Senior people within the national screening service knew the details of Vicky Phelan's case and they knew that hundreds of other women had not been communicated with.  Senior management within the HSE knew those things as well, and the doctors knew those things - maybe not in the hundreds but they knew that their own patients had not been communicated with.  People at the very highest levels within the HSE, at the level of direct reporting to Mr. O'Brien, at a senior level within the national screening service and senior consultants, all knew for years that the false negatives had occurred and as of today all of the women still have not been told.<\/p><p>I will start with Dr. Henry.  We know that he was made aware of this issue, not just Vicky Phelan's case, but the wider issue of women not being afforded open disclosure, why did he not inform Mr. O'Brien as the head of the HSE, and why did he not act to begin to put in place the measures which are now being put in place, in an emergency response - because this has gone public?

The reply I received from the cervical screening programme was that it was the responsibility of the caring clinicians to provide this information.

It stated that on further reviewing the letter CervicalCheck sent down to Dr. Hickey with respect to an audit of the cervical smears on cancer patients, CervicalCheck highlighted just three it felt should be considered for recall on discussion.  Dr. Hickey wrote there were a number of others that looked as though there were significant discrepancies, and he was somewhat uncomfortable about just recalling the three that CervicalCheck had highlighted.  Dr. Hickey had ten patients.  This was active correspondence from a consultant saying this matter was affecting ten of his patients.  Doctors have been told to use their discretion, but clearly Dr. Hickey was being told by CervicalCheck that only three of the ten needed to be told.

I have a question for Mr. O'Brien.  How can Irish clinicians conduct multi-disciplinary teamwork with people in different time zones, who use different nomenclature and perhaps different terminology regarding cervical cytology?  That is the first question.  Second, from the time the cervical screening programme was introduced, and we did not have the capacity in Ireland because there was a backlog, was any attempt made by the HSE to increase the capacity in the Irish system?  When the backlog was dealt with abroad, was the HSE working to ramp up capacity in the Irish system, based on the concerns of clinicians in Ireland in 2008?  Doing the job in the United States was a third of the price of what it was here.  Did that ring any alarm bells when it came to quality analysis?  I have come upon the McGoogan report from 2004, which laid out what we should be doing before we had the screening programme.  Here is recommendation 1.7 on how it should be conducted:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;A management structure with clear governance arrangements is required to ensure that the legal obligations to eligible women, health care professionals and staff participating in the Programme including Phase One are met.&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>Another recommendation: &quot;The establishment of effective governance arrangements with immediate effect is necessary in order to provide overall leadership and direction in terms of policy development&quot;, and so on.Recommendation 1.12: &quot;A quality assurance (QA) programme should continue to be given priority in the ICSP.&quot;  The report further recommends that:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;Structures must be put in place to allow review or revision of quality standards by a National ICSP Quality Assurance Committee which should include representation from the Professional bodies, other key stakeholders such as the Cancer Registry, the Cancer Society and other cancer screening programmes&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>It seems that much of what was recommended did not actually happen.  Then I found the women's charter.  This is addressed to the women: &quot;All members of CervicalCheck staff will respect your privacy, dignity, religion, race and cultural beliefs.&quot;  It makes a commitment that women would always have the opportunity to make their views known and to have them taken into account.  Women are assured that their smear tests will be screened in an accredited quality-assured lab.  CervicalCheck also committed that a woman's result and any treatment recommendations would be provided to her and her nominated smear taker by the programme within four weeks.  In regard to that last point of the women's charter, I do not think Vicky Phelan got what it said on the tin.

Rather, I was invited to take up the role on the basis of a set of Government policies which were about the abolition of the HSE and the introduction of universal health insurance.  So I did the job in a particular way, in the context of that, for close to three years, expecting to be winding down the organisation and moving it into a collection of different types of service providers, hospital groups on a statutory basis and community health organisations.  As the Deputy knows, that did not happen.  I had discussions with the relevant Ministers.  What we have actually been doing is seeking to prepare the HSE for the type of future envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report as a result of which Government sanctioned: the appointment of a chief operations officer so that there is very clear accountability for the operating system; the appointment of a strategy and planning head in order that we have much more focus on planning to population need, as they do in other countries; and, just recently, for the first time ever in the Irish healthcare system, the appointment of a chief clinical officer.  So what I have been attempting to do in the second three years, and it has been extraordinarily slow because of the approvals processes one must go through, is come to a much more streamlined system of governance.  That is the only reason people have moved around in this context.  In an organisation the size of the HSE, people move around.  They have opportunities to apply for different jobs, posts become vacant and other people come in.  Yes, it is complicated.  An organisation the scale of the HSE is inherently complex.  I have long maintained that the structures of the HSE are in fact not fit for purpose.  I have been saying that throughout my time.  I have now got to a point where I think, subject to the implementation plan for Sl&aacute;intecare, that there is a much coherent organisation of functions at the top level which is useful and valid.  It is extraordinary that, for the very first time, the Irish health system has a chief clinical officer - appointed within the past four or five weeks.

We are going over a period where no decision was made.  Did that not concern Dr. Henry?  He was the clinical officer.  Will this be the process in the future regarding any decisions that are to be made?  Will it go around the house and back again to the same place where it was two years previously?  Did that occur to Dr. Henry at the time?  I know he was not clinical director but surely it must have occurred to him that this delay was not acceptable.<\/p><p>My second question concerns the role of clinical director.  The clinical director was <i>in situ<\/i>for quite a period.  I know we are going back to 2008 when this process was set up.  The masters of the Coombe, Holles Street and the Rotunda have seven-year contracts.  In fairness, any of these roles are extremely demanding.  The person is dealing with a huge number of people and a number of different units throughout the country.  Likewise, a master of one of the maternity hospitals faces a huge number of demands.  Does Dr. McKenna not think the way forward might be to stipulate a defined period for the director's job?  The director can reapply when the job comes up for review but that process would be there.  I am just looking at the way forward.<\/p><p>What kind of timescale would be involved if we decided tomorrow morning that we wanted all smear tests to be dealt with here?  I know the Coombe is carrying out some analysis in this area in the sense that it is providing a service.  My understanding is that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland had a laboratory but that this service has now gone out to private enterprise.  I stand open to correction on that.  The process is being provided in Ireland.  How long would it take to put in place the requisite number of people with the skills necessary to deal with all of the smear tests that are done here?  Would it take two, three or four years?  What kind of period would it take us to build up those skills?  It is important to look at that.  Given that we have been sending tests out and using US companies for over ten years, surely we should be looking at trying to keep all of this work within the Irish jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#EEE00500","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>As I outlined before, I first became aware of this on 11 July 2017.

To be honest, that information should be at the top as the witnesses knew this issue had emerged in the press.  The witness made some disparaging remarks about tests being done on the kitchen table.  That is at odds with what Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith said.  He is not an insignificant person as a former master of the Rotunda Hospital and he called the service it ran accredited and world class.<\/p> <p>  One cannot dismiss the fact that this was predicted by people ten years ago.  In addition, they said it would be ten years before these problems would emerge.  Some &euro;20 per test multiplied by 3 million, which is &euro;60 million, was paid to a private company which makes massive profits and has connections with Goldman Sachs.  These people are in it for a reason, and it is not for patients.  That was not purely the HSE's decision.  The witness is correct that the D&aacute;il voted for that, despite counter arguments at the time.  The majority of parties, even if they ranted about it at the time, did not challenge it when they came into power.  It is the issue of public services being starved of resources and then being privatised.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the rate of testing.  My understanding, and I am open to correction, is that the NHS guidelines are that 50 tests per day is the recommended best practice level.  Quest Diagnostics was doing 90 to 100.  I tried to calculate the figures by dividing 25,000 by 365, but presumably laboratories do not operate for 365 days a year.  They might take weekends off, but I do not know.  However, the rate in Quest Diagnostics must have been nearly twice what the NHS recommends.<\/p> <p>  A screener is only supposed to carry out a maximum of 5,000 per year.  If there is pressure to make profit by getting as many tests carried out as possible these things are absolutely inevitable.  Corners were cut in women's health at a time when the economy was going into recession.  Again, political parties took that decision.

What I am trying to address here is a sense that we have evidence of a substantial failure of the cytology service that people here depend on for the reliability of the tests.  We have to try to reassure people about that because they are genuinely worried and concerned.<\/p> <p>  We carry out approximately 250,000 smears per year.  The abnormal rate that is reported, between high grades and low grades, is approximately 8,000.  I will call that 10,000 for the purpose of simplicity.  That is 240,000 negative test results per year.  We know we have approximately 300 incident cases of cervical cancer in this country per year.<\/p><p>We believe the test performs at the rate of about 70% sensitivity.  That means it misses about 30% of cancers that are present at the time of testing.  For simplicity, we will say that works out to be somewhere in the region of 100 false negatives.  That gives a false negative rate of substantially less than 1%, therefore, when the accuracy figure of 99% set out in the figures is quoted, it is based on statistics like that.  That is a back of the envelope calculation.  What I am trying to illustrate is that the general assertion - I do not suggest Deputy Coppinger is making this particular assertion - is that there is some evidence here of a substantial failure in the cytology service being used to give people reassurance.  We simply do not have evidence of that.  There have been substantial failures.  There has been clear admission in regard to them, particularly in terms of unacceptable failures of communication to patients, but that cannot be equated with a statement or review.  I have to make that point about the cytology service and the evidence we have in terms of performance.  The point has been made by the director general that the differential performance, about which again there is a legitimate question, can be provided by way of response to the committee.  That may well help to satisfy some of the questions that have been asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#GGG01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1200,"content":"<p>I am going to extend Dr. Holohan's time.  I have a question on that.  In a case of a false negative, and the frequency of testing is every three years, the rate of growth of cervical cancer is slow.  If someone has a false negative and she comes back in three years' time, is there an estimation of how advanced that cancer would have progressed in those three years?  The benefit of screening is that women are screened every three years in order that a profile of the patient is being built up.  If there is a false negative on one smear, how much of a change would be expected in a three-year period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#HHH00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>I could hazard offering an answer on that.  Once a woman has a visible, invasive cervical cancer, she will probably live without treatment for about 18 to 24 months.  However, we know, and this is one of the best studied areas of screening in any part of the body, that to get to that stage there is a pre-invasive stage that may take as long as 12 or 15 years, which starts off as a mild abnormality and usually progresses at a reasonable rate to a severe abnormality and then to cancer.  At any of those stages it can revert back to being normal, but the nearer one gets to having an invasive cervical cancer, the more likely it is to progress into being an invasive cancer.  The premise of the Chairman's question is whether one has several opportunities to catch it before it becomes invasive.  The answer is one has many opportunities.  This test, which has a high false negative rate, works because one has several attempts at it over the ten or 12-year period before it turns into an invasive cancer.  If it progressed more rapidly and the test was as good as it is now, it would not work but because it progresses so slowly, this test, which has error built into it, works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#HHH00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter McKenna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":1202,"content":"<p>To go back to the Deputy's question about the prediction Dr. David Gibbons made, I heard him saying that what is happening now is what he predicted.

The chief medical officer has just taken us through an explanation of why that is not what we are experiencing.  Dr. Gibbons did not predict that there would be a review process that would go so terribly wrong in terms of its communication to patients.  That review process going terribly wrong has got nothing to do with where the slides were read.  Such a review process would have had to occur wherever those slides were processed, including here, and there were such misses when the programme was based in Ireland in terms of its cytology process.  If the same flawed process of communication had occurred, we would still be here having this discussion because it is fundamentally not about an excessive level of miss, taking into account the limitations of this test.  Clearly, any miss is highly regrettable.  While we have this programme, the whole purpose is to prevent cervical cancer.  We do not take some satisfaction from the fact that the miss rate here is simply that which would normally be expected.  We would wish we had a better test, and we will move to a better test, but what Dr. Gibbons predicted is not what we are experiencing.

There will be an investigation into those facts and how they might have played out in these cases that might help to elucidate the specifics.  That goes to the heart of the question he asked earlier about the advice I gave the previous Minister for Health and now Taoiseach and gave to the current Minister which seems to be counterintuitive.  The reality is that it is complex.  In the minds of many medical practitioners, what plays into their decisions are fears over creating medical legal risk for themselves.  This may not be the reality in terms of genuine risk, but there is a perception there.  All too often when harm occurs, instead of embracing the opportunity to sit with patients and explain, sometimes the temptation on the part of practitioners is to circle the wagons, close ranks and not share information.  I could give a long list of cases where that has been at the very heart of those practices.<\/p> <p>  Without going into detail, the purpose ultimately of what is in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act is to essentially offer protections to doctors and standards on open disclosure, effectively saying that if they do it in the right way, these protections will be offered to them.  That allows us to give them reassurance and say that it is a safe and worthwhile thing to do and to encourage it.

I would like to give a little more detail of what the Taoiseach was talking about this morning, although in the circumstances, I do not want to spend a long time in describing it.  If we call the total 3,000 people for the purposes of discussion, whether they are part of the original 1,482 or the cohort that has to be identified, each case is to be looked at through an international process we are to establish.  We have taken steps to begin to mobilise some of that expertise.  It will require us to gain access to some of the slide materials from some of the laboratories.  It will require us to do the data matching that was described.  Any discordance, in the 208 cases we know about or any other one we might identify, will be subject to a full clinical review which will involve assessment by an international panel of experts capable of making it.  It will include a review of charts and a meeting with each of the individual patients.  Each individual woman who finds herself in this situation will have the question addressed as to the likelihood it has had an impact on either her treatment at the time of diagnosis or the eventual outcome.  In very tragic cases where people are no longer alive, for the next of kin who will such information, it will help to address some of the questions for them.<\/p> <p>  We also see some of the information in the findings of that process which will bring it to one report which will be published being made available to feed into ongoing consideration of the redress process that the Taoiseach this morning indicated that he was open to considering and to which the Government will give consideration.  We are also giving further consideration - I know that the Minister has taken steps today to engage with other parties to - to the question as to what will be the most effective investigative vehicle to bring closure to some of the items of information, in particular some of the additional items that came into the public domain last evening.  With the Minister amd as the director general said, we will receive receive daily reports from the head of the serious incident management team, SIMT, and Mr. Damien McCallion who will have operational responsibility.

Section 51 takes that slightly further, saying that so long as the processing is necessary and proportionate and also subject to suitable and specific measures, special categories of personal data, which we are going to be discussing a lot, about ethnic origin, political opinions, health, sexual orientation and so on, can be processed for research, historical and archiving purposes.  What these sections mean at the most basic level is that using someone's data without his or her consent for research or scientific purposes is allowed.  Section 58 then restricts the type of research or archiving processes.  Some of the rights that people have in regard to their own data under the GDPR, for example, may be the right to have inaccurate data about them corrected, the right to object to processing and so on.  In general, all that is fine because there are strong public interest reasons for doing research and archiving.  Certainly in the case of archiving, it may literally be impossible to get consent because the data involved may belong to somebody whose whereabouts are not known.<\/p><p>However, there is a slight concern that &quot;scientific research purposes&quot; are not defined in the Bill.  In other countries, Germany for example, there is a tradition of requiring research to be completely independent of any corporate influence in order to be considered scientific.  Independence is generally understood as the research staff having full autonomy in determining both the object of the study and the methods of inquiry.  In Germany, therefore, corporate research and analytics are unlikely to constitute &quot;scientific research&quot; within the meaning of the GDPR.<\/p><p>Our concern is that, particularly in the context of very sophisticated multinationals operating in Ireland, while we do not have this traditional understanding of scientific research, we do have a traditional deference to multinationals.  This could give rise to a broad interpretation of what &quot;scientific research&quot; constitutes.  Particularly because we are talking about the most protected types of personal data, we have to make sure this does not happen.  <\/p><p>We think this is a small amendment.  We want to make sure the data being exempted in these circumstances are being used for truly scientific purposes, in order to serve the public interest and make the world a better place.

We feel that introducing these protective measures is common sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#C04100","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1475,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 5, with consequential amendments Nos. 74 - which is not in this group for some reason - 96 and 111, to sections 48, 57 and 70 are absolutely crucial in our opinion.  In discussing them, I will touch on some of the more controversial issues in this area.  While my introductory remarks might be somewhat lengthy, that will not be repeated across the afternoon.  I want to raise some general points now, which will save me from making them later, because they are key.<\/p> <p>  In all the debate around the Bill, the power of the Minister to make regulations after the fact, with no Oireachtas oversight, governing the processing of personal data or special categories of data, and restricting people's data rights has probably generated the most controversy, and is much more important than the age of consent in its implications.  <\/p> <p>  At present, section 48 allows a Minister, or effectively a Department, to do the following: to designate some purpose - essentially anything - as being in the substantial public interest and make regulations allowing someone - presumably anyone - to take information about people's sexual orientation, sex life, political opinions, trade union membership and so on, as well as their genetic and biometric data and to do who knows what with it for the purpose of fulfilling some substantial public interest that we do not yet know about.<\/p><p>Section 57 proposes that the basic rights in the GDPR contained between Articles 12 to 22, and Article 34 can all be restricted for the purposes of what is called the general public interest.  Section 57 contains a list of things relating to what the general public interest might be but it is not exhaustive and any Minister can designate by regulation basically anything as being in the public interest.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to section 70 and the reason we tabled those amendments, let us look at section 48 as an example.  This section allows for the processing of special categories of data such as health, sexual orientation and so on by whichever entity the Minister decides on for reasons of public interest so it could be, for example, that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection decides it is going to create a database of people's ethnicity in order to combat fraud.  It comes up with some sort of internal policy paper that links ethnicity and social welfare fraud and relates higher levels of fraud among some ethnic groups.  The Minister then designates the prevention of social welfare fraud as being a substantial public interest and the Department comes up with regulations, gives a nod to the section, the Minister signs off and lo and behold, we have racial profiling and it is legal.  A database is created about the riskiest ethnic groups who are targeted for invasive procedures.  It might sound dramatic but that would be lawful at the moment.  <br\/><br\/>I know the Minister will tell me that the provisions in subsection 5 would protect against this but there is a problem with that.  The problem is the Irish State's record of data protection.  We know it from the public services card and the primary online database.  We know it not just from international problems but internationally.  We must put this discussion in context.  We do not have a good reputation for data protection.  In 2015, the former German federal commissioner for data protection put it bluntly when he told <i>The New York Times<\/i>why Internet businesses go to Ireland.  He said:<\/p><blockquote>Of course Facebook would go to a country with the lowest levels of data protection.  It's natural they would choose Ireland.<\/blockquote><p>We have also seen how our data retention regime has been the subject of significant legal issues going back more than ten years with Digital Rights Ireland cases; the constitutional challenge; having our data retention laws struck down in national constitutional courts in Germany, Bulgaria and Romania; the Tele2 case; and the Murray judgment.  We must look at our record in this issue because the State continues to fight on it.  Not only that, when we were presented with the Communications (Retention of Data) Bill as late as last year, it fell short of the Murray recommendations and the requirements in European law in the form of Tele2 and the European Convention on Human Rights so that is the context in which we must look at this Bill.<br\/><br\/>Our proven approach to this issue involves trundling along until we are forced by the European Court of Justice to derogate from that.  Our proposal simply says that against this backdrop, and this is what all these amendments are about and we really see them as one of the most important bits, it is necessary that the Oireachtas has some kind of rules around the processing of the most sensitive types of data because that is what we are talking about.  We need to have some democratic oversight and not a Civil Service free for all.  Therefore, our very reasonable proposal is that when a Minister wants to make regulations under section 48 allowing the processing of the most sensitive kinds of data, they must ask the House to approve it.  I do not think that is dramatic.<br\/><br\/>Our proposal in respect of section 70 is similar.  That deals with the processing of sensitive data by competent authorities and other bodies specified in law for criminal justice purposes.  The last section where we think this positive resolution procedure should apply is section 57.  I mentioned earlier that section 57 allows for the restriction of rights under Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34 for what is called the general public interest.  It lists 14 indicative objections of the general public interest.  These are investigating ethics breaches in regulated professions, identifying assets derived from crime, ensuring the effective operation of immigration and so on.  Look at the 14 objectives and in two seconds, one will be able to name the lobby group in each case which argued for the inclusion of its own objective in terms of this section.  In the case of each of the 14, the Minister is allowed under the section to make regulations restricting rights under Articles 12 to 22 and Article 34.  Under this section, any Minister is also allowed to designate new objectives as being of general public interest.  All of this restricting and designating will take place behind closed doors with no democratic oversight or accountability.  This section essentially means that Government Departments will be the judges of what rights individuals should have against them and their agencies without any need for legislation.  These are rights people have by right under European law and the GDPR.  <br\/><br\/>When we were here during pre-legislative scrutiny, the chair of Digital Rights Ireland, Dr T.J. McIntyre, put forward the idea of a positive resolution being necessary before any regulations are passed in the more controversial sections as one of the ways to mitigate against many of the wrongs in this Bill.  This is exactly what we are doing with this group of amendments.  At a previous meeting of the committee, Simon McGarr said, &quot;I do not think we should allow for an unqualified right of a Minister to provide for exemptions from European law at the stroke of a pen by way of a statutory instrument regardless of whether that is attractive to the Executive as a method of providing for regulatory activity.&quot;  Contrary to how much of the media focus has been around this Bill, this is actually one of the key provisions in it and we take it very seriously, which is why I took the extra time in making my introductory remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#C04200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1477,"content":"<p>We will be supporting the amendment in the name of Deputies Daly and Wallace.  Like Deputy Daly, I will make some points to which I will refer after the fact rather than repeat in respect of various amendments because they apply to a number of them.<\/p> <p>  One of the primary criticisms of this Bill is the length of it and the extent of the exemptions and the scope for regulation.  In a general sense, the principles of the GDPR are quite strong and represent progress in terms of data protection in Europe, although I am sure the general public is sick and tired of the GDPR, emails and so on.<\/p> <p>  This legislation has been the subject of significant criticism for a number of reasons.  At the outset, the Minister said that the GDPR generally has direct effect and that it would create problems where the Irish legislation will come into conflict with it.  I would say that the legislation as currently drafted and very likely some of the Minister's amendments are in conflict with the GDPR and there will be contradictions at the behest of the Government between the GDPR and the Data Protection Bill.  This will result in litigation, which is very problematic in itself because it will create a lack of certainty regarding data protection.<\/p> <p>  However, I would also be very concerned about the very substantial and wide discretion the Minister is being allowed in the creation of regulations.  That is the reason we put forward and had amendments passed in the Seanad about seeking impact assessments of the proposed processing of special categories of personal data.  I recognise that some progress was made regarding the qualification that it be necessary and proportionate as opposed to simply being necessary, which was the previous provision.  That is a step forward but the potential categories of exemptions are still very wide and allow the Minister too much discretion.<\/p> <p>  I made the point on Second Stage that the Bill uses the term \"public interest\" in excess of 20 times but there is no definition of public interest.  There is a definition in the GDPR.  Article 9.2(g) states that the public interest should \"respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.\"  The fact that this area is not defined in this Bill is a problem, particularly where the public interest is referred to so many times as the basis for exceptions and scope for regulation.<\/p><p> In a general sense I have a problem with the Bill's approach that something \"shall be lawful, except where...\", whereas in the GDPR the approach is that something \"shall not be lawful, except where...\"  The presumption is in the opposite direction.  I have concerns about numerous sections.  I am likely to oppose sections 37, 45 and 57 on these and other bases.<\/p><p> I will try not to repeat those points.  I thought it would be useful at the outset to outline the basis for that.  Safeguards, such as the proposed positive resolution by the Houses of the Oireachtas, are important to safeguard people's data protection rights, and to reduce the impact of the numerous exceptions and substantial discretion the legislation gives the Minister. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#D00200","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1479,"content":"<p>It seems clear that the Deputies are trying to draw a distinction between regulations made under sections 48, 57 and 70, and those made under other sections of the Bill.  In the case of regulations made under sections 48, 57 and 70, it is proposed that draft regulations be laid before the Houses and would not take effect until they had the approval of both Houses.  Deputy Clare Daly described it as a bit dramatic.  I do not believe that such a heavy approval procedure for regulations is justified.  We see here a proposal to depart from the accepted practice and procedure for the purposes of drafting regulations in accordance with our legislative programme.  I do not believe it is either necessary or proportionate to depart from accepted procedure.<\/p> <p>  In all cases, as is made clear by the relevant sections, the regulations will permit data processing only insofar as necessary and proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved.  I draw members' attention to the threshold we have set out clearly in sections 48(6), 57(10) and 70.  Any processing must be necessary for reasons of substantial interest.<\/p> <p>  It might be useful to look at some of the examples under the 1988 Act, which have been introduced over the years.  I refer particularly to SI 426\/2016, which was made to permit the processing of sensitive personal data by the Garda Commissioner for the purposes of assisting the Northern Ireland historical institutional abuse inquiry.  Shortly thereafter SI 427\/2016 was made to permit the processing of sensitive personal data by the Garda Commissioner for the purposes of the coroner's inquest in Northern Ireland into the death of Arlene Arkinson.  Earlier SI 240\/2015 was made to permit the processing of sensitive personal data by the Garda Commissioner in order to provide assistance to the coroner's inquest in Northern Ireland into the death of ten people at Kingsmill in County Armagh.  SI 486\/2011 was made to enable sensitive personal data to be disclosed and processed by the committee chaired by former Senator Martin McAleese to establish the facts of the State involvement in the Magdalen laundries.<\/p> <p>  Any regulations made under section 48 must be lawful, necessary and proportionate.  Adherence with these thresholds will be overseen by the Office of the Attorney General when providing legal advice, as that office does to all Departments on the matter of the drafting of the content of regulations.  In all cases the Departments concerned will be required to consult with my office and also with the data protection commission.<\/p> <p>  I believe we have sufficient safeguards.

We need to consider the time implication of an oversight role for committees or the D&aacute;il, which might be onerous.  One answer to that might be to consider setting up an Oireachtas data protection committee to scrutinise regulations made under this Act.  The UK has a digital affairs committee and Germany has a similar one.

We refer to it as being secondary legislation, but in effect any Minister when signing a statutory instrument is changing the law.  It is common in every Act that a Minister may make regulations pursuant to the purposes of the Act.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Daly's amendment is not enormously controversial.  The first part proposes that the system which operates consistently under our laws that when a regulation is introduced by a Minister by way of statutory instrument, the Oireachtas can by vote reverse that regulation if it does so by resolution within 21 days.  That feature is contained in so much legislation because it gives a legislative basis and a justification to what the Minister is doing.  I am sure if it was challenged in the courts that a Minister is making law and is not entitled to make law when, in fact, the Oireachtas is the body that makes law, the argument would be made that there is an ability within the legislation for the Oireachtas to set aside that law.  There is nothing unusual about that.  The first three parts of Deputy Daly's amendment are consistent with what operates in other legislation.<\/p> <p>  It differs in identifying in respect of sections 48, 57 and 70 a slightly different method of Oireachtas approval of any statutory instrument.<\/p><p>Oireachtas approval requires that a draft of the regulation must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and a resolution approving it must be passed by the House.  Instead of retrospective disapproval, it is prospective approval.  No matter what it is, the Oireachtas must have a role in any statutory instrument that a Minister issues.  The Oireachtas must have an ability to set it aside.  I see no difference in the Oireachtas having an ability to approve it in advance.  I listened to the contribution from the Minister.  The Minister's contention is that he is not convinced that this onerous obligation that would be placed to the Oireachtas is necessary or proportionate, that it is not justified.  I do not look at it that way.  The Oireachtas is the law-making body within the State.  The Oireachtas stands in a position of supervision over statutory instruments that are issued by a Minister.  There can be situations where there is retrospective disapproval, as exists already.  Why not put in a system of prospective approval?  I think we need to recognise something.  I am not aware of any time in the history of the State when a statutory instrument was reversed by resolution of the Oireachtas, so maybe we should be looking at a more prospective method of approval of statutory instruments.

The ability to use statutory instruments in the manner in which they have been used right across the board will actually be replaced.  We must think about the reality of what happens, which is that committee time must be found, processes must be in place and time within the Oireachtas must be found.  We are taking out a process that was designed to enable a sometimes quite speedy reaction.  We are replacing that with what will effectively be a legislative process through the Oireachtas.

I think it would be reasonable that many regulations the Minister would seek to make under this legislation would be put to the House without debate, but there are very many exceptions.  I refer to situations where the implications for the public could be very considerable and would justify debate.  To a lot of people this may seem dry and in many situations it is, but it has very serious potential implications.  It has been well outlined.  Relevant information may include people's political opinions, their sexual orientation, their background, their history, all that kind of stuff.

I merely want to assure the committee that the process is there.  Irrespective of whether at some future time the Houses of the Oireachtas decide to introduce new committees is entirely a matter for the Oireachtas.  We can see the manner in which the whole committee system has evolved in recent years.  In accordance with this piece of legislation, there will be an element of interaction between Government and committees in the normal course.  There is already a process which will involve the Oireachtas and enable it to exercise appropriate scrutiny and exercise power and authority to reject, overturn or set aside.  My difficulty here is that I believe the safeguards already enshrined in law and already included in this piece of legislation are sufficient to allow for the level of engagement that Deputy Daly and Deputy Wallace seek.  The amendment, however, seeks a positive resolution, which from time to time can be particularly onerous.  It is not necessary in the circumstances, having regard to the manner in which instruments are drawn up, agreed by Government on the advice of the Attorney General, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and dealt with here, as I am sure this committee has, within the statutory period of 21 days.  My point is that I see a sufficient body of safeguards there.

That is not a matter of disrespect to anyone in Ireland, but is rather to get some fresh blood and fresh thinking into the appointments process.  That will be particularly important for this role.  A similar provision exists in the IHREC legislation around the appointment of members.

Section 15 deals with the membership of the proposed data protection commission.  My amendments Nos. 16, 17 and 18 merely insert a new paragraph on the matter of the retirement age of a commissioner under subsection (9).  As regards the appointment of commissioners, section 15 allocates the task of making a recommendation for appointment as a commissioner to the Public Appointments Service.  Indeed, committee members will be aware that PAS acts independently of Government and is responsible for the preparation of job specifications, advertising competitions, screening applicants and assembling interview boards.<\/p><p>It is fair to say that the service discharges these tasks in a most efficient manner.  With regard to the process to appoint the current commissioner, I understand that efforts were made successfully to attract suitable applicants from outside the State.  I believe a high-ranking member of an external data protection authority was involved in the final selection process.  Deputy O'Callaghan suggested that an open selection competition be held.  As I understand it, that is the normal <i>modus operandi<\/i>of PAS.  With regard to the proposal that the chair of the European Data Protection Board, EDPB, should nominate a member of the selection panel, it is not clear if the Deputy has inquired as to whether this is a task that that chair might, in the circumstances, be willing to undertake.  It would be unusual and, I dare say, impolite at the least, if we were to impose a task on the chair of the European Data Protection Board without consulting about the matter or indeed reaching agreement with that office beforehand.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the amendments of Deputies Daly and Wallace, similar considerations apply.  They suggest that the European Data Protection Supervisor, rather than the chair of the EDPB, should nominate a member of the panel.  It is not clear if there has been any consultation or agreement on the matter of such involvement.  I welcome the principle of external participation.  I am concerned about what would happen if the positions of the chair of the European Data Protection Board or European Data Protection Supervisor were vacant for a period.  Such vacancies would be outside our control.  Presumably, it would mean that the selection of a commissioner cannot proceed until that European position is filled.  I have the impression, which I think is fair and reasonable, that the filling of these positions may take some time because of the involvement of the various institutions of the community.  We have experience of that from the past.  The proposed subsection (10) as tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly would appear to require the Government to satisfy itself that the Public Appointments Service nominee is suitably qualified and has the necessary experience, expertise and training.  I am concerned about any undue interference or suggestion that we are revisiting the PAS process after the event.  We all know about the difficulties of perceived politicisation of these appointments.  I am not sure if this is a desirable step.  I would have a difficulty with it.  I would also add to that difficulty that it is in conflict with the GDPR in any event.  I have a problem with amendment No. 15 but I am willing to look at amendments Nos. 11 to 14, inclusive.  I will look at the overall content of section 15 but I ask members to give careful consideration to the points that I make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#G02300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>I support the tenor and principle of all those amendments.

There will be consensus on the fact that there are enormous risks and dangers in terms of the cynical professional targeting of children by corporations.  They seek to take advantage of children to sell them goods and services.  Many of these products and goods are harmful, either in general or when taken to excess.  There are huge dangers and there are many young people in particular who are not aware of the extent to which their data is being gathered, the profile that is being built up on them and the way it is being used to exploit them.  It is reasonable to say that people under the age of 18 should not be micro-targeted in this way and they should be protected from that form of advertisement, which is often very cynical and exploitative.<\/p><p>I will be supporting amendment No. 27 with some degree of hesitancy.  I take a contrary view to the Ombudsman for Children and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, with some trepidation.  It is quite a complex area and is much broader than some of the discussion we have had hitherto which has focused on the area of predatory behaviour, which is not necessarily relevant to this.  This area is focused very much on data protection and the protection of children from the exploitation and manipulation of their data.  There is also a considerable body of opinion and expertise which has outlined the manner in which children are put at risk simply by the micro-targeting and the fact that at that age they will be in a position to give their consent to the giving away of their data.<\/p><p>I am supporting the amendment, but I believe we should keep it under review on an ongoing basis.  If, as looks apparent, amendment No. 27 is carried, we need to keep a very open mind on it.  We must be conscious that it is not a silver bullet.  Some people will try to present this as an almost foolproof defence for people under the age of 16.  It is vitally important that people are under no illusions as to the fact that people under the age of 16 will still be very vulnerable online, as will the population quite generally, and that there is a need for many additional measures, including the digital safety commissioner, which I have proposed and about which I have been in contact with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I have had a Bill passed on the issue of greater education for parents and children in schools and at home.  Issues such as default privacy settings also need to be worked on.  There is no digital age of consent at the moment.  It will move from 13 to 16.  We will support the amendment, but will add a health warning on the strength of that.  I believe there is consensus on the micro-targeting aspect, and I urge the Minister to work with all the members of the committee and others outside the committee to ensure that this is done and done properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#K00700","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1581,"content":"<p>I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 27 and 30 in this grouping.  Amendment No. 27 relates to the digital age of consent, which as it stands offers very little protection to children and young people, despite the fact that Recital 38 notes that, \"Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences and safeguards concerned.\"  Article 8 of the GDPR provides very little specific protection for children.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about a matter of contractual capacity rather than child protection.  By lowering the age of consent we are setting the age far below the age we would expect young people to be capable of making informed decisions about their safety.  Instead, we are allowing them to enter into an agreement with companies, which in turn will monetise their data and online activity.  I believe most people would find that unacceptable.  By raising the age we are placing the onus on the companies to introduce more robust age verification procedures and ensuring that parents retain a right to play a role in their children's online activities, however limited that role may be.  There is a role for parents in the giving of contractual permission, and it should be retained, in my view, up to the age of 16.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the harvesting of children's data is much more important.  It is covered by amendment No. 30.  As the Minister will know, the Article 29 Working Party has clarified that the GDPR does not place an outright prohibition on the use of profiling tactics on children.<\/p><p>Recital 38 of the GDPR notes that specific protections should be put in place to protect children when their data is used for the purposes of marketing.  Despite this, neither recital materially affects the text of Articles 8 or 22.  We believe this is a significant failing of the GDPR, which should be addressed through our own domestic legislation.  <br\/><br\/>The amendment that I have tabled today aims to achieve the same outcome as those submitted by Deputies &Oacute; Laoghaire, Clare Daly and Wallace.  However, Deputy Catherine Murphy and I have chosen to specifically prohibit profiling activity rather than all processing of data to ensure the scope of the amendment is tightly focused.  I am not sure how practical it is to talk about prohibiting the processing of data.  The other amendments in this regard talk about the processing of data.  Data is processed for lots of different reasons and, therefore, there is a need to be more specific, in terms of this legislation, in outlawing the profiling for specific marketing and commercial purposes.  That is what this amendment seeks to do.<br\/><br\/>It is noteworthy that in replies to parliamentary questions that the Minister has consistently stated that the Children's Rights Alliance favours setting the digital age of consent at 13.  The group has called for the age limit to be introduced in conjunction with the statutory prohibition on the use of children's data for marketing purposes, which is an important point.  We may argue about whether the digital age of consent should be set at 13 or 16 years of age but the more important issue is whether companies can target children's data for the purposes of marketing.  The Children's Rights Alliance has been very clear about the matter.  It believes that there needs to be a statutory prohibition on the use of children's data in this way.  I note that this morning the Ombudsman for Children, Mr. Niall Muldoon, in an interview on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; made exactly the same point.  He argued for the age of consent to be set at 13 years but he said that the profiling of children and harvesting of their data for commercial purposes should be prohibited on a statutory basis.<br\/><br\/>I draw attention to the fact that the Irish Heart Foundation has called for a ban on the marketing of junk food to children to address the wholly inappropriate level of access, which online companies have through their media platforms.  Last month, Mr. Chris Macey attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  On that occasion he made a very strong plea when he said:  <\/p><blockquote>Junk food brands have achieved a wholly inappropriate proximity to children, pestering them relentlessly in school, at home and even in their bedrooms through their smart phones.  It is called &quot;brand in the hand&quot; and it gives marketers constant access to children.  Junk food marketing involves the world's best marketing brains in the biggest agencies relentlessly targeting children every single day.  The damaging impact of overselling their products has created a market failure that the State must resolve.  We know voluntary codes do not work.  Sadly, the State's response has been feeble to date. <\/blockquote><p>The Irish Heart Foundation has a specific concern about the relentless targeting of children for the promotion of junk funds.  However, many brands and products are promoted.  I think that the vast majority of people find it repugnant that online companies can target children in this manner.  It is for that reason that the amendment proposes to outlaw the harvesting of children's data up to the age of 18.  <br\/><br\/>The GDPR acknowledged that this sort of marketing is a real issue.  In light of the text of Recitals 38 and 71, I believe that this amendment is fully in line with the intent of the GDPR and would significantly strengthen child protection measures in this Bill.  I urge the Minister to support my amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#K00800","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1583,"content":"<p>I have one amendment in this grouping and it is amendment is No. 27.  Similarly to Deputy Shortall, my amendment seeks to change the age of digital consent from 13 years of age to 16 years of age.<\/p> <p>  As we are all aware, under the GDPR each country is given leeway as to what age it wishes to set the digital age of consent.  Let us remember that it can be between 13 years and 16 years.  There are arguments on both sides.  Fianna F&aacute;il has come down, on balance, in favour of setting the digital age of consent at 16 years.  I shall give an overview as to the party's thinking on the matter.  Obviously the Internet provides children with very many great benefits.  It provides them with benefits in terms of their ability to access information.  Even by using applications, or apps, it provides great advantages to children and helps them to keep in touch with groups such as football teams and allows them  to co-ordinate their communication online.  It is very beneficial.<\/p> <p>  The Internet also has very negative consequences such as children obsessively using the Internet and mobile phones.  These are issues that go beyond the parameters of what is contained within the Bill that is before this committee today.  We must recognise the fact that children are growing up exposed to levels of intrusion and information that none of us here was exposed to when we were growing up.  There is a huge responsibility on parents when it comes to their children accessing information on the Internet and their use of social media apps.  There is also a responsibility on legislators.  We can play some role in respect of that and the digital age of consent in this legislation.<\/p> <p>  The premise from which we need to start is that generally in law a child cannot enter a contract until he or she reaches the age of 18, which is the age at which he or she is no longer a child.  In certain instances children can enter a contract such as to purchase life's necessities, buy food in shops and similar issues.  In general, the principal is that children cannot enter into contracts until they are 18 years of age.  <\/p> <p>  Section 30 refers to what age children can consent to giving access to their data.  The view of Fianna F&aacute;il is that 13 years of age is too young and the age of consent should be increased to 16 years of age.  The reason is that we want to ensure that children are protected from data profiling and commercial targeting.  What happens, as we can now see from our increased knowledge of large social media companies, is that individuals are commodified into groups and that information then becomes something which is marketable.  An individual is not marketable but an individual who is part of a larger group is a commodity because that group is a commodity and, therefore, can be used for the purpose of generating commercial gain for that social media company.  <\/p> <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that we should put further obligations on the social media companies to ensure that when children consent that there is an understanding as to what they are consenting to.  It is difficult for children of 13 years of age to recognise the extent to which they are consenting.  <\/p> <p>  One of the problems with people's interaction with social media, and social media apps online, is that sometimes when one first joins one's status is frozen from that time onwards.  So a person joins at a young naive age and he or she may have particular interests or objectives in terms of online searches.  That information can sometimes be frozen within a social media company and the child is presented as somebody who is always of these views.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest dangers we have from social media in general is the threat it poses to individualism.  As I said in the D&aacute;il about two weeks ago, the objective of social media is to put people into groups and then people think that they must think in accordance with what their group believes as opposed to what their individual thoughts are.  Sometimes people have different views in respect of people with whom they have similar thoughts on other matters.  Unfortunately, the weakness of this commodification of individuals into groups is that there is a tendency to merge people into groups thus generating groupthink.  I also think this practice is anti-intellectual in the long run.<\/p><p>I am sure members will legitimately turn around and say that Deputy O'Callaghan was a member of this committee, as was Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, that produced a pre-legislative report on the Data Protection Bill, which raised without demur or objection that the digital age of consent should be set at 13 years.  That is correct, we did do that.  <\/p><p> When I am dealing with issues on a committee basis, I am not running back up to the fourth floor to the Fianna F&aacute;il offices to find out the Fianna F&aacute;il view on this.  Deputy Chambers and I are Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies but we are working as part of the committee.  At a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il Front Bench we had a very thorough and detailed engagement on this issue and there is genuine concern that not enough is being done to protect children who are accessing information online.  It was thought that the least we could do is to try to put more of the obligation on social media companies as opposed to on the parents and on the individual child and set the digital age of consent at 16 years.  For that reason, I will be pressing amendment No. 27.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#L00200","speaker":"1296","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1585,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan.

We will be supporting the Government's section 30 which sets the age of consent of child in relation to information society services at 13 years of age.  We think this is the right way forward.  We, as were all the committee members, very impressed by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon when he appeared before the committee.  Let me remind people of what he said at that meeting.  He said that Ireland should take the opportunity now to designate the lowest permissible age, namely 13, as the age of digital consent for this jurisdiction.  This lower digital age of consent has also been recommended by children's organisations, such as the Children's Rights Alliance.<\/p> <p>  He also said that prior to the committee he took the opportunity to discuss the issue with the Ombudsman for Children who supports his view that the age of digital consent should be set at 13 years of age.  I know that Deputy Shortall has raised points around that but members will see from amendment No. 29 in the names of Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace that we have dealt with the harvesting of children's data, which has been raised.<\/p> <p>  A variety of competing children's rights and practical realities support the argument that the appropriate age, having regard to the permissible age range delineated by the GDPR, should be the lowest age possible.  He went on to say that the right of the child to participate and be heard in proceedings concerning him or her is a fundamental principle of international children's rights law and is enshrined by Article 12 of UN convention on the rights of the child. and in Article 24 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  He states that the importance of the voice of the child and the child's right to participate in all matters have been promoted recently in this jurisdiction when the Irish people voted in a referendum on children's rights, which must mean something.  He also states that freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are very important.  The right to freedom of expression is a human right that is not confined in its remit to adults.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC guarantees a child's enjoyment of freedom of expression in Article 13.  Further related rights under the UNCRC include the right to access appropriate information provided in Article 17 and the freedom to assemble peacefully, such assembly may take place in the context of an online environment.  We need to realise that the world has changed and that these basic human rights are as relevant in the online world as they are in the world to which we are accustomed.  That needs to be acknowledged in our legislation.  These rights are often exercised by children through their use of information and communication technology.  <\/p> <p>  We have tabled three amendments to this section.  Our amendment No. 28 proposes that Tusla maintains a register of preventative or counselling services for the purposes of section 30 of the Bill.  There is a later related amendment, No. 246, to amend section 8(1) of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.<\/p> <p>  Section 30 relates to the consent of a child in relation to information society services, which is clearly a positive thing.  Information society services are essentially online shops, live or on-demand streaming services such as Netflix or Spotify that need to be paid for.  So-called preventative or counselling services are exempted here, these might include Childline, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children or groups that offer advice to children about mental health or drug or alcohol abuse.  Under the GPDR, data controllers do not need to get the consent of parents or guardians when they are processing a child's data, when that data is related to preventative or counselling services offered directly to the child.  This amendment is proposing that to prevent abuse of this exemption, Tusla should maintain a register of such preventative or counselling services to safeguard against abuse of the exemption.  One concern in the Bill is that it does not provide a definition of preventative or counselling services.  Is it safe therefore not to have a register of such services?  The amendments that we are proposing, that Tusla maintains a register of these services, seems like a sensible provision.<\/p> <p>  In amendment No. 29, in the name of Deputy Claire Daly and Wallace, which is similar to amendments tabled by other Deputies, we are repeating the wording of an amendment tabled by Senator Lynn Ruane in the Seanad.  I respect and accept the opinion of Dr. Geoffrey Shannon on setting the digital age of consent at 13 years and I think the age of consent should remain at 13 years, as stated in the Bill.  I understand and appreciate some of the arguments for raising the digital age of consent to closer to 16 years, that certain Senators and Deputies have made, however, including a prohibition on profiling and direct marketing to children under 16 years would surely go a long way to addressing the fears that people have on the digital age of consent being set at 13 years.  This is not an unreasonable request.  It should not be possible and legal to track a child's progress online and be able to create a detailed digital profile of that child and then specifically micro target him or her based on the profile created.  This kind of digital marketing is incredibly powerful and it would surely be a progressive step to shield children from it.  The parents of Ireland would thank us for doing that.<\/p> <p>  In the second part of amendment No. 29, we propose to insert a new subsectrion (4).  This adheres to Senator Ruane's Seanad amendment and is a reasonable attempt to protect parents being profiled and targeted via their children's online activity, though arguably Articles 6 and 9 of the GDPR prohibits this kind of profiling.  Will the Minister clarify that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#M00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1587,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak on amendment No. 27.  WhatsApp is going to ask new users to confirm that they are aged 16 years, Facebook will ask children between 13 years and 15 years to nominate a parent or guardian to grant permission, children who do not have parental permission for Facebook will see a generic version of Facebook that is not customised, based on their personal data.  This shows that children will continue to have access to the Internet, but their data will not be exploited.  Setting the digital age at 16 years will not mean that a 13 year old cannot use Facebook, which I am using as an example, however, it will mean that Facebook cannot use the 13 year old.  The child will be protected from targeted advertising derived from personal data.  This is not so different from the rules placing a ban on advertisements targeted at children in the offline world, including broadcasting.  The point is that while people may make the argument that no matter whether the age of digital consent is set at 13 years or 16 years, the technology is not yet available to check age verification at this stage and that a young person of 13 years could pretend to be older.<\/p><p>We are putting an onus on social media companies to ensure they are adhering to a clear legal guideline; they are not allowed to exploit the data of somebody within that age cohort for commercial purposes.  That is the protection we are seeking to put in place.  <\/p><p> We all agree with the arguments of prominent people like Dr. Geoffrey Shannon on the issue of child protection.  One could argue that the drafters of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child could not possibly have foreseen companies like Facebook and WhatsApp, commercial companies that can exploit children and use their information.  They can use their name, address and date of birth and geotag them; they know exactly where they are and have access to all of their photographs.  They can use that information for nefarious purposes and most definitely drive their bottom line.<\/p><p> What we are seeking to do in putting forward this amendment is to keep in line with many other European countries who are also in this space.  Those states are interpreting the regulation from the European Union.  We are also seeking to ensure we do not have a situation where children aged 13 to 16 years are being exploited and their information is being used to commercial advantage.  We wish to put the onus back on social media companies.  I repeat that WhatsApp and Facebook have already announced their intention to adopt a uniform approach in line with that taken in other European countries in how they use data.  They are putting protocols in place to that effect.  I, therefore, ask the Government to accept a digital age of consent of 16 years on the basis that the market seems to be moving in that direction.  Social media companies are moving it way and we should not be behind the curve in how we interpret the regulation.  We should at least be on it, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#M00400","speaker":"1276","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1589,"content":"<p>This is a group of amendments that has attracted a lot of interest.  In some ways, that is disappointing.  Issues are being conflated.  To me, the concentration on the digital age of consent is a little like focusing on a fly on the wall when there is a giant elephant in the room about which no one is even talking.  All of the other provisions in the Bill are of far greater consequence.  Setting the digital age of consent at 13 years is not going to do what some Deputies fear it is going to do.  For example, in response to the last speaker's points about Facebook, I note that this is a proposal that has already been made by it.  The Oireachtas setting the digital age of consent at 13 years will have absolutely no bearing on it whatsoever, whereas our protective measures regarding micro-targeting in amendment No. 29 would cover that point.  we are conflating issues incorrectly.<\/p><p>It would be very remiss of us not to take the advice of people like Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the Ombudsman for Children and all of the children's rights organisations which have stated very clearly that the digital age of consent should be set at 13 years.  We fully support that advice.  It is separate from the other measures and I will park that issue.  I will not repeat points made on it.  Deputy Mick Wallace is right.  Not dealing with it is a little like the old approach to under-age sex - just do not do it - rather than the modern thinking that providing progressive sex education is better.  This is the same.  Educating young people and putting the onus on providers is a far better way forward.  Setting the age at 16 years seems good.  It sounds like a protective measure but actually it is not.  As has been pointed out, it subjects young people to abusive parents, for example.  It puts another responsibility on parents with which, in many instances, they may not be capable of dealing.  The onus should be put on service providers.  That is what our other amendment tries to do.<\/p><p>I will address some of the simpler amendments first just to get them out of the way.  I refer to amendment No. 28.  As Deputy Mick Wallace said, we know that the general data protection regulation, GDPR, exempts preventive and counselling services from the general provisions on the digital age of consent.  In other words, children under the digital age of consent will be allowed to access these services without parental consent.  The question is how they are identified.  My fear is that a register would be needed.  In the absence of a register services could deny services to a child under the digital age of consent to be on the safe side.  It might be a service a child needs.  In the worst case scenario a service could be taken to court by an abusive parent who finds out that his or her child has been using the service and decides to take revenge by burying it in litigation.  Good services that are helping children should not be targeted in that way.  We think Tusla is best placed to draw up such a register.  It would not be an onerous job for it to do so.  It should be quite easy for it.  That would be a helpful measure and require minimal work.<\/p><p>I will also address amendment No. 29 which concerns the issue of protecting children, in common with amendment No. 28 in the name of Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, amendment No. 30 in the name of the Social Democrats and amendment No. 34 in the name of the Minister, about which I would like to make a few points.  This is about the micro-targeting of children.  I have a slight concern that amendment No. 26 in the name of Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire might be a littletoo narrow and difficult to enforce.  It is a little like the argument about the prohibition in civil legislation on groups accepting donations that the donors intend to be used for political purposes.  Historically, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has found it impossible to enforce and has said so repeatedly.  It is hard to prove a reason someone is collecting data.  The amendment really just states they cannot use the data for marketing purposes.  I am open to arguments, but we have a concern about Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire's wording and think ours is better.  However, clearly the intention behind the two is the same.  The Social Democrats' amendment is also a little similar, but I do not see the necessity of using the word &quot;profile&quot;.  The word &quot;process&quot; is just fine and captures everything it needs to do.  Again, I think that amendment might be slightly narrow.<\/p><p>The Minister's amendment is about the idea of preventing children from being targeted in marketing.  He is proposing a code of conduct which the commission will encourage companies to draw up.  It is not bad, but our amendment is stronger.  However, I am open to being persuaded.  The second part of the amendment, with which Deputy Mick Wallace dealt, needs less explanation.  It sets the digital age of consent at 13 years and requires parents to engage with companies and give their consent for their child to access services online.  The <i>quid pro quo <\/i>must be the assurance that their data will not be harvested for something like marketing, profiling or whatever else.  I know that issue is generally covered under the GDPR, but there would not be any harm in making it explicit.  I will not repeat the points made by Deputy Mick Wallace, but we are taking on board the amendments brought forward by Senator Lynn Ruane in the Seanad.  They strike a better balance in protecting children in their Internet usage.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#N00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1590,"content":"<p>I will not repeat points made by Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly.  However, as a committee member, it is appropriate to state we did work on this issue as a committee.  There is a process in which committees engage.  It is a vital part of drafting and putting together the approach to be taken to legislation.  We looked at the issue; brought people in and listened to them and made a judgment, particularly with reference to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's contribution.  The judgement was well thought out and made having listened to experts give voice to all sides to the argument.  It is not easy to make up one's mind on this issue.  It is regrettable, having gone through that process and looked at the issue as a committee and made our decision, that it is now being revisited.<\/p><p>I still believe the age should be 13, for the reasons that have been outlined and for the reasons the committee originally supported.  It is sometimes easy for politicians of all parties and none to see something that looks like a very acceptable and widely supported political solution.  However, we have to look at the realities of the situation and find a workable solution, one that I fundamentally believe is in the best interests of the protection of children.  We must ensure the proper use of data, control it and not have it used for exploitative purposes.  It seems to me that moving the age of digital consent from 13 to 16 is just choosing the easy option, the option that sounds good and which has gained much credibility because people who have not had the opportunity to look at the issue in the same level of detail have moved their position to it.  If I had not sat at this committee and looked into the issue, and if I did not have the benefit of hearing from the Ombudsman for Children and reading that report I might have thought that the idea of moving the digital age of consent to 16 was the right idea.  Having gone into at length in this committee, I am firmly of the belief that the best solution is that the digital age of consent should be set at 13.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#N00300","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1592,"content":"<p>I listened with great interest to the various contributions of committee members on the current group of nine amendments, including amendments to sections 30 and 31 and a proposed new section, all of which are concerned with the protection of children.  Indeed, for that reason we are discussing these amendments as a group.  Notwithstanding that, it would be helpful, having regard to the discussion we have had, if I dealt with each amendment separately, commencing with amendment No. 27, tabled by Deputies Sherlock, Shortall, O'Callaghan and Catherine Murphy, proposing a digital age of consent of 16 years in section 30.<\/p> <p>  The position, of course, is that article 8 of the GDPR specifies a digital age of consent of 16 but allows member states to provide for a lower age not below 13.  Article 8 will mean that providers of information society services must make reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the holder of parental responsibility over the child where such services are offered directly to children below the specified age threshold.  I acknowledge the extent and the importance of the discussion we had in the Seanad and elsewhere over the past year or more.  I am quite satisfied that there are sincere and strongly held views in favour of both 13 years, as provided for in the Bill, and 16 years, which is the subject matter of amendments.  <\/p> <p>  I want to talk about process here, and acknowledge the importance of the public consultation process that took place before any decision was taken by Government on this issue.  I believe that is how legislation should be processed.  Indeed, following completion of these consultations carried out by my Department on the Government's data forum, which brings together legal and data protection experts, business representatives, small and medium sized industry, multinationals, sociologists, psychologists and education specialists, the Government decided in favour of a digital age of consent of 13 years.  I want to stress that full account was taken of the knowledge of those that responded to the consultation process in reaching the decision, and a careful consideration was given to the expertise of this body of opinion.  A majority of respondents, including the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, the ISPCC, the Internet Safety Advisory Committee and the Childrens' Rights Alliance clearly recommended a digital age of consent of 13 years.  Moreover, as Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly in particular mentioned, this committee will recall the contribution of the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, who recommended a digital age of consent of 13.  That strong recommendation was adopted by the Joint Committee in this room in the Chair's report of last November.  I acknowledge the work of that committee.  The content of that committee report, and indeed the disposition of committee members, was very much considered in the context of the Government's decision here.  I was keen, at all times, that the views of this committee would be taken into consideration in my deliberation with Government colleagues. <\/p> <p>  Having regard to the due process, the Government considers that a digital age of consent of 13 years does represent an appropriate balancing of the child's right to participation in the online environment and the child's right to safety and protection.  These rights are enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  In making that decision, and in choosing the age of 13, Ireland is not out of line with many other EU states.  The age of 13 has been adopted by Denmark, Sweden and Finland.  These are member states that we often look to as an example of good practice in the area of child protection and child and family support.  I can also point to other countries which have opted for the age of 13, including our nearest neighbour, the UK, Spain and Latvia.  As we are deliberating here and processing this legislation, other countries are having the same debate.<\/p> <p>  For many reasons, I am unable to accept amendment No. 27, which seeks to replace 13 with 16.  I was struck by the contribution of some Deputies here who said they were reluctantly supporting the amendment or that they were doing so with a health warning.  I am not sure that represents good practice, and I am concerned that in many respects there is a move to depart from or abandon what was a programme of good process.  I welcomed the discussion in the Seanad and proposed the inclusion of subsection 3 which provides for the review of the operation of the 13 year old threshold within three years.  I put that forward to the members here who have indicated that they are conflicted.  Article 8(3) of the GDPR provides that the providers of information society services must make reasonable efforts to verify that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental authority, specifying that available technology must be taken into consideration by the controller, and that it is highly likely that the European Data Protection Board will issue further guidelines in this matter and move towards the identification of best practice, as it is entitled to under article 70.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of difficulties with amendments Nos. 28 and 246, in which Deputies Daly and Wallace seek to impose an obligation on Tusla to maintain a register of preventative counselling services.  The services referred to here are not only those established in this State, so there is no good reason for it.  A teenager in a Border county may well be using a counselling service in Northern Ireland; I am sure the Chair can relate to that example.  Likewise, there is no good reason to prevent a teenager in Dublin or in any part of Ireland whose native language may be Polish, Lithuanian or any language other than English from taking advantage of a counselling service based in other countries.<\/p><p>We need to acknowledge the practical manifestation of everyday living, the freedom of movement and the fluidity or social mobility in society.  The amendment seeks, in effect, to define the scope of the preventative and counselling services referred to in Article 8 of GDPR, which I am afraid would amount to an infringement of GDPR.  As I said earlier, we will need to exercise great care in departing from the import of the GDPR itself.<\/p><p> I will briefly turn to children&rsquo;s personal data - amendments Nos. 26, 29 and 30, tabled by Deputies Clare Daly, Wallace, Shortall, Murphy and &Oacute; Laoghaire, seeking to impose prohibitions on the processing of children's personal data for marketing and for profiling purposes.  I have a difficulty with the amendments.  Processing personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called legitimate interests ground in Article 6.1.(f) of GDPR.  Recital 47 states specifically that the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest.  It is important to note in that regard that the European Court of Justice addressed the issue of whether national law can impose additional conditions on processing carried on under the corresponding Article 7. (f) of the 1995 directive.  In that regard the Court of Justice underlined the importance of free movement of personal data under the 1995 regime.  It concluded that member states were not in a position to add new principles or impose additional conditions to have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds in Article 7 of the directive.  Those grounds are now in Article 6.1.(f) of GDPR.  In short, the imposition of prohibitions or limitations in national law on the processing of personal data that is lawful under GDPR is in breach of EU law and that could well have a consequence of exposing the State to infringement proceedings or possible sanctions of a type that we are familiar with.<\/p><p> I wish to go back to the Seanad debate because I think it is very important and informative for what we are doing here.  Mention was made by Deputy Wallace of the contribution of Senator Lynn Ruane.  It was a very strong contribution.  I agree with Deputy Wallace in that regard.  Senator Ruane was speaking not only as a Senator but as a mother of teenage children and as somebody who has engaged in children's issues to a very positive extent since she was elected to the Seanad.  During the course of the Seanad debate one could see how her positioning evolved in the context of her own practical experience.  That was really important.  She was very helpful and very positive, as indeed were other Senators.  I introduced a new section 31 in the Seanad, which makes specific provision for codes of conduct for the protection of children and I now propose amendments Nos. 32, 33 and 34 in response to Second Stage discussions here, including what was a constructive contribution from Deputy Shortall who joins us this morning.  Those amendments introduce protection for children where there is processing of their personal data for the purposes of direct marketing and creating personality and user profiles.  I think that is positive and I believe it meets the concern of Deputies.  I thank Deputy Shortall for a positive contribution in that regard.<\/p><p> In order to remain compliant with Article 40 of GDPR, section 31 does place an obligation on the supervisory authorities such as the Data Protection Commission to encourage the drawing up of codes of practice.  I listened carefully to Deputy Clare Deputy in that regard and I am conscious of her amendment but placing a specific obligation on the commission to draw up such codes would be in conflict with GDPR compliance.  The conflict would arise because of the obligation placed on the commission under Article 40.5 to provide an opinion on such a code and to approve it where it finds the code provides sufficient safeguards.  If the code is intended to apply in other member states the commission will submit it to the consistency mechanism for approval then by all member states.  I think that is what will happen.  In that regard I am unable to accept the proposals from Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace as far as amendment No. 31 is concerned, to replace \"encourage\" with \"require\" but I very much acknowledge the points Deputy Clare Daly made and I am in agreement with the overall point she made, but there is a limit to how we can mandate the supervisory authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#O00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1594,"content":"<p>I shall briefly give my views on the other amendments because I do not think I did when I spoke earlier.  In respect of amendment No. 26 in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, it is a bit vague to put in a reference to \"for the purposes of financial gain\" so I will not support the amendment.  In respect of amendment No. 28, which is proposed by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace which would limit the counselling services to those maintained on a register of Tusla, I listened to the Minister and I think he made some very valid points to the effect that Tusla could have names which do not extend outside of the jurisdiction.  Because of what the Minister said I will not support amendment No. 28.  In terms of amendment No. 29, my inclination was to support that but the Minister has now said that if we introduce it we will be in breach of European law because it goes beyond what is contained within the GDPR, and that it would expose Ireland to enforcement proceedings.  If a Minister says that to me and that is the advice of the Department and that is the legal advice he has received, I am afraid I have to responsibly listen to that as I do not want to expose the country to enforcement proceedings which may arise.  The same argument was made by the Minister in respect of amendment No. 31, in terms of changing the wording from \"encourage\" to \"require\".<\/p> <p>  In terms of the amendment to change the digital age of consent from 13 years to 16 years, I listened very carefully to the contributions and ultimately it is a political choice.  We have very limited powers to a certain extent when we are bringing in the GDPR but we do have the power to determine whether we set the age at 13 or as much as 16.  That is a political choice.  I have not heard any real argument here today as to why the capacity of children to contract should be changed in such a fundamental way whereby now they will have the capacity to contract in respect of their personal data at the age of 13.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#P00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1595,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall and then Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#P00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1596,"content":"<p>I wish to come back on a couple of points.  First, on the age of consent, there are two reasons I proposed to raise that to 16.  The first is in respect of contract law.  The minimum age for participation in a contract is 16.  Equally, the age to give consent for a medical procedure is 16, and it makes sense to bring it into line with that.  Whether it is 13 or 16 I do not think people should be lulled into any false sense of security here in relation to the safety of children on the Internet.  The difficulty many people have with the actions of online companies is that kind of relentless targeting of children, the harvesting of their data, the profiling of children and their families and then targeting them for commercial or marketing purposes.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has not given his own opinion on whether he believes that is an acceptable practice.  We know that it is happening on a widespread basis at the moment.  What is his view on that?  Does he think it is acceptable that our children are subjected to that kind of marketing?  Neither did the Minister respond to the issue I raised earlier on the age of consent although he quoted the Children's Rights Alliance and the children's Ombudsman in respect of the age of consent.<\/p><p>The Minister has not responded on the more important issue, the need to introduce, in conjunction with this, a statutory prohibition on the use of children's data for marketing purposes.  What is his response to the statement made by both bodies?<\/p><p> I expressed the view that the amendments from Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly were too wide insofar as there were issues related to market research, legitimate activities in that respect and demographic analysis of activities online.  They are legitimate activities.  For that reason, I would be more in favour of a prohibition on the profiling of children's data.  That is in line with Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment.  <\/p><p> The Minister talked about encouraging voluntary codes of conduct.  We know that voluntary codes of conduct do not work with online companies and that they have only taken action where they have been found to be doing something that they should not be doing.  We also know that originally in the general data protection regulation, GDPR, prohibiting the profiling of children's data was raised.  We also know that there was much pressure exerted by online companies and it continues.  I have been contacted by companies, as I am sure others have.  Online and digital companies do not want a prohibition on the profiling of children's data.  They want to have a free hand to harvest children's data and use them for their own commercial purposes such as direct marketing.  Most people find this unacceptable and the Minister has not provided a strong case for not prohibiting that practice.  Let us forget about voluntary codes of conduct and encouraging companies.  It will only happen if companies are precluded by domestic law from engaging in this practice.  We have an opportunity to do so to protect childhood from the relentless targeting that happens for marketing purposes.<\/p><p> This is a much more significant issue than the digital age of consent and many recognised bodies are calling for it to happen.  Children deserve to be allowed to live their childhood without their data being used for marketing purposes.  The Minister should heed what is being stated by the Children's Rights Alliance, the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Heart Foundation and many other organisations that have children's interests to the fore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#P00400","speaker":"1222","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1598,"content":"<p>Three of the amendments are relatively similar.  I will echo the point made by Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, that the right call is being made about the digital age of consent.  A great deal more is needed to ensure the safety online of children and the population at large which I have said in passing as it is not just children who are at risk online.  There are advantages and disadvantages for us all.  We all need to be more careful online, as well as enjoying the benefits of the online experience.  <\/p> <p>  Three amendments deal with micro-targeting and data harvesting for the purposes of targeting young people.  It is a vitally important and massive issue and it is welcome that the Minister has moved towards improving the obligation to have codes of conduct in that respect.  There is a general issue about children on which we are all in agreement, that there is a need to ensure this exploitation and cynical targeting is brought to an end and that it will be an offence to engage in it.  As I said, there are disadvantages and advantages for all of us and they need to be refined on Report Stage.  It would probably be better to focus on profiling, but I take the point made about engaging in such practices for the purposes of financial gain.  I will press my amendment and will support the others.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has outlined the conflict with the GDPR which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has accepted to a large extent.  Everyone has to take serious cognisance of the possibility of fines or regulatory action by the European Union.  We have to take that issue seriously, but it is not enough to flag it in general.  It is not clear to me how it could be in conflict with the GDPR.  There are areas in which the legislation is in conflict with the GDPR where ostensibly they provide for very similar provisions, but there are differences in wording.  As I said, there are conflicts in that regard and I will oppose sections on that basis.  I do not see anywhere where it is stated in the GDPR that states cannot make an offence the profiling of children's data and create fines.  There is nothing in the principles, letter or recitals of the GDPR that makes it apparent to me that there would be a problem in doing so.  If there would be, we need some further detail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Q00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1599,"content":"<p>I received some correspondence yesterday from a Dr. James O'Higgins Norman, associate professor of sociology at Dublin City University, DCU.  He says that as an international and Irish academic working in the field of child Internet safety with an holistic knowledge and understanding of how children engage online, he firmlys believe setting the age of digital consent at 13 years offers the best defence for children's safety and data protection.  He says calls for the age to be set higher, at 16 years, for example, are misguided and not endorsed by child protection professionals and those working with children.  He says that, under such a system, children aged 13, 14 and 15 years would need parental consent to allow their personal data to be processed by this information society service and that, all the while, there is a general acceptance that current systems of age verification are weak and generally easy to bypass.  He asks what unintended safety and protection consequences this will this have, saying attempting to change the behaviour of 13, 14 and 15 year olds by 25 May is not practical.  He says the Internet and being online are a fundamental part of most children's lives today and that, to support children's safety, they need digital literacy education, that parents need support and the industry needs to be regulated.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire made a point about amendment No. 29.  I accept the points the Minister made about amendment No. 28, at which we will have to look again with reference to the register maintained by Tusla.  On amendment No. 29, the Minister said that if we were to go down that path, we would contravene the GDPR.  We do not know enough about it to know whether that is definitely true, but we will have to examine it because we believe it would be a positive move to have amendment No. 29 in the Statute Book.  It would make sense.  It is disappointing if the GDPR has moved away, under pressure, from this position, but we will certainly look at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Q00300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1600,"content":"<p>On amendment No. 28, I know that the issue of the maintenance of a register was discussed in the Seanad.  The Minister made some good points about the limitations of our proposal.  We thought it was an alternative in dealing with the limitations mentioned in the Seanad about the Data Protection Commissioner being the person to maintain a register.  That proposal was shot down on the grounds that the commissioner might not have the expertise to do so.  Children being able to access relevant and important preventive and counselling services without parental consent is important, particularly for vulnerable children in cases where the parent is the abuser.  We have to take this into account because, in that context, if we do not define what they are and have a register, a devious, abusive parent could come down heavily on a service provider or a child might not be able to access information that would otherwise be useful.<\/p><p>Will the Minister have a look at this?  Is there another way we can come up with some type of register that would give protection to children?  We will withdraw the amendment for now but I call on the Minister to look at that aspect of it.<\/p><p> Deputy Shortall made a point about profiling and processing with regard to our amendment.  We have to be clear on this point.  The word \"profiling\" has a particular definition under the general data protection regulation, as distinct from processing.  In particular, \"processing\" is the word used for analysing, that is to say, using data for a particular process.  In other words, we use processes in order to profile rather than starting with profiling.  That is why it is important that the word \"process\" is used.  It is for legal reasons and it gives far greater protection in that regard.<\/p><p> We have proposed amendment No. 29.  I am unsure about the level of protection of rights under the GDPR.  The regulation refers to the rules being equivalent and an obligation on member states to apply rules consistently.  I am unsure.  We cannot state categorically that what we have put forward will guarantee that the legislation goes beyond the GDPR.  Certainly, there is a risk that it could possibly so do.  If it were too onerous, some companies could say it does, but there is no guarantee that it will.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point is a little rich because the Government is taking far greater risks with things that are clearly not compatible with the GDPR, but he does not have a problem with them.  Yet, now he is saying that this measure goes beyond it.  That does not really wash with me.<\/p><p> People are confusing different issues.  Deputy Wallace read out a letter.  The key point for the committee to register is that these 13 experts and organisations have circulated their views online.  It is almost unprecedented.  The Ombudsman for Children said that we are making a mistake.  People are conflating issues rather than understanding them.  Deputy Sherlock comments represented the best example.  It is a pity he is not here because I would have no problem saying it to his face.  What he was proposing and looking for simply does not add up.  He talked about WhatsApp going to 16 years.  That simply makes what we are proposing, a digital age of consent, easier to maintain.  It has nothing to do with it.  The last line in the letter from the experts refers to how the digital age of consent is a data protection issue and not a child safety issue.  Using data protection law to achieve an online safety effect is misguided.  Almost every expert in the area of child protection is saying as much and we cannot be blind to that.<\/p><p> This goes back to the point I made earlier.  The other example given by Deputy Sherlock is utterly ludicrous and irrelevant.  Facebook has begun to make a change for people under 16 years.  That is exactly what we should be encouraging.  Setting the age of consent at 13 years is irrelevant for those purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Q00900","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1602,"content":"<p>Deputy Daly referred to the GDPR and the manner in which we might consider departing from it.<\/p><p>Article 47 states clearly that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carrying out processing for illegitimate interest.

It is not my legal advice or the advice of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I wish to state for the benefit of the committee member that we engaged on the issue raised by Deputy O'Callaghan with the Office of the Attorney General.  The advice appeared clear.  I am reluctant, therefore, to depart from the advice of the Attorney General.<\/p><p>I wish to address the amendments referred to by Deputies Daly and Wallace.  I too have the letter that both Deputies referenced.  There is considerable drawing down on expert opinion, experts and the status and influence of experts.  I do not disagree with any of the points that have been raised.  One of the signatures of the letter is Professor Mona O'Moore, who would be known to members of the committee.  She has years of experience in the area of children's issues.<\/p><p>I accept the fact that there are differing views.  I am keen to acknowledge the importance of the process and the report of the committee, wherein you stated, Chairman, in the foreword:<\/p><blockquote>The General Data Protection Regulation will grant significant rights to all citizens in Ireland, but will provide particular protections to children. The Committee has recommended that an appropriate digital age of consent for children is set, and that this age be reviewed as technology evolves.<\/blockquote> <p>This is exactly what we are doing in the context of the Bill.  We are setting the age at 13 years in accordance with the recommendations of the committee and others and allowing for a review at a future date.<\/p><p>I did not say earlier that consideration was also given by my Department and Government with regard to how a digital age of consent of 16 years would be difficult to monitor and enforce.  I am speaking as a father of two girls now in their 20s.  They grew up in an age when youngsters were far more tech-savvy than I was.  I assure the committee from my experience at home that children aged 13, 14 and 15 years of age have a great deal of knowledge and information technology literacy.  Whether we like it, they are in a position to circumvent requirements for parental consent and requirements relating to advices, regulation or whatever.  They can do so with relative ease because we do not have age verification methodologies.  This is also important in the context of setting ages.<\/p><p>I put it to Deputy Shortall that the matter of child protection is one that can be validly associated with this legislation.  It is not that the GDPR is directly involved in child protection matters but there are consequences.  One of the consequences is the putting together of an EU-wide code of conduct.  I see that as being a great advantage in providing protection for children irrespective of where the child is, where the controller is or where the processor is.  That is why the role of the Data Protection Commissioner, once given the power in this legislation to make a submission, is important.  I am quite satisfied that encouragement from this office and influence or authority from the office in Dublin will have the effect of playing into and participating in a European data protection board and code of compliance.  That will deal with many of the issues put forward in terms of child protection.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that amendment No. 34 will add a greater level of strength to our debate.  I am concerned about any departure from the strict reading of the GDPR for obvious reasons.  I have heard what Deputy Shortall has said, but she is not long out of government and she was not long in government either, as it happened.  It is simply not practically possible to put forward amendments that would have the consequence of bringing about infringement proceedings against Ireland.<\/p><p>I ask the Deputy to accept that on the basis of facts that are within her own knowledge by virtue of having been a Member of Parliament for a long time.  Her party supports Ireland's membership of the EU and is familiar with EU law.  We cannot dip in and out of EU law in the manner the Deputy would like us to believe we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#R00200","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1604,"content":"<p>Is the Minister saying we cannot protect children from direct marketing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#S00200","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1605,"content":"<p>Not at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#S00300","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1606,"content":"<p>We cannot protect children's data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#S00400","speaker":"1222"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1607,"content":"<p>Of course we can do that in conjunction with our EU colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#S00500","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1608,"content":"<p>When will we do it?

I cannot accept the deletion of this provision, as proposed in amendment No. 35.  It is an appropriate and legitimate provision.  In requiring the cost of implementation to be taken into account when additional obligations are being determined, especially with regard to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and microbusinesses, it is fully compliant with the GDPR.

The acceptance of our amendment would not preclude the Minister from considering the cost.  He would still be entitled to take cost into account in this context, but it would not be at an equal level with the other protections that exist.  It is important to draw that distinction in light of the seriousness of this matter.  We do not want a health insurance body that should be considered in this context to be in a position to argue that given that the Minister has to take account of cost, it is not obliged to have a data protection officer.

Amendment No. 36 is part of a bigger structural adjustment to this part of the Bill.  The insertion of the phrase &quot;in particular the following&quot; is intended as an extra layer of precaution for what is one of the more important sections of the Bill in that it functions as what the Minister might call a toolbox for many other sections.  Many other sections refer back to this section and the phrase &quot;in particular the following&quot; is used elsewhere in the Bill to stipulate extra protections or precautions, so it is not unreasonable to insist on its inclusion here.  Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 depend on each other.  The inclusion of the phrase &quot;subject to suitable and specific measures&quot; also appears many times in the Bill and points us back to section 35.  Section 35 and the suitable and specific measures contained therein are important for the most part and are lifted from various parts of the GDPR, but the way section 35 is organised in the Bill renders optional very important aspects of data protection.<\/p><p>The issue of explicit consent is something we will come back to on section 45.  I understand why explicit consent needs to be optional in section 35 as the GDPR provides for exemptions to explicit consent.  As we understand it, the GDPR does not provide for exemptions with regard to section 35(1)(b) and (c). <font color=\"#FF42F9\"> <\/font>I do not understand why limitations on access to personal data that are processed in the workplace should not be a mandatory measure in section 35.  The same applies to the issue of imposing time limits for the erasure of personal data and mechanisms to ensure these time limits are adhered to.  The purpose of our amendments is to rearrange section 35, delete some of the so-called suitable and specific measures, such as explicit consent, which is a necessity of the GDPR, and to separate others as mandatory, hence the use of &quot;shall&quot; instead of &quot;may&quot; in page 26, line 14, in amendment No. 42.<\/p><p>I will skip some of the following amendments because Deputy Daly will deal with them.  Amendment No. 43 should be taken together with amendment No. 47 to section 37.  They are essentially the same amendment.  The central point in this amendment is the requirement for the Minister to provide a written rationale should he or she proceed to introduce regulations that go against the advice of the data protection commission.  The amendment was proposed by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins in the Seanad and it seems to me to be entirely reasonable.  It seems sensible and entirely workable and appropriate that such a written rationale would be put before the Committee on Justice and Equality.  I do not see how it would compromise the independence of the commission.  The point is to ensure heightened accountability for the Minister when creating regulations.<\/p><p>There are a number of State projects about which the Data Protection Commissioner has concerns.  The commissioner has opened a section 10 investigation into the public services card and the single customer view which is one of the biggest data sharing projects in the history of the State.  It is almost unprecedented.<\/p><p>It is highly unusual and should set off alarm bells for the Government, yet the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which claims it is the data controller for the public services card project, continues to double down on the expansion of the project even though it knows that the coming into force of the GDPR is just around the corner.  We have an example of the Department and the Minister ignoring the advice of the Data Protection Commissioner and ploughing on regardless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#U02000","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1683,"content":"<p>This is a very important grouping but, unfortunately, it is cumbersome and deals with many issues, some of which are similar but not identical.  It is an important group of amendments for us and I will break them down because some are more interconnected than others.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 36 to 41, inclusive, involve tweaking what we call suitable and specific measures and how we get around that.  We have to see it in the context of section 35 which deals with these suitable and specific measures for processing data.  In general throughout the Bill, these measures apply to the processing of special categories of data and are used as a substitute for getting a person's consent to process his or her most sensitive data.  What is contained in these sections is significant.  Under Article 9 of the GDPR, processing of these categories is strictly prohibited unless one of ten conditions apply.  The first of those conditions is that the person has to give explicit consent.  That is fairly clear.  The other nine categories involve matters such as processing being legal if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject, for the purpose of public health, cross-border threats to health and other such matters.  Most of the conditions allowing special categories of data to be processed, apart from the one on explicit consent, have some aim to protect either the data subject's interests or the public interest.<\/p><p>Suitable and specific measures, which is the term we are examining, are used as an alternative to the obligation to get explicit consent.  That is contained in sections 39, 43, 45 to 47, inclusive, 49, 50, 54 and 65.  They will apply in many circumstances.  This is a significant part of the Bill for processing sensitive data in the context of employment and social welfare law, scientific or other research purposes, pensions, if the Government gets its way, getting a mortgage, and in the context of a substantial public interest, which we discussed previously.  The idea of suitable and specific measures is that they are technical and organisational safeguards such as limiting access by staff to sensitive data and so on.  We all remember the fellow who was selling the data in the then Department of Social Protection for &euro;23 a throw and all the rest.<\/p><p>In the Bill as it stands, there is a list of measures that might be in section 35(1) but none of them is mandatory.  In the case of the first one, consent, there is a reason they cannot be mandatory in every case.  For example, for statistical purposes it might not be viable for somebody from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to get consent to process statistics on the number of people of a particular religion in Ireland or whatever.  There are others, the ones that are subject to our amendment No. 38, that face no obstacle in terms of being mandatory.  Those are limitations on access to prevent unauthorised consultation, alteration or disclosure of this most sensitive data by staff, time limits on the length of time an organisation can hold on to data and targeted training for people who will be handling the data.<\/p><p>We believe it is reasonable that when suitable and specific measures are being used to give <i>carte blanche<\/i>to organisations or public bodies to access and process sensitive data, access limits, time limits for storage and training should be mandatory.  That is our key concern.  Also, the Government clearly envisages situations where measures to safeguard data should be mandatory in some instances.  We are saying we should not leave it to the individual Ministers but make it somewhat clearer now.  I will not go into a huge amount of detail but we want to have safeguards implemented to stop invasion.  We want that to be obligated rather than a minimum standard to apply.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 38.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 36 simply seeks to add the words &quot;in particular&quot; before a list of possible, suitable and specific measures.  The phrase &quot;in particular&quot; is used elsewhere in the Bill.  It is also used in the GDPR and the shorthand for it is that we should look at the measures first before we go looking for any others because the list of possible suitable and specific measures spelled out in section 35(1) are in part taken from the GDPR itself.  As they are important and potentially strong technical measures to safeguard people's privacy, we believe they should be considered first, in particular the measures that are being either implemented or laid out in the regulation.<\/p><p>In terms of amendment No. 37, the idea is to add to the list of measures that might be included among the suite of suitable and specific measures.  The ones we are proposing are modelled on the German law which incorporated the GDPR but seek to add other options such as testing the effectiveness of technical, organisational and security measures regularly to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing services and systems related to the processing of personal data, including the ability to restore availability and access rapidly in the event of a physical or technical incident.  It could be the case that a given Minister might specify additional measures such as these in regulations.  I accept that could happen but it appears to us that it would be far better and more useful to have a reminder in the legislation about, first, the importance of mandating organisations to test their safeguarding measures regularly rather than just putting them in place and realising ten years later that they are not fit for purpose and have leaked a great deal of data and, second, to keep their security systems up to date and ensure they cannot lose a pile of sensitive data just because there is a power cut or whatever.  That is perfectly reasonable.  That is the first grouplet.  I know this is difficult, technical and monumentally boring stuff, but as the amendments have been grouped in this way, we have to persevere.<\/p><p>Regarding amendment No. 42, if our amendments Nos. 37 to 41, inclusive, succeed, this one can probably be withdrawn because we have provided something similar in the previous amendments.  We are proposing in this amendment that, first, any regulations made under the section either to identify suitable and specific measures or specify that some of those measures are mandatory shall first identify different measures for different categories of personal data, different categories of controllers and so on and, second, specify that at least one of the measures set out in the list in section 35 is mandatory.  Regulations in regard to suitable and specific measures are a requirement in many different processing situations throughout the Bill.  They are crucial to safeguarding people's rights on their data, and because of that they should be granular and detailed.  They take into account the kinds of data being processed, by whom and the types of processing actions that are being taken.  It is important that at least one, but ideally more, of the measures listed in section 35 is made mandatory if the Minister is going to the bother of drawing up the regulations.<\/p><p>Our last amendment, No. 43, is another backstop.  We are placing an obligation on the Minister to seek the advice of the Commission before drawing up regulations under section 35 on suitable and specific measures.  If he decides to go ahead and ignore the advice of the commission, that will be his prerogative but he will have to give a statement to the Committee on Justice and Equality outlining the reason.  It is just another backstop.<\/p><p>It is a little like amendment No. 5 to section 6, which the select committee passed, in that it provides for greater oversight by the Oireachtas.  It would not impose a significant burden on the Minister to seek the advice of the data protection commission and he may choose not to adopt this advice, provided he informs the joint committee of his reason for not doing so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#V00200","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1685,"content":"<p>Before I invite the Minister to address the group of amendments, will Deputy Daly clarify which amendment or amendments she proposes to withdraw?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#W00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1686,"content":"<p>I am not withdrawing any amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#W00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1687,"content":"<p>I apologise for my mistake.

I will start with the good news, however.  Having regard to the Deputy's contribution and the content of the amendment, I will accept amendment No. 36.  However, I am not in a position to accept the other amendments and I will set out the reasons for my decision.<\/p><p>On section 35, which deals with suitable and specific measures for processing, we are establishing a package or toolbox of suitable and specific measures to be applied in the context of data processing under certain later sections of the Bill.  I strongly advise that we read this section in conjunction with sections 43, 45, 46, 47 and 50 because all of these sections make the use of suitable and specific measures mandatory.  The choice of which measure from the toolbox is to be used will depend on the individual circumstances of the processing.<\/p><p>While I agree with Deputy Daly that this is important, I stress that the safeguards we are discussing are in addition to, and not a substitute for, the technical and organisational measures under the risk-based approach in Article 24 of the GDPR.  These additional measures are justified by the fact that they will apply to special categories of personal data under Article 9.  In some cases, encryption of the personal data concerned might be highly desirable but in other cases the appointment of a data protection officer by the controller might in essence be more effective and practical.In this context, I draw attention to section 35(4), which will permit the specification of compulsory safeguards with respect to certain types of data processing. <\/p><p>I cannot accept the amendments proposed by Deputies Daly and Wallace because they would impose a disproportionately heavy or difficult burden on many controllers in circumstances where such burdens would not be necessary.  Amendment No. 38, for example, proposes to make all measures in subsection (2) mandatory in all cases.  This would impose additional and highly disproportionate obligations on, for example, trade unions handling membership data, schools and voluntary organisations handling health data of pupils or members.  In the case of a school, for instance, this could relate to information about allergies to which certain children are susceptible or perhaps religious groups or practices.  Such obligations and duties would be onerous and heavy in circumstances where the ordinary running of the organisation or school may not give rise to any type of disproportionate obligation or mandatory work that might be regarded as excessive. <\/p><p>The amendments, in particular, amendment No. 38, would place a high burden on elected representatives making representations on behalf of constituents, especially where issues arise concerning medical treatment.  Public representatives deal with such matters daily, for example, in respect of the fair deal scheme, on which we make representations and seek information and services on behalf of constituents.  This is part of the routine work we do.  It is important to note, in the context of reading this legislation, that this is much more than a theoretical exercise.  It imposes real and practical obligations which must be enforceable, including on Oireachtas Members and our colleagues on local authorities.  It also extends to clubs, organisations, societies, trade unions, schools and health organisations.  While it is important that there is compliance with the legislation and the GDPR as we enter this new era, it is also important that we do not make matters so burdensome and onerous as to become unworkable.  This is a difficulty with amendment No. 38.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 37 is largely based on subsection (1) of section 35 but it incorporates provisions from Article 32(1)(<i>b<\/i>)(<i>c<\/i>) and (<i>d<\/i>) of the GDPR, which are already applicable.  It is not necessary to go further because this article of the GDPR is clear and is being transposed.  <\/p><p>Similarly, amendment No. 43 seeks to impose a heavy procedure in respect of any regulations made under the section.  If I understand Deputy Daly correctly, it seeks to impose an obligation on the data protection commission to provide advice in response to every consultation and an obligation on Ministers to inform the relevant Oireachtas committee in cases where the advice is not followed.  I remind members of Article 57 of the GDPR, which allows the data protection commission to inform Oireachtas committees directly of any concerns it may have following consultations on proposed amendments.  This will enable the relevant committee to monitor any regulations made subsequently.  This approach is much more practical and also carries the import of which Deputy Daly spoke.<\/p><p>I do not want a circumstance to arise in which we or bodies across society are faced with a heavy procedure and onerous and burdensome obligations.  Section 35, as it stands, establishes an appropriate and balanced package of measures.  It sets out a mechanism where specific measures are made mandatory in certain cases.  On balance, it is proportionate and deals with circumstances satisfactorily.  It is against this background and the need for balance between protection and safeguards, on the one hand, and obligations, on the other, that I am unwilling to accept the amendments, other than amendment No. 36.  My amendment No. 44 proposes to delete subsection (7) from the section. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#W00900","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1693,"content":"<p>Like the Minister, I will start with the easy part by agreeing with his decision to accept amendment No. 36.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 37 proposes to delete paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) from section 35(1).  However, it would simply move them to section 35(2).  Amendment No. 38 which would insert the three paragraphs dealing with limitations and access to personal data, strict time limits and specific targeted training proposes a new section.  However, it would be mandatory and no longer discretionary.<\/p><p> The legislation is torturous and will torture people throughout the country.  It will set up an industry for individuals who will call themselves data protection officers.  They will become the supremos in their organisations.  I regret that I am certain that it will become a lawyer's holiday.  The Bill is complicated and virtually impenetrable in parts and has us stuck in a committee room for 3 hours and 40 minutes.  Members of the public have to be able to navigate legislation.  Legislation has to be comprehensible to them, but this is not.  I acknowledge Deputy Clare Daly's intention, but my concern is that the amendment would worsen the torture by providing for even more requirements under the legislation.  If we always had large data controllers who were controlling the data of individuals and there was a divergence in power between large data controllers and the individual, I would support all of these measures, but we must recognise that small numbers of individuals who come together will also be data controllers and we are imposing huge obligations on them.  It is not the case that we are dealing with Facebook and a couple of individuals whose rights we want to protect; we are dealing with small groups of people who come together to process data and they will have to read the legislation and understand it.  The Minister mentioned trade unions.  I was concerned about the impenetrability of the Bill before we commenced and while I acknowledge that Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace are well intentioned in their amendments, we need to simplify the legislation.  It is not the case that there is a big, bad data controller on one side and the individual on the other.  Most individuals will be unfortunate enough to find themselves in a scenario where they are also data controllers or data processors.

The legislation is torturous and complex not only for the committee but also will be for all organisations in society from now on.  That is the reality with which we are dealing.  The GDPR is being incorporated into domestic law, but the legislation does not implement it.  Even if we did nothing, the GDPR would come into effect on 25 May.  It is directly applicable and will supersede Irish law.  We are dealing with exemptions, derogations and so on under this legislation.  Much of the criticism of the Government has resulted from it trying to exempt itself from provisions and leaving the State open to litigation in other areas.  Some of the measures we have proposed are intended to avoid that happening.  It is complex and a mess.  The addition of Part 5 which is essentially a different Bill in the middle of the legislation does not help either, but that is not the fault of the amendments.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is accepting amendment No. 36.  Amendment No. 37 provides for a model similar to the German model.  Mandating organisations to test their safeguarding measures regularly and keep their security systems up to date would not be onerous.  A Minister could do it by regulation.  It would hardly be a big deal, as it happens in other areas.  However, we can revisit the issue.  Perhaps it is the lateness of the hour and the complexity of the issues involved, but I was not fully clear on some of the points the Minister made in that regard.  It is a mandatory element, but we will revisit the matter on Report Stage.  We will withdraw amendments Nos. 38 and 42 on that basis, but with regard to amendment No. 43, I do not see what the problem would be in obliging the Minister to seek the advice of the commission before he drew up the regulations.  He would not have to listen to commission officials, but if he did not, he should inform the D&aacute;il as to why not.  That provision would not be onerous and should be inserted.

The difficulty lies in trying to be reasonable in the treatment of small organisations that are trying to do a great deal on limited resources, while ensuring all organisations, big and small, are careful with data and ensure there are no breaches.

We might agree with Sinn F&eacute;in in opposing the entire section but for starters, I will set out the position on our amendments.<\/p><p>The section seems to give far too much scope to third party data processing for non-statutory schemes, especially given that the section describes a situation whereby the consent of the data subject will be bypassed.  I do not believe it would be too burdensome to simply require the relevant third parties working on non-statutory projects to obtain consent to process personal data.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 46 represents a small change but it could be an important one.  Under section 37, as currently worded, it seems that the processing of personal data in the public interest would be possible without being specified in regulations made by the Minister.  Who then would decide what constitutes the public interest?  Who gets to process data in the public interest?  Our amendment seeks to make processing in the public interest explicitly dependent on regulations.  In other words, ministerial regulations should be mandatory for such data processing.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 47 is the same as amendment No. 43, which we discussed earlier.  Amendment No. 48 attempts to introduce some more detail of Article 23 of the general data protection regulation into the Bill.  Article 23 details the restrictions member states can impose on the rights of data subjects for various reasons.  These could include reasons of national security.  Article 23(2) lists specific provisions that any legislative measure referred to in Article 23(1) shall contain, where relevant.  Our amendment is designed to introduce more of these specific provisions into the Bill.  It includes a reference to how storage periods for data should be specified in any regulations introduced.  Moreover, limitations should be specified as to the purpose of data processing.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 49 represents an attempt to introduce an extra layer of protection that we believe is necessary given the wide-ranging powers conferred on Ministers by section.  The lines are taken from elsewhere in the Bill, including section 48, which borrows heavily from the GDPR wording.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Y02300","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1729,"content":"<p>I will try to be as brief as possible.  There are groupings and mini-groupings.  I am open to supporting the Sinn F&eacute;in opposition to the section in its entirety.<\/p><p>We are trying to go for a middle road or whatever.  At the moment, the Bill proposes that the processing of personal data shall be lawful if it is necessary and proportionate and for it to be done by or on behalf of a controller in order to administer any non-statutory scheme once the legal basis for the administration of that scheme is a function conferred by law on the controller who wants to do the processing.  To break that down, it means that because the processing can be done on behalf of a controller - let us call him or her controller A - as long as he or she has a function conferred in law then somebody else - let us call him or her processor B - can process data on his or her behalf without any of the restrictions in the GDPR.  It is a significant issue.<\/p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland, for example, has a statutory function.  It could come up with an online marketing campaign for the Wild Atlantic Way to collect emails, place banner and target ads on social media and so on.  The marketing company concerned would be administering a non-statutory scheme on behalf of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in its statutory function.  This is giving such a marketing scheme a wide exemption from consent and the other obligations in data protection which the GDPR is about.  Not only is it far too wide and includes large numbers of organisations, it is also unfair on a marketing company which is not working for the statutory organisation which has to comply with onerous data protection guidelines, as appropriate, given its importance.  This is an important issue.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 46 is about trying to limit the circumstances in which the exemptions the Government wants to provide under this section can apply.  We think it is clear that the GDPR envisages that in circumstances where point E of the regulation applies, which determines more precisely the specific requirements for processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing is being relied on, member states will adopt the rules of the GDPR via specific and precise requirements which cover processing where this data is being relied upon.  The exemption is wide and vague.  There is no guarantee that any Minister would pass regulations specifying any rules or limitations and so on.  If the Government wants to give very broad powers to State and non-State bodies for them to not have to abide by the data protection rules that everybody else has to abide by, which is what we are discussing, then the Government has to set out the limits of those powers.  It cannot be left to the vagueness of section 37.  At an absolute minimum, therefore, a requirement for Ministers to set out more precisely the ways and means by which personal data can be processed under the public interest official authority exemptions is reasonable.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 47 is like amendment No. 43, in that it asks that the Minister would seek the advice of the commission before drawing up regulations.  Again, that is not a significant burden and is in line with the amendments passed earlier.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 48 in this group states that regulations created under section 37 must specify a few things as the Bill stands.  Section 37 deals with regulations to allow statutory and, in some instances, non-statutory bodies to be exempt from the rules of GDPR in processing personal data.  This is not insignificant.  We propose to add a number of things to the list of regulations in the section which the section has to specify.  They include how long the data can be kept, what it can be used for and the kinds of processing operations and procedures they can undergo.  The additional things we have specified are taken from Article 6 and Recital 45 of the GDPR, which is why we chose them.  We feel that is important and in line with the GDPR.  <\/p><p> As Deputy Wallace said, the wording for amendment No. 49 has been lifted straight from section 48 which deals with the special categories of data, that is, the most sensitive, and given that fact the protections under this section should be in line with that because section 37 is too vague as it stands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Y02400","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1731,"content":"<p>The difficulties with the section have been well outlined.

I would be of the view that if we are going to try to have such a detailed piece of legislation it is probably likely to be the case that the legislation need not be as detailed and the GDPR be allowed to have direct effect in many respects.  If we are, then the wording should reflect fairly exactly what is in the GDPR.  As far as I am concerned, the purposes which are outlined in section 37 are fairly well covered, in particular anything related to the public interest in Articles 6 and 9 of the GDPR.  It would be as well to allow them to have direct effect, but where we are trying to mimic them the analogous wording should be used.  I am concerned that, as far as I am aware, there is no provision for non-statutory schemes or anything like that in the GDPR.  That is a particularly problematic and questionable provision which could be the basis for litigation.<\/p> <p>  In a general sense, my view is that the section is not necessary.

It is appropriate that there is a statutory scheme which deals with the processing of data which is being carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority.  I will not support the amendment which seeks to delete paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of that section.  One of the consequences of the proliferation of the Internet is the undermining of expertise and, to a certain extent, official authority.  The State should try to achieve the objective of trying to do good by the citizen even if it does not always do so.  It should try to ensure that issues such as the health of citizens and crimes against citizens are dealt with properly and adequately.  We should be open to allowing a statutory provision which recognises that work can be carried out in the public interest.  The performance of a function conferred by a person under a statute is a performance of a function which is passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas comprising the elected Members of the people and it should be protected and recognised that is intended to be for the public good.<\/p> <p>  In respect of any non-statutory schemes, it is frequently the case that the Government will introduce a non-statutory scheme which will have the support of the elected Members.  That is deserving of protection.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the comments of the Minister in respect of amendment No. 46.  If one is going to process personal data for the purpose of the public interest or the exercise of official authority, one should probably do so by way of a regulation.  I am interested in hearing whether the Minister is prepared to go for the mandatory requirement, as opposed to the discretionary requirement which is in place at present.  I will support amendment No. 47 since it is identical to one we supported previously.  Amendments Nos. 48 and 49 introduce further provisions which are not necessary for the purposes of what the section is about, namely, allowing the processing of data when it is in the public interest and being done for official authority.  It is not the case that official authority is always bad.  It is there primarily to protect citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Z00300","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1733,"content":"<p>I will not accept the amendments.  The retention of section 37 is not only desirable but it is, to my mind, essential.  I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for his support in that regard.  This is an area which was the subject matter of some debate in the Seanad.<\/p><p>For the same reasons as then, I am not in a position to accept the amendments now.  The purpose of section 37 is to underpin data processing carried out under Article 6.1.  Article 6.3 provides that the basis for the processing referred to in Article 6.1 should be laid down either in EU law or national law and, in the case of paragraph (e), shall be necessary for the performance of the task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority that may from time to time be vested in the controller.<\/p><p> Unlike in some member states, Acts of the Oireachtas that confer functions on public authorities and bodies do not normally provide specifically for the processing of personal data for the purposes of the discharge of their statutory functions.  This is implicit.  To ensure legal certainty following the entry into force of the GDPR, section 37(1)(a) provides that the processing of personal data shall be lawful to the extent that such processing is necessary for the performance of a function conferred by an enactment or the Constitution.  I am back to what we said earlier, about ensuring that the practical outcome of this legislation will not give rise to serious issues from a workability point of view.  What this means here is a statutory function must be conferred on the controller and that the processing shall be lawful to the extent that the processing is necessary and proportionate for the performance of that function.<\/p><p> Section 37(1)(b) deals with data processing that arises where non-statutory schemes, programmes or funds are administered by controllers for the performance of a function conferred by an enactment.  Let me give a couple of examples.  Let us take the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which operates on a non-statutory basis on an ongoing basis, for example, the free fuel scheme, the free travel scheme, the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, and the school meal programme.  All of these schemes necessitate the processing of personal data.  This processing is compliant with the GDPR because Recital 41 states that where the GDPR refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require an Act of Parliament each time.<\/p><p> The practical day-to-day reality of this is such that these schemes and other similar non-statutory measures, such as we had recently with the payment that was made by the State to victims of flooding and, even more recently with the fodder shortage, are all beneficial.  In many respects they are a response of the State to a certain set of circumstances that often require an urgent response.  I would not like to have a body of law or a legal framework where some of these schemes are jeopardised or called into question because of legal uncertainty in respect of data processing, because their continued operation is very much in the public interest.<\/p><p> Subsection (4) allows for the making of regulations to specify the processing of personal data.  It is necessary for the performance of a task to be carried out in the public interest by a controller and it is necessary in the exercise of official authority.  The need for specification arises here because, as recognised in Recital 45 of the GDPR, it is a matter for national law whether the controller is performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another legal person subject to private rather than public law.  The recital recognises that private entities may perform a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, and the purpose of subsection (4) is to ensure transparency as well as legal certainty in such cases.  Subsection (5) specifies the conditions.<\/p><p> I am conscious of the time and I am also conscious of the fact we really did go through this in the Seanad in some detail, but it seems the amendments tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly may well be based on a misunderstanding, because the regulations referred to in subsections (4) and (5) will not create a lawful basis for processing.  That already exists elsewhere.  Rather, for reasons of transparency and legal certainty, they specify processing that is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.<\/p><p> The proposal in amendment No. 48, to add paragraphs (c) to (f), inclusive to subsection 5, in many respects cuts across Article 5 of the GDPR and is not, therefore, GDPR compliant.  Article 5 principles are directly applicable in all cases without the need for any particular specification of this type.  The purpose of the provisions in subsections (2), (3) and (6) is to permit the making of regulations to facilitate the continued operation of the common travel area.  Under SI 220 of 30 March 2016, for example, air and sea carriers are already permitted to process personal data for the purpose of the preservation of the common travel area.  These subsections will permit the making of new regulations to replace those regulations in due course, but this is even more important in the context of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  In short, the retention of section 37 is essential to ensure an element of certainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2018050200002#Z00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":1735,"content":"<p>If it were possible that we could complete this particular section it would be a good cut-off point.

I welcome Mr. Eoghan O'Mara Walsh, chief executive officer, and Mr. Maurice Pratt, chairman, Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC.  Tourism is Ireland's largest indigenous industry, employing 230,000 people, according to Tourism Ireland.  It also provides jobs in parts of the country, rural and urban, with many local communities benefiting from revenue generated by visitors.  However, despite the success of the industry to date, it is important that we continue to develop and invest in our tourism offering.  The ITIC set out a roadmap for the industry's growth in the coming decade and we will now examine it greater detail, identify the key growth areas, potential challenges and what State agencies should do to sustain and expand the industry.<\/p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.

ITIC is the umbrella representative group for tourism business interests.  From airlines and sea carriers to hotels, attractions, restaurants and tour operators, since 1984 ITIC has been making the case for tourism and just last month published a blueprint for the sector's success - Tourism: An Industry Strategy for Growth to 2025, which I am happy to circulate to members.<\/p> <p>  Tourism is Ireland's largest indigenous industry.  It employs 230,000 people throughout the country, which equates to one in every ten jobs, and it is the only industry that can develop long-term sustainable jobs in both urban and rural Ireland.  It is a thriving export sector.  Last year, earnings from overseas visitors topped &euro;4.9 billion as 8.9 million tourists came to our shores.  It is within the prism of tourism as an export sector that ITIC devised its strategy for the sector and with the right policies and investment strategies, the export value of tourism can grow by 65% to more than &euro;8 billion annually by 2025.  That would mean a further 80,000 jobs nationwide and almost &euro;2 billion in returns to the Exchequer in direct tourism-related taxes annually.<\/p> <p>  Some media and political commentators have taken the view that there is no need to develop a strategy for the future when everything is going so well for tourism at the moment.  Our counter-argument is that the time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining.  Tourism has vastly more potential for this country and its regions but, as a sector, it cannot be taken for granted.  The correct strategy must be pursued, supported by State agencies, and, crucially, enabled by Government.<\/p> <p>  The current national policy for tourism &ndash; People, Place and Policy &ndash; was published three years ago by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Administration.  At the time, ITIC felt that the policy lacked ambition and we have been proven right.  The 2025 targets in that policy have nearly been met.  It is now outdated and has been overtaken by both the industry's success and external events such as Brexit.  It is time for a new roadmap and that is what ITIC&rsquo;s strategy aims to achieve.<\/p> <p>  Irish tourism&rsquo;s success has been led largely by the private sector.  In the next three years alone tourism businesses will spend &euro;2.5 billion on new hotels, aircraft, ferries and visitor attractions.  The industry also spent a whopping &euro;92 million in overseas marketing last year.  The State must also play its role in investment.  The Government and previous Government got much right on tourism taxes, particularly the VAT rate and airport passenger duty, APD, but it has been found wanting in investment in both tourism product development and overseas marketing.  State funding for tourism is down 25% or &euro;40 million, since 2008 and Government support for tourism is a vital enabling factor if future success is to be achieved.  This year, the Government has only allocated &euro;113 million in current spending to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  This needs to increase by &euro;50 million to help achieve the goals relating to Exchequer returns, revenue and jobs outlined in our strategy.  Likewise a capital investment analysis shows the State grossly under-investing in tourism.  Only &euro;300 million of the recent &euro;91 billion ten-year national development plan was earmarked for tourism.  As a country we must develop new projects to see and do of scale and international appeal and often the State must be the first mover in this regard.  The shining example of this is the Wild Atlantic Way.<\/p> <p>  Brexit is the big challenge to Irish tourism and is likely to remain to be so in the next few years.  The British market &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s single largest source market for visitors &ndash; is in retreat and this is a very worrying trend.  It has reduced by approximately 5% over the past 12 months.  Crucially, within any new EU-UK deal the common travel area and a soft border must remain in place.  Anything that impedes the free movement of people within the island of Ireland or between Britain and Ireland would be seriously damaging to tourism.  Likewise, a liberalised aviation market and a harmonisation of regulatory standards between post-Brexit UK and Ireland are critical.<\/p> <p>  Tourism: An Industry Strategy for Growth to 2025 is the result of 12 months of extensive consultation and research with the tourism and hospitality industry throughout the country.  There are 56 policy recommendations within the strategy and they act as the considered and informed views of the tourism sector.  This roadmap for tourism&rsquo;s success may be industry-led but it needs to be Government-enabled and agency-supported.  Tourism&rsquo;s role needs to be positioned and defined as a significant economic engine within the national accounts.  In that context ITIC also proposes a national tourism day, the like of which is marked in the USA, Canada and England as well as in the EU and the United Nations, to raise the profile of the industry and celebrate the importance of tourism in Ireland.  Our sector employs one in ten people nationally, contributes billions of euro to the economy in taxation, and impacts positively on communities and cities throughout the country.  There are 20,000 businesses involved in tourism and the sector crucially cannot be outsourced or offshored.  It is high time that Ireland elevated tourism within the national debate and ITIC's strategy identifies clear opportunities as well as challenges for the sector in the coming year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoghan O'Mara Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525249800,"counter":1769,"content":"<p>I endorse Mr. O'Mara Walsh's comments.  This is most extensive review the industry has conducted in 20 years.  It is about positioning ourselves for growth over the next decade.  World tourism growth is between 5% and 6% annually and, therefore, the opportunity is there.  It is about making the right policy choices.  One has to examine industry such as this on the basis of decades as opposed to a short-term basis.  There are many opportunities but the greatest is probably the ability to spread tourism more rurally because it is in every community in the State.  The tourism industry can be brought to parts of the country that other industries would never be able to reach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Pratt"},{"type":"speech","time":1525249800,"counter":1770,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  Tourism hugely benefits the island of Ireland.  The sector has come a long way, changing its dynamic.  I live in Boyle, County Roscommon.  I was heavily involved in ensuring Lough Key Forest Park was developed.  At the time, Coillte owned the park and people were concerned about its future ownership.<\/p><p>In 2001, I advised the local authority that if it took a stake in the park we could draw down the European regional development grants.  The park got &euro;15 million to &euro;16 million and is now a major tourist attraction.  It needs to be added.<\/p><p> However, we have no hotels.  There were two hotels in Boyle previously, but they are closed.  Five hotels were refused planning permission.  Hotels were built all around the country but they are not where we need them.  I had a meeting yesterday as I am trying to get the local authority to examine this.  It is very difficult now to get people in the tourism industry to locate in those areas because we missed out during the boom.  I was also in China last week and met various investors who are considering another hotel.  Is it not ironic that the witnesses are telling us how important and successful the tourism industry is, yet we find it very difficult to get investors from the indigenous tourism sector to invest in places which I believe have huge potential?  Perhaps we are missing something.  Those are only two issues.  I am trying to get the local authority to develop a hotel in Boyle and when I was on the Oireachtas representatives' tour I met Chinese investors to try to get them to invest in a hotel in Roosky, which is already there.  That tells me there is something fundamentally wrong with the industry.<\/p><p> However, we have come a long way.  I believe there are huge opportunities in China.  There are now two direct flights, one from Hong Kong to Dublin and one from Beijing to Dublin.  That was unheard of, and we are in a much better position with regard to exports and tourism.  In addition, there are direct flights from Frankfurt to Knock airport.  People have said there is a noticeable number of German tourists in the west of Ireland because of these flights.  Ryanair and Aer Lingus have helped the industry by bringing people in.  I realise they are bringing people out as well, but it is something we should not underestimate.<\/p><p> The witness said that the Government was not doing enough with regard to investment.  In 2011 a strategic decision was made to reduce VAT to 9%.  It is worth approximately &euro;625 million per year.  Many people, including people in the unions, oppose it.  They believe it is wrong.  I am a little taken aback not by the tone but with regard to this &euro;625 million per year.  If we had not done it the tourism industry would have been much worse off.  I appreciate that the witnesses must fight for extra money in the budget but I wish to make that point.<\/p><p> Finally, the global Irish homecoming and the Wild Atlantic Way have been a huge success.  The challenge is to get tourists out of Dublin.  The witnesses are correct that we are missing out on UK tourists now.  Perhaps they have all been to Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland and are now going somewhere else, but there is a new open market with China as well as the United States.  They are high worth, they are spending and they are coming here.  The Germans and French also travel to the places in the country where we need them such as Carrick-on-Shannon, Boyle, Sligo and so forth.<\/p><p> It has been a very successful seven or eight years.  However, hotel prices, especially in Dublin, can sometimes be off the Richter scale.  That might be due to lack of capacity but that is being addressed.  I was in the Iveagh Garden Hotel on Harcourt Street last night, which has 150 rooms.  We need more hotels.  A hotel in a local town is part of the social infrastructure.  It need not be a huge hotel.  I appeal to people in this regard.  The Government cannot give grant aid because it would distort the market, but there are huge opportunities in smaller towns around the country that do not have a hotel and need one.  Do the witnesses have any views on that or do they have ideas about how politicians or the Government can help would-be hoteliers to develop such hotels?  There are probably only 40 or 50 areas left in the country that do not have that social infrastructure and need it.<\/p><p> Again, I thank the witnesses.  It has been a successful nine or ten years during the most difficult of times.  I know what it is worth because I had a bar and restaurant as well as a newsagents many years ago and we lived off the tourists.  One saw the industry changing.  For ten or 15 years we had fishermen coming to the rivers and lakes but they seemed to disappear.  They were replaced by a different type of tourist.  The challenge is to get the tourists out of the main areas in Dublin.  I was chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and was a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Ironically, the opening of the Titanic centre in Belfast has brought more people from the South to Northern Ireland than probably ever went there in the last 100 years.  It is very welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#C00600","speaker":"1424","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525249800,"counter":1772,"content":"<p>I will respond on a couple of matters before Mr. Pratt responds.  I agree with the vast majority of what the Senator said.  The Titanic centre is a great example of a new tourism product or tourism investment that has driven demand and transformed the city.  I was in Belfast yesterday and the number of new hotels being constructed in Belfast is remarkable.  It is partly because there is a strong draw for Belfast with the Titanic centre.<br\/><br\/>I also agree that a hotel in a town is particularly important from a tourism perspective and even from a social perspective.  My wife's family is from Roscrea in north Tipperary and it is in the same position.  It does not have a hotel and the town misses it.  It has a great castle, Roscrea Castle, which is in the care of the Office of Public Works, OPW, but it lacks that infrastructure.  There is good news on the hotel front.  We do some work with CBRE in terms of it giving us intelligence on what is happening.  There was a period of about ten years when there were no new hotel developments around the country, be it in Dublin or elsewhere.  That was a legacy of the property and financial crash and developers not being in the business any more.  That is changing.  Approximately 6,000 bedrooms are due to be constructed between now and 2022.  They are much needed.  The Senator mentioned hotel prices in Dublin.  That is due to capacity and the fact that demand and supply are out of sync, so we need the additional hotels.  The majority of the 6,000 bedrooms will be in Dublin but approximately 1,000 of them are being constructed outside Dublin.  I do not know about Boyle <i>per se<\/i>, but we need a hotel infrastructure that is equitably spread around the country if we are to get real regional benefits from tourism.<br\/><br\/>The Senator probably knows that the midlands has just been given a new branded identity developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It is something ITIC has been seeking for some time and F&aacute;ilte Ireland has got it over the line.  It is Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, which goes through that area, and that will help to put the midlands in the shop window.  That is important because ultimately private sector investment in hotels and so forth is largely a relation of how much demand there is in particular areas, and demand is fuelled by marketing and branding.<br\/><br\/>I agree there are huge opportunities in China.  One of our big issues, and this refers back to the comment about being enabled by the Government, is that Ireland has very little profile in China.  There is virtually no marketing money in Tourism Ireland, the overseas marketing agency, for countries such as China.  We would argue that the budget cutbacks that were introduced during the austerity years must be reversed.  That would allow Tourism Ireland to market effectively in places such as China, support those routes and achieve the full potential.<br\/><br\/>The current Government and previous Governments have got a great deal right on the tourism taxes.  The VAT rate was the right decision and it has proven successful insofar as tourism has grown significantly since it was introduced.  It puts Ireland in line with the rest of Europe in terms of the tourism VAT rate.  Tourism VAT rates throughout Europe are around 9% or 10%.  Ireland is aligned to that so Ireland is competitive.  It is vital to retain that competitiveness, particularly if the British market is creaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoghan O'Mara Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525249800,"counter":1773,"content":"<p>I agree with most, if not all, of what the Senator said.  I made the point in my opening comment that the great opportunity for Ireland is rural tourism in terms of the spread of tourists.  We must be conscious of the fact that tourism internationally is increasingly urban tourism.<\/p><p>Therefore, a policy is needed to ensure there is no overpopulation of key areas to which tourists naturally want to come.<\/p><p> The point on the importance of hotels as social infrastructure is absolutely correct.  I would like to believe that the &euro;230 million investment being made by Centre Parcs in Longford will help to spread infrastructural development.  The project will be an absolute revelation to people when it arrives.  It will be fantastic for jobs in the area.  That is the sort of investment we need.<\/p><p> We need new product.  Tourism, as an industry and sector, is no different from many other business sectors in that it needs regeneration, new projects, new initiatives and new ideas.  Part of what we call for is the development of stronger tourism attractions in the north west to counterbalance the Cliffs of Moher in the south, for example.  Slieve League is one of the finest attractions in the entire world; it just needs better infrastructure.  We need reasons for people to stay there longer.  That is what develops the whole infrastructure element.<\/p><p> I absolutely take the point on the importance of the decisions the Government made in 2009 at 2010, in more difficult times, to the success that tourism has enjoyed.  It is not unfair to say that tourism has led Ireland's economic recovery.  Decisions on VAT and the airport tax have been quite seminal.  I chaired a mid-term review of the Irish tourism strategy in 2009, at which time there was a call for an even more severe reduction in our investment in tourism, including expenditure on overseas tourism marketing.  As somebody who spent almost his entire life in the brand business, I called at the time for no reduction, if possible.  I referred to equity the State has created in \"Brand Ireland\".  If one reduces one's investment in the market, other markets will take it from one.<\/p><p> The point about the United Kingdom is well made.  There is no question but that Brexit is a threat.  It is partly currency driven thus far but there are other factors.  There is uncertainty for UK tourists now so they are more likely to go on staycations than to go overseas, in the short term at least.  That is a challenge.  The United Kingdom has been our most natural tourism market, for obvious reasons.  We did and do need to rebalance from where we get our tourists.  The progression of tourism has been lumpy and we need to try to flatten it out better.  That is why, looking to the next decade, markets such as Hong Kong, China and the east will be much more important.  They will help to rebalance the lumpiness of tourism.<\/p><p> When one considers very large capital expenditure, the operational side, and significant reductions in one's share of voice in these markets, one notes decisions made now will affect us in two, three and four years.  Our worry about the UK market is such that more money needs to be invested now in marketing Ireland and its attractiveness to British tourists.  I will not say we have taken it for granted but, although it has been such an important market for us, we might be inclined to overlook it because America has been so strong.  Clearly, Aer Lingus, Ryanair and international airlines have been key deliverers of the success we have enjoyed.<\/p><p> We should not forget, however, about how bad things were in 2008, 2009 and 2010.  That is why, as Mr. O'Mara Walsh states in the tourism strategy, we want to see increased State investment.  We agree with much of what is in the long-term capital plan for the period to 2040 but just believe there should be more recognition of the fact that tourism is Ireland's biggest industry.  One would not think that considering some of the other industries that may have a more powerful and cohesive voice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Pratt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525249800,"counter":1775,"content":"<p>I am sorry I was late.  I was watching the proceedings on the monitor in my office so I got the full outline of the opening statement.  I thank both delegates for attending.  I was mentioning to my colleague that it is often forgotten and sometimes ignored that the tourism industry is our largest indigenous industry.  In terms of job creation and wealth generated, tourism surpasses agriculture.  Agriculture is often in the headlines because of the number of jobs and because of how it is perceived.  I am not trying to diminish the role agriculture plays but it is only right and proper that we acknowledge the important role of tourism.<\/p><p>I compliment the confederation on the comprehensive report it published recently.  It is a very positive input to the debate.  The witnesses said in their opening address that the time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining.  That is quite right.  We cannot take it for granted.  The increase in our numbers may be attributable more to luck than design because of the favourable exchange rate with the US dollar.  It is ensuring high visitor numbers from the United States.  That might be compensating for the dramatic decrease in the number of visitors from the United Kingdom.  UK visitors normally account for in excess of 40% of our tourists and 25% of tourist spending.  We cannot ignore it.  I am interested to hear whether the delegates have specific proposals on what we could do to mitigate or reverse the downward trajectory in the number of visitors from the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>Mr. Pratt put it quite well in saying the last Government got it right in terms of taxation.  I refer to the VAT rate and the abolition of the travel tax.  The travel tax was an ill-thought-out proposal made at the height of the crisis.  It should never have been imposed and it was right to get rid of it.  This was proven by the increase in numbers when it was abolished.  Ryanair, in particular, started to utilise Dublin Airport again.<\/p><p>The VAT rate was introduced as a temporary measure and we have to be very careful to try to retain it.  The delegation made the point that the change to the rate is only bringing it into line with that of the rest of our competitors across Europe.  There may now be a feeling that the job is done and that there can be a reversal.  I would say, and the delegation might be able to provide proof, that it might have been self-financing considering the number of jobs created in the tourism industry <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the cost of implementation.  I do not know whether the delegates have any statistics to back that up.<\/p><p>The confederation is correct about new product.  This is why it was also correct to call out the considerable underinvestment in the most recent national development plan.  When one considers how to bring people to a particular area, one must realise they do not go to an area for nothing.  They want to go to an area for a reason.  They want to see something and they want to do something.  The Wild Atlantic Way is such a huge success because there is something to see and do, and it is quite new.  In ten years' time, the Wild Atlantic Way will not be attracting people in the same numbers as it is now because it will be an old product.  We need, therefore, to invest continually.  I do not know whether it is feasible or possible now but the Government needs to review the capital allocation based on the ten-year plan.<\/p><p>With regard to capacity and hotels, the Government might consider increasing the VAT rate when it sees the cost of hotel rooms in Dublin.  It might say the good times are back and that hotels are charging far more than they were charging five and six years ago.  This is predominantly because of a lack of capacity.  I read the delegates' report.  They have very ambitious targets for increasing the number of visitors to Ireland over the next seven or eight years to 2025 but the increase in bed numbers in hotels does not match the targeted increase.  Where is it intended to put all the visitors when they come?  How can we incentivise an acceleration of the building of hotels?<\/p><p>I recently met the president of the Irish Hotels Federation.  He said that to build a hotel room in Ireland costs &euro;300,000 and that to build one in Northern Ireland, 80 miles up the road, costs &euro;200,000.<\/p><p>There is a huge disparity between here and the North.  I welcome the witnesses' views on that.  <\/p><p> My colleague, Senator Feighan, asked how we can attract and retain hotels in rural Ireland.  Only this morning, I received a phone call from Councillor Barbara-Anne Murphy in Wexford in relation to a hotel in Bunclody.  It is being closed and sold to be converted into a nursing home.  That is a planning decision and a commercial decision but the reason for that commercial decision is that money is not being made by that 60-bed hotel.  That is in the sunny south east, which is hardly a black spot for tourism.  I would welcome some feedback on how we might address that.  <\/p><p> I welcome the new development of the Hidden Heartlands.  It is something that, as the witnesses said, they have been promoting and calling for for some time, as have we.  Will it be adequately resourced?  It is one thing creating a brand, but it must be backed up with the necessary resources, whether in marketing or supporting capital investment in the region.  Mr. Pratt rightly pointed out that the biggest and largest capital investment in tourism in the State's history will be coming to my constituency.  It is well under way and on target to open in the middle of next year.  We will benefit from Center Parcs.  I was in Strasbourg some months ago and saw Center Parcs Longford advertised on an international television channel.  It was great to see private industry marketing Ireland but we as a country and the Government need to do more. <\/p><p> I do not know if the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation fed into the Hidden Heartlands.  The Wild Atlantic Way is on the west coast, Ireland's Ancient East is coming in and encroaching in on areas that I would deem more suitable to the Hidden Heartlands.  I would welcome the witnesses thoughts on whether we ought to reconfigure the brands to ensure that geographically each county is in the correct brand and is getting the right marketing proposals to attract tourists.<\/p><p> Witnesses should correct me if I am wrong, but I believe I read that their confederation had called for a review of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's operation?  If that is the case, will they outline their rationale?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#E00200","speaker":"1250","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525249800,"counter":1777,"content":"<p>On whether there is enough investment in the midlands Hidden Heartlands, there is not.  I believe &euro;2 million was initially allocated which will not go a long way for that size of area.  More investment will have to be put in on a long-term basis both in marketing for an international audience and product development.  On the geographic positioning of the Hidden Heartlands, it is only something that we ourselves have seen in recent weeks and are still coming to grips with it.  There does seem to be an area, somewhat like a Venn diagram, where some areas of the country can choose whether to be in Ireland's Ancient East or the Hidden Heartlands.  I think that F&aacute;ilte Ireland's logic is that it is up to the particular tourism product or business as to what they think best fits their profile.  That is work in progress and we will have to keep an eye on it.<\/p> <p>  On product money, I think we all agree that there is not enough investment in capital and infrastructure for tourism.  The &euro;300 million earmarked over the next ten years is all back-loaded with only around &euro;100 million or &euro;120 million for the first four or five years.  We are not in a position to call for a review of the national development plan, which I believe is due in 2022, and hopefully tourism will get a bigger share of the pie then, but in the current allocation we could ask that rather than the sum of money being allocated towards the end of the term, it should be front-loaded which would make a big difference.  Within the strategy developed by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, we have proposed some tourism investment ideas such as a coast-to-coast greenway from Dublin to Galway, an observatory along the Wild Atlantic Way where one can see the dark skies around the edge of Europe and support for the likes of Slieve League and the north west.  There are many product ideas that may not be commercial in their own right and the private sector may not necessarily do them, but the State could move first and then the private sector, hotels, restaurants, attractions and so on, could follow in behind.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Troy on the VAT rate and that the analysis shows that income to the Exchequer from that VAT bracket has doubled since the rate was reduced to 9% because of the growth in tourism numbers.  Regardless of job creation, from a purely Exchequer perspective, the VAT rate has been very successful because of the growth in tourism.  <\/p> <p>  There are 56 recommendations within the strategy and one is that certain areas of F&aacute;ilte Ireland would benefit from a review.  The industry feedback was that there are certain areas of what F&aacute;ilte Ireland does on product development or research or insights that could be improved.  The view in the sector is that a review to help position and strengthen F&aacute;ilte Ireland would be beneficial and would help us achieve the 2025 targets outlined in the strategy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoghan O'Mara Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525249800,"counter":1778,"content":"<p>Deputy Troy is correct that the VAT reduction was set out as a temporary measure.  We are very conscious of that.  We did some research, which we are happy to share with the Deputy on the return to the Exchequer and its benefits.  This strategy highlights the importance of competitiveness in tourism.  VAT is part of that.  The Deputy is correct that hotel rates are also part of the mix within the tourist experience.  Tourists look for good value for money.  If one does not provide it, they can go elsewhere.  In that context, there is the reality of Brexit.  Although it has not happened yet, the currency decline has made Britain more competitive for European tourists to visit because it is better value for money.  They are factors that must be taken on board by the industry.<\/p> <p>  The question of hotel bedrooms is one of supply and demand.  There is a significant amount of supply coming on stream.  It has not come as fast as we would like to rebalance competitiveness but it is happening.  The report refers to the need for 11,000 new hotel rooms nationwide between now and 2025.  Knowing how long hotel developments can take in the planning process, it is possible that all those extra rooms will not come on board in that time.  Hopefully they will but there is a seven year timeframe, and if we start planning now there is a better chance of delivering those numbers.  <\/p> <p>  The OPW has fantastic assets which are very well deployed for tourists but we think that there is an opportunity for more collaboration with the OPW in areas such as the extension of trading hours for those sites.  A tourist to Ireland might come for a week, and for example, Sunday will be one seventh of their total time here.  Opening hours - and this also applies to some areas of the private sector - are not always what a tourist would want and expect.  These are the types of things where we believe we can and should do better.  <\/p> <p>  I think the Hidden Heartlands is a good start and a good brand.  As always the case with new brands, there will be some growing pains.  Crucially, it will come down to two things, namely F&aacute;ilte Ireland having sufficient investment to put behind the brand and private industry having sufficient confidence in the development of that brand to invest in new tourist product.  We have seen quite a lot of this already with ambitious plans for greenways across the country, for example, and the use of the natural resource of the Shannon on both sides.<\/p><p>I think everything else has been picked up.  There was a question on whether we had any specific proposals to make on the UK market and so forth.  That largely revolves around the need for more marketing investment.  We look at where we sit in respect of the share of voice versus key competitive markets like Scotland.  We are competing with it for tourists from England.  When we add in the competitive issue and the fact that Scotland has increased its investment in marketing, we are simply not getting the same share of mind with potential holidaymakers.  That is the key point in the short term.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Pratt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525249800,"counter":1780,"content":"<p>I will use an example of a hotel closing down in Bunclody.

It will be a big talking point again come the autumn.  Everybody acknowledges that Dublin is booming.  Hotel beds are at a premium there.

The development of the regional brand experiences has been positive.  The \"Wild Atlantic Way\" was the inaugural one and is still the best template.  It covers something like nine counties - there are 18 in \"Ireland's Ancient East I think, we can look at a map later -  in and around the western seaboard.  Those nine counties have coalesced behind an umbrella brand.  From an international tourist perspective, a French person, an American or whomever does not differentiate between Wicklow and Wexford.  Instead, they need an overarching umbrella brand identity.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has led the way on this and has done particularly good work on it.  Recently, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the local authorities.  The local authorities will market their region under the brand umbrella.  Local authority investment in tourism is better spent on product, on creating new things to see and do of scale and international appeal within their particular county.  That will be beneficial in the future.<\/p> <p>  We have 56 recommendations in total.  We plan to return to the strategy every six months or so and review how it is progressing.

In fact, in the strategy we have identified that there is a 34:1 return.  Every euro spent on tourism gives &euro;34 back to the Exchequer in direct tourism related taxes.

Already, Ireland is more expensive to the British consumer, therefore, the idea of adding tourism taxes to the system would not be sensible in our view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoghan O'Mara Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1525249800,"counter":1797,"content":"<p>In terms of the tourism sector, many hotels and restaurants benefited from the change in the VAT rate.

I am looking at the investment, say, in MetroLink, which is &euro;3 billion.  The investment in the DART expansion will be hugely beneficial to tourists and indeed everybody in the city.  I would have thought that would be very welcome to the witnesses, particularly the capacity to carry millions more people in the city of Dublin.  I respect everything they have said, and it is right and proper that they should say it.  I do not take from anything they said but I would think that in the 2040 development plan, for instance, the designation of Sligo as a growth centre for the north west is hugely important yet the witnesses do not acknowledge that in their commentary.  If we look at the population statistics and the sustainability of people in communities like that, it is hugely important that the north west has been designated.  The witnesses do not mention the many measures in the plan that are good for tourism.  What is their response to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2018050200002#H01300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525249800,"counter":1804,"content":"<p>We may not have done so in the five-minute opening statement and the question and answer session but it is acknowledged within the strategy.

We have been very complimentary about Sligo's status.<\/p> <p>  The reference to the money allocated to tourism is literally the capital development budget that is given to the State agency for tourism, which is only &euro;300 million.  That money is exclusively dedicated to tourism investment and infrastructure.  Our pitch to the national development plan was that that should be something like &euro;600 million rather than the &euro;300 million allocated.

I live in County Louth and I am delighted that Drogheda and Dundalk are mentioned in that plan.  The tourist corridor North and South is hugely beneficial.  There are many good things happening that were worthy of commentary in the witnesses' statement, notwithstanding any criticism they might wish to express.  I say that fairly and objectively.  My point is that this is about working together, as Mr. Pratt said.  From this committee's perspective, it is about the way forward.<\/p> <p>  I very much welcome the witnesses' submission and I hope that, with the consent of the committee, we will have further meetings on tourism.  The Minister is due to announce the greenways investment shortly, which will be hugely beneficial.  I saw mention recently of a possible greenway between Limerick and Dublin and the water infrastructure improvements that may or may not happen.  The tourism industry should be very much pushing for that.  I am not saying the witnesses would not do that.<\/p> <p>  The questions about the Dublin Airport runway and the impact of Brexit are hugely important.  I would hope we will have the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, before this committee.<\/p> <p>  If it is fair, we would like the witnesses to keep us updated on how they believe we can assist them in their objectives but the key point is, as they said, working together.

The witnesses were right to mention the opening hours of OPW facilities.  During the week, someone complained to me that there is no access by car after a certain time to a lovely facility in Oldbridge, County Meath.  It does not make sense that people have to park on the road.
