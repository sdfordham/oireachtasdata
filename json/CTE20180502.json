I will start by acknowledging the important role that Vicky Phelan has played in highlighting a number of major weaknesses in how people have experienced our national cervical screening programme, CervicalCheck.  The Minister has publicly commented on his swift action so far to address these issues.  He has also expressed his gratitude in public to Vicky Phelan, which I will do here again, for her courage in bringing forward these issues.  Without her, we would not have the opportunity to learn the lessons that I am confident we will learn from this circumstance.  Without attempting to set out a comprehensive roll call, she adds her name to a range of other patients to whom we are grateful who had to come forward in similar circumstances to raise issues of public concern, leading to improvements in the system.  Not least of these are Susie Long, Rebecca O'Malley, R&oacute;is&iacute;n and Mark Molly and Shauna Keyes, but there are many others.  Our challenge will be to derive what value and learning we can from Vicky Phelan's experience, which she courageously brought forward, and use them to improve the system.<\/p> <p>  Vicky Phelan was diagnosed with cervical cancer in July 2014 and, sadly, was informed in 2017 that her cancer was incurable.  In 2014, CervicalCheck's clinical audit of Ms Phelan's 2011 smear test result, which was reported at the time as normal, identified a query squamous cell carcinoma.  However, Ms Phelan was not made aware of this finding until September 2017.  This delay has raised serious concerns about the processes for providing information to patients and clinicians.<\/p> <p>  Subsequent to the controversy that arose surrounding her case, the HSE initially advised that, between 2008 and early 2018, 1,482 cervical cancer cases were notified to CervicalCheck.  The majority were women who had already been referred for further investigation or for treatment by CervicalCheck.  As part of the clinical audit process, these notified cases were re-examined and a number were flagged for further cytology review.  In 208 of these cases, the cytology review recommendations differed from the original results.<\/p> <p>  Last Friday, 27 April, the HSE established a serious incident management team, SIMT, to oversee and direct the management of this incident.  The SIMT has reported that approximately 162 of the 208 women involved have now been informed of the outcome of the audit process.  Communication with these women is ongoing.  We have further details, which we would be happy to share with members.  I regret to say that 17 of the 208 patients are deceased.  Like the Minister, we express our sympathies to the families of those patients.<\/p> <p>  Arising from the work of the SIMT, and as outlined by the Minister last night on the floor of the D&aacute;il, the number of cases of cervical cancer notified to CervicalCheck - 1,482 - does not represent all of the cases of cervical cancer occurring in Ireland since the establishment of the programme in September 2008.  I regret to say that I do not at this point have the necessary information to confirm how many additional cases this might represent, but work has started on ascertaining what that number is.  We will detail that work.  The Minister has directed that immediate steps be taken so that information from the national cancer registry on any additional case of cervical cancer that occurred during that period is provided to the CervicalCheck programme.  Any screening history that those additional cases may have - not all will necessarily have been screened - will be established.  If any of these women was screened through the CervicalCheck programme, her case will be reviewed in further detail, with cytology review where necessary.  A helpline has been in operation at the national cancer screening service since Friday and clinical staff are following up with women on their specific clinical questions.<\/p> <p>  Since 2008, some 3 million smears have been carried out by CervicalCheck.  It is important to note that the cervical screening test is not a diagnostic test, only a screening test, that is, a test to indicate the possibility of pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions, thereby identifying women who need to be referred for further investigation or follow-up.  Smear tests can produce false positive and false negative results.<\/p><p>Therefore, cervical cancer may well develop in the time interval between a negative screening test and the next scheduled screening in any cervical screening programme.  The current primary screening test used by CervicalCheck is a cytology test which is known to have low sensitivity, that is, it produces a not insignificant number of false negative results.  Naturally, many women are now concerned about their own health following the publicity surrounding CervicalCheck.  It is certainly our intention, if we may, to use the committee and its indulgence to reassure people about the performance of the programme in relation to those people.  In order to provide assurance, CervicalCheck will make the necessary arrangements to enable any woman who has had a CervicalCheck smear test to have a consultation with her GP, in order to help her determine whether she wishes to have a further test without charge.  These arrangements are currently being worked through and will be confirmed this week.  We will hear further detail of this over the course of the afternoon.<\/p><p> In addition, in February 2018, the Minister approved the introduction of primary HPV screening for cervical smear samples, and I can confirm that this will be introduced later this year.  A Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, health technology assessment has found that HPV screening would benefit women by making the screening process much more clinically effective as well as reducing unnecessary tests, and greatly elongating the interval between tests for individuals.<\/p><p> I would now like to turn to the steps that are being taken to ensure the integrity of the CervicalCheck screening programme.  Non-disclosure of information to affected patients has raised concerns for users within the health service.  Patients have an absolute right to be provided with honest, open and prompt communication about any adverse event that may have caused them harm.  This is underpinned in the medical practitioner's code of conduct and the HSE open disclosure policy.  The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which includes provisions that support open disclosure, became law last year.  These provisions were drafted to create a safe space for professionals to be open and transparent with patients in order that they would be given as much information as possible, as early as possible, including an apology where appropriate.  By doing this, we have taken away any fears that doctors may have in being open and apologising to patients, specifically, fears of creating legal liabilities for themselves.  There is no longer room for excuses.  The patient has a right to know and should be told.<\/p><p> The next step is to further strengthen and protect open and honest communications between patients and the health service by bringing forward proposals for mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable events.  A stand-alone patient safety Bill goes to Government next week to expedite this.  The Minister&rsquo;s intention is to have an independent statutory investigation to examine the CervicalCheck screening programme.  This investigation will have all the necessary powers to investigate the issues highlighted by Ms Phelan and will place particular focus on the quality assurance systems, clinical audit processes and communications with patients within the cervical screening programme.<\/p><p> As part of this, a comprehensive examination of the cervical screening programme in Ireland against international best practice and standards will be undertaken.  The investigation will also identify, within its terms of reference, any implications that may apply to other cancer screening programmes.  In addition to this statutory investigation, we are now working on putting in place, as a matter of urgency, an international clinical expert process to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review.  This panel will also produce an overall report to inform the statutory  investigation and the work of the international peer review group.  We are mindful of the need to provide support to these women and a liaison nurse specialist will co-ordinate the work of the expert group.  We intend to include patient advocates as part of that process also. <\/p><p> Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women aged between 25 and 39 years.  Every year in Ireland approximately 270 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and just under 100 deaths occur from it.  Cervical cells change slowly and take time to develop into cancer cells, making cervical cancer a preventable disease.  Even with the inherent challenges in screening, having regular smear tests can pick up early cell changes or pre-cancerous growths and reduce the risk of cervical cancer.  This is the scientific basis of screening.  I must emphasise how important it is that women continue to have their smears and take this test, which can and will continue to save lives.<\/p><p> It is our intention to take these necessary steps in order to ensure the integrity of the cervical screening programme while at the same time disseminating any learning to all cancer screening programmes.  These programmes are an important component of the progress that we have made over the past ten years in cancer survivorship for people in this country.  The Department is fully committed to the further development of our cancer services and to delivering the ambitious roadmap set out for these services as outlined in the national cancer strategy which was launched last year.  We will be happy to take any questions from the committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting to discuss the current issues surrounding the CervicalCheck Programme.  I am joined today by my colleagues Dr. Colm Henry, recently appointed as the HSE chief clinical officer; Dr. Jerome Coffey, national director of the national cancer control programme; Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director of the national women and infants programme; Ms Angela Fitzgerald, deputy national director of acute services; Mr. John Gleeson, programme manager of CervicalCheck; and Mr. Patrick Lynch, national director for quality assurance and verification and chair of the serious incident management team, SIMT.<\/p> <p>  I would like to begin by reiterating on behalf of the HSE my sincere apologies to all those women who have been affected and families involved in the CervicalCheck controversy, and others who although not directly involved have experienced any distress by what they have heard and read in recent days.  I also wish to state that I did contact Ms Vicky Phelan to apologise to her for the delay in telling her that her test results had been a false negative and I want to sincerely make that apology to her and her family again here today.<\/p> <p>  At the centre of this issue was our failure to communicate to the women that were the subject of the audit.  Those women should have been informed and that is something that will happen from now on.  It is essential that we re-establish confidence in our cervical screening programme, which is a critical public health initiative.<\/p> <p>  CervicalCheck, the HSE&rsquo;s national cervical screening programme, has provided a population-based cervical screening programme to the women of Ireland since 2008.  It is important to be clear and to understand that cervical screening is not a test for cancer, but a means of preventing it.  Cervical screening works by looking for changes in the cells of the cervix, the neck of the womb, using a smear test and cervical cytology.  The earlier abnormal cell changes are found, the easier they are to treat and the treatment of these changes in the cells of the cervix means that the risk of developing cervical cancer is reduced.  Screening is internationally accepted as a preventative health measure.  While it is recognised that no screening test is 100% accurate, cervical screening is the most effective method of reducing a woman&rsquo;s risk of developing cervical cancer.  By achieving and maintaining the targeted coverage rate of 80% as it currently does, CervicalCheck has the potential to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer significantly.<\/p> <p>  Since 2008, women in Ireland have been attending in increasing numbers.  CervicalCheck has achieved an 80% coverage rate among eligible women, a figure that is among the highest in EU countries.  Latest figures from National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, show that the incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland has reduced by around 7% per annum since the period from 2010 to 2015.  This means that fewer women will develop cervical cancer and there will be fewer deaths.<\/p> <p>  To date, CervicalCheck has provided 3 million cervical screenings to more than 1.1 million women.  It has detected more than 50,000 high grade pre-cancerous changes in women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without screening, would not have known they had pre-cancerous changes.  Furthermore the programme has detected more than 35,000 cases of low-grade cell changes and more than 1,200 cancers.<\/p> <p>  There are 15 clinics across the country which provide colposcopy services as part of the CervicalCheck programme.  Continued successful collaboration between the programme and colposcopy clinics nationwide has led to sustained improvements to colposcopy services and eliminated waiting lists.  The high standard of colposcopy has ensured that women who require a colposcopy are guaranteed timely access to a standardised level of quality-assured care.<\/p> <p>  In 2009 CervicalCheck participated in an external international peer review of the CervicalCheck quality assurance, QA, standards.<\/p><p>The international peer review panel consisted of those named on the printed version of the statement and I will not read the list out, subject to the agreement of the committee.  They are, however, a credible international set of experts.  It has been asserted that, in some way, the screening programme in this country is substandard to the US as it is asserted that the US screens every year.  However, the HIQA report of October 2009 on the evaluation of the use of resources in the national population-based cancer screening programmes and associated services presented the recommended screening interval internationally.  In the case of the USA, recommended intervals are initially two smears, one year apart, then every three years.  It is also important to note that much of the US system involves a self-select process, an opt-in which, in effect, is a voluntary presentation and not a calling or invitation system as in Ireland.  It is not an organised programme in that sense.<br\/><br\/>HIQA goes on to say in that 2009 report:<\/p><blockquote>A systematic review of the existing evidence base for the optimal age-range and screening interval for cervical screening was undertaken in order to determine if the current age-range (25-60 years) could be narrowed or the screening intervals increased.  Based on the literature review, the current age range and screening interval adopted in the CervicalCheck programme in Ireland would appear to be consistent with the international evidence base.<\/blockquote><p>The HIQA report also noted that CervicalCheck administration has achieved the ISO 9001-2000 quality certification and maintains this standard through regular internal and external audit.  A comprehensive smear taker training prospectus has also been developed and underpins a smear taking training programme developed and delivered in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, the National University of Ireland Galway, and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.<br\/><br\/>There has been much commentary on the outsourced CervicalCheck laboratory services.  In that regard, I would like to make the following comments.  A procurement process for the provision of cytology laboratory services was undertaken in December 2007 with the publication of a notice in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union <\/i>in line with public procurement regulations.  The requirement of the NCSS was that each potential contractor would need to meet certain criteria, including that they must hold third party accreditation from a recognised accreditation body to international standard ISO 15189; have capacity to screen a minimum of 25,000 cervical smear samples per year; have capacity and ability to process smears within a ten-day turnaround in order to facilitate the delivery of results to women within four weeks of their smear test; and hold independent quality accreditation of the service.<br\/><br\/>On completion of the procurement process, a private sector provider of laboratory services, Quest Diagnostics Inc., was appointed for the provision of cytology laboratory services.  In addition to the criteria above, each slide analysed by the laboratory is examined twice by two separate cytologists.  CervicalCheck, in line with public procurement guidelines, re-tendered for laboratory services in 2009 and again in 2012.  Following the 2009 procurement process, Medlab Pathology Limited was appointed along with the previous incumbent Quest Diagnostics Inc.  In 2012, a further tendering process took place and the two laboratories mentioned above were appointed under a HSE framework agreement.  This framework agreement is still active today and both Quest Diagnostics and Medlab Pathology are still providing cytology and HPV laboratory services, under contract, on behalf of CervicalCheck.<br\/><br\/>I now want to address the findings of the serious incident management team, SIMT, report.  I have submitted the full report, which is also available at <i>hse.ie<\/i>, to the committee with the opening statement so I will highlight some of the key issues here.  Over the past week there has been considerable public focus on, and concern about, the cervical screening service.  Much of this concern stems from an audit of 1,482 cases of cervical cancer reported to the programme in the period between 2008 and 2018.  The CervicalCheck clinical audit process examines the screening history of all notified cases of cervical cancer, with a date of diagnosis since the programme commenced in September 2008.  The cases covered by the audit were those cases of cervical cancer notified to the programme and not the larger number of cases notified to the National Cancer Registry for the same period.  The programme advised Department of Health officials on Friday evening that the figures were based on the cancer registry figures and it was on this basis that the Minister was briefed.  It was subsequently determined by the SIMT that this was incorrect.<br\/><br\/>The audit process is an opportunity to see if any aspect of a programme could be improved.  The process can also provide more detailed information to women on the reasons their cancer was not prevented, as well as information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening.  Of the 1,482 cases notified and logged to date, 442 cases, 29%, were flagged for review of one or more elements of the cervical screening pathway, which includes programme operation, screening, cytopathology and HPV testing, colposcopy or histopathology.  Cases are reviewed by an internal review group, with the support of an independent pathologist.  The most common review type, as expected in a cervical screening programme, is of cytology, that is, the smear test, due to its inherent limitations as a screening test.  Cytology reviews are performed internally by the original reporting laboratory, and by independent laboratories if a further opinion is required.<br\/><br\/>In February 2016, the programme commenced formally communicating review outcomes of historical notified cervical cancer cases where prior cytology had been reviewed to the consultant doctor looking after an individual woman diagnosed with cervical cancer.  All historical reviews were communicated to treating doctors by October 2016 and the programme has been communicating current cases since that date.  While the audit process established by CervicalCheck is seen as good practice and has the potential to make an important contribution to improving the quality of the programme, there was some evidence that the women whose cytology smear test had been reviewed as part of the audit process had not been informed either of the review or the outcome as it pertained to them.  The women whose cases were reviewed already had a diagnosis of cancer so the outcome of the review of their cytology smear test would not have changed their diagnosis or treatment.  They were entitled, however, to know that their case was reviewed and the outcome of that review.  This was particularly important where the review team drew conclusions that were different from the original interpretation of the smear result.<br\/><br\/>The SIMT established that there were 208 women who should have been communicated with in relation to the review process.  These were women where the CervicalCheck review team interpretation of their smear result was different from the original smear interpretation.  Of these, 175 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result and, based on the opinion of the review team, this would have led to a different clinical escalation, namely, a referral for biopsy or colposcopy.  Of the total, 33 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result but, based on the opinion of the review team, they would not have recommended different clinical management other than an earlier repeat smear.<br\/><br\/>On 30 April 2018, following the review of patient charts over the weekend, it was established that of the 208 women concerned, 46 women have already been communicated with and 162 women had not been told.  Each hospital group was then required to ensure that each of the 162 women who had not been told of the review outcome would be phoned on Monday, 30 April and Tuesday, 1 May 2018.  They would be offered an appointment to meet the appropriate senior clinician during the week ending Saturday, 5 May 2018.  There were 17 women in this cohort who have died.  It has been established that two of these women had the results of their review communicated to them before their death.  It is acknowledged that, in addition to a diagnosis of cancer, finding out at this stage that they were the subject of a review will be distressing.  The SIMT is confident that the clinicians meeting with these women or their next of kin will be very sensitive to the context of this information.<\/p><p>While the women who were the primary focus and concern of the work of the SIMT had all received a diagnosis of cancer at the time of their review and the review would not have changed the outcome, they were all entitled to know the review had been conducted and its outcome as it related to them.  This openness and transparency should lie at the heart of a caring and compassionate health care system.  Many women may be worried because of the recent coverage, and there is useful information available on .<br\/><br\/><b><i><\/i><\/b>During the course of its work, it became evident to the SIMT that the number of cases audited by the screening programme varied from the number of cases of cervical cancer reported to the National Cancer Registry over the same period.  The SIMT immediately took action, escalating this matter to me.  This, as the chief medical officer has already referenced, will result in the National Cancer Registry being mandated to share its data with the programme, the lists being reconciled, and an immediate audit of these remaining cases being undertaken.<br\/><br\/>I would like to conclude by saying that I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he is establishing a statutory investigation, which will be carried out by HIQA.  I also welcome the appointment of an international clinical expert panel to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review.  The HSE will fully co-operate with both processes to ensure we establish all of the facts surrounding what has occurred and, above all, so we can learn from what has happened and ensure it does not occur again.<br\/><br\/>Given that I started my career in the public service in BreastCheck, the recent events are indeed a personal blow to me.  I do not have many more weeks in my role.  Indeed, I have only a few months because, as members know, I announced some time ago I would not be remaining beyond the term of my current contract, and consequently I intend to devote the greater part of those weeks to addressing these issues.  In that regard, as I believe the Taoiseach confirmed earlier, I have appointed Mr. Damien McCallion, one of our senior national directors, currently responsible for emergency management, among other duties, to take charge of the national cancer screening service from tomorrow so all the issues that need to be worked through as we deal with this can be managed by him.  He will report directly to me.  I will be taking a very close personal interest in every aspect of this process.  The SIMT will continue its work also.<br\/><br\/>That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#LL00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien.  As this may be a prolonged meeting, witnesses and members may take a break after two hours, if they wish.  It is very important for the members and witnesses to note that the women at the centre of this controversy should remain our main focus.  The setting up of an inquiry that will seek the truth on this issue should concern us.  We should concentrate on that and not take political issues into account.  The issues that arise this evening relate to trust.  There has been a breakdown of trust.  There has been a loss of trust in the CervicalCheck programme.  There have been a breakdown in and failure of open disclosure.  There has been a destruction of confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.  That needs to be restored as quickly as possible.  Full disclosure might not have affected treatment but it certainly would have altered women's ability to respond to the information.  It might have afforded an opportunity to seek redress elsewhere, as Ms Vicky Phelan did.  Therefore, non-disclosure had a significant effect.  It raises issues regarding governance, accountability and the cultural change required in the HSE and the Department.<\/p> <p>  I have three questions to start the meeting.  The first is for Mr. John Gleeson.  How could open disclosure not be part of the CervicalCheck programme?  It seems quite difficult to understand.  The cervical cancer registry and the CervicalCheck database did not match.  How could that possibly be and how could there have been such a breakdown in communication?  My third question is for Mr. O'Brien.  Is it now possible to say we know all the information in regard to this issue?  Have we identified each person who requires a smear case audit but who has not had one thus far?  Has the total number of patients been identified?  Perhaps these questions could be addressed first.<\/p> <p>  Members will have ten minutes each for questions and answers.  Witnesses are advised to keep their answers as concise as possible, just as I hope members will keep their questions as concise as possible, to allow every member to engage.  Perhaps Mr. Gleeson might address the two questions addressed to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#NN00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>On the Chairman's first question, on open disclosure, we started the process of cancer audit in 2010 with a view to ensuring quality assurance and continual improvement and through 2014 decided to review it and then commence, in line with the published HSE open disclosure policy of 2013, an evaluation of what that meant in screening terms, mostly in terms of defining serious incidents.  It did not make specific reference to screening, which is different.  One is dealing with people who do not have symptoms.  It is not like people in hospitals; it is a different cohort of the population.  Without trying to not do open disclosure, we went about trying to figure out how best to do it in respect of women we were concerned about because, after all, they had been diagnosed with cervical cancer.  We were looking at something before that point in time and how to communicate it but we did develop the process.  It took a considerable amount of time, for which I apologise, but the intent was always to let the women know.  We looked to practices in England and elsewhere to determine how that might best be done.  It was always felt that the treating clinician of the woman at that time was the best channel through which to communicate with her.

That is just by way of comment.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. O'Brien.  He stated at the press conference that he found out about what he describes as a failure to communicate - and perhaps he might want to revisit that description of what we are discussing today -  in the media.  I am interested in trying to get to the bottom of this.  A circular issued in 2016 is at the heart of the failure to communicate, as Mr. O'Brien describes it.  It advised clinicians simply to add a copy of the audit to the file and use their clinical judgment on whether to tell a woman something about her own health and, in a case where the poor unfortunate patient had died, to stick a note on the file.  When that circular was being drafted, and I understand it was signed by someone who was a member of the senior management team, senior clinicians and senior people in the HSE presumably were involved in drafting a circular of this nature.  It stretches credibility a bit for me that these people, members of Mr. O'Brien's senior team, would not have communicated to him on an issue as serious as this.  If we want to talk about open disclosure and being full and frank, I hope we can get away from what we have had in recent days, which is an endless round of people - mostly men as it goes and no disrespect intended to men - describing to women what it is like to have a smear test and how important it is.  I do not need any of that advice.  I have been having smear tests for 22 years, since I had my daughter.  I understand how important it is.  I also know it is not a diagnostic test and I understand it is a screening test.  It would probably be helpful if we could dispense with having to repeat that.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Brien give me some information as to who would have been involved in compiling that circular, because to me it seems that it came from a very senior level?  It strikes me as odd that it did not come across Mr. O'Brien's desk, but he is telling us the first he knew about it was in the media.

Mr. O'Brien outlined the procurement procedure involved and stated that serious concerns were raised in various quarters.  It would seem obvious to me that if domestic concerns had been expressed about the process then two years into it Mr. O'Brien, as the person in charge, should have reviewed the outcomes.  Perhaps I missed something in the opening statement.  Under the heading, the procurement of cytology laboratory services, in his opening statement he referred to capacity of a laboratory and the turnaround time.

I know that much has been said on the issue of public confidence.  I am not suggesting in any sense that the Deputy is taking us back in comparison, but it is worth pointing out that before the programme was established in 2008 - and this is a ballpark figure - we were doing somewhere in the region of 300,000 smears a year.  We were sending the smear tests to small laboratories, where we were getting poor quality assurance, QA and we had no QA to tell us what the performance was.  Some of the women being screened were being screened far too frequently and others were not being screened at all.  We were having no impact on mortality.  I can remember testimony by clinicians, particularly from those who came back to work in this country around that time about the late stage of presentation of young women with young children with cervical cancer.  That situation has not changed completely, but it is changing substantially.  We have had since 2010 a substantial reduction in the mortality associated with the programme and a range of other factors that allow us to say that people are being identified.  <br\/><br\/>We heard earlier about the 50,000 or so women who have been identified with early stage changes that could be dealt with definitively.  If we continue with the performance parameters that we are seeing with our programme, we can be confident that we will continue to drive down that mortality.  When we supplement that with what we are doing in terms of HPV screening, which will start later year, we can be confident in the screening performance of that.  We have substantial reason to continue to express high confidence as leaders in the health care system.  All of our health care practitioners should be in a position to continue on the basis of the data that we have available to us.  I can make available to the committee an article that was published in the <i>European Journal of Cancer Care<\/i>about three years ago, based on a side by side comparison, questionnaire based.  This analysis of cervical cancer screening programmes around Europe confirmed that we have one of the most organised, highest performing and most quality assured programmes anywhere in Europe.  Many of the features we are talking about here today are exhibited by very few organised programmes.  Many well-known countries, First World countries as it were, do not have that type of organised programmes.  The basis for us to continue to reassure people that they can have confidence in the programme, confidence in the results of their tests on the basis of its performance remains.  That has not been changed by any of the unfortunate experiences that some of the people of whom we have talked about have had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#TT01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The issue is public confidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#TT01600","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>That is exactly what I am trying to address; the public can have that confidence in the performance of the programme and in the test results that they are getting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#TT01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Coffey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#TT01800","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I wish to make one brief comment in response to the question on public confidence.

Was legal advice sought by either the HSE or CervicalCheck, on that?<\/p> <p>  The second question I have relates to when the first legal letter came in on this matter and who it came to.  There would have been an exchange of legal correspondence before proceedings started.  Who did it come in to and why did that not set off alarm bells at that stage about notifying the other people who were involved?  Why has it been the case that we have had to wait for it to go all of the way to court before we have now decided to notify all of the other people involved?  Can these matters be clarified?

There is going to be huge increase in the number of people looking for repeat smears.  What system has been set up to deal with the increased volume of repeat smears that are going to be taken and analysed?  Has any process been looked at at this stage in relation to that area as regards ensuring that, if there is an increase in volume, that they can be dealt with in an expeditious manner?<\/p> <p>  Finally, my understanding is that there are 15 clinics.  Some of those clinics had raised concerns with the people directly at the top of the organisation over the last number of years.  Can it be clarified whether there were regular meetings with the principal people involved in these 15 clinics, or was it all by email and by telephone?  I have received information to the effect that some people in the clinics based around the country had expressed concerns about issues as they arose but found that their concerns were not being taken on board.  Was there a mechanism where regular meetings occurred on an overall basis between the 15 clinics and the people who were in charge of the entire programme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#UU02100","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":244,"content":"<p>First, I will deal with the questions in sequence, I will then hand over to Mr. Gleeson for certain points.<\/p> <p>  The first point about disclosure which is critical and central here, a decision not to share is the reverse of my reading of the process in this situation.  There was a clinical audit ongoing.  There was a very protracted discussion both nationally and internationally about models of disclosure, concerning how and when to disclose.  That is where the debate was; it was not designed not to disclose.<\/p> <p>  What has evolved, apart from the reference earlier to the information being sent to the clinicians, was a patient information leaflet for patients telling them, where appropriate, that a review had taken place, and a very simple mechanism to trigger an appointment with a clinician to discuss all elements of the review.  <\/p> <p>  The second point I will leave to Mr. Gleeson, regarding the current case and when correspondence started.<\/p><p> The third point is that we anticipate an increased volume of smears, but it is very hard to quantify.  Our actions this morning were to make sure there was the capacity, where clinically appropriate, to enable women to have smears without delay.  That is open-ended.  We do not know how long the interest and anxiety will last for, but we are prepared to keep the enhanced resourcing until everybody has had their questions answered to their satisfaction and, where appropriate, additional smears will be taken.  That process will continue for as long as it takes.<\/p><p> The final point was about correspondence and colposcopy clinics.

That is kind of what brings us to where we are now.  As Dr. McKenna has outlined, even <i>in extremis<\/i>based on the estimates we have heard and even if all of the cases were missed opportunities for diagnosis, they fall, in total, within the parameters of a successful screening programme because screening programmes are not 100% effective.  The benefit of this screening programme is that 50,000 women have had a diagnosis of high-grade cell changes resulting in early treatment, resulting in their being able to avoid developing cancer.  Consequently, the numbers of cancers have fallen and the number of deaths has fallen.  These are really important health benefits in respect of which we must collectively try to do our best not to lose because it would be to the detriment of everyone if the trend went backwards.  In addition to putting matters to right for the women who were not given the information they should have been given, one of our greatest focuses and one that has been our immediate priority is restoring public confidence.  Without it, we will pay a huge public health price.  That is why I am focusing on this now to the extent that I am and why I have taken the steps with the movement of Mr. Damien McCallion to take personal charge of the national cancer screening service.<br\/><br\/>I ask Mr. Patrick Lynch to speak about how alarm bells should be treated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#WW00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":268,"content":"<p>A range of things happen anywhere in the health service on any given day.

That is because this form of testing is internationally understood to be 70% accurate.  It is a screening test and not a diagnostic test.  It was always inevitable that the screening programme, as with all population screening programmes, would not provide a pathway to diagnosis for every woman who might have been able to benefit from it.  At the outset, based on all the public health information available, and in any country that has decided to have a screening programme for any population-based cancer, the decision is made to have the screening programme based on the benefit it can deliver as opposed to the benefits it will not deliver.  That benefit, as I characterised earlier, is a 7% reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  The detection of high-grade cervical cell abnormalities among 50,000 patients, enabling them to have treatment, means they will not go on to develop cervical cancer.

I wish to ask about the claim Mr. O'Brien has just made to the effect that 70% is the average accuracy of the test.  That is not the figure that was cited on the D&aacute;il record in 2008.

Why is the accuracy so low when, in 2008, Irish labs had a 95% accuracy rate, according to Senator James Reilly, who went on to become Minister for Health and who is a doctor.  I assume he was not telling a lie.  Why would we move to a system that, according to other experts at the time, had an 85% accuracy rate?  I refer to the US system.  I am not just blaming the witnesses.  These were political decisions that were taken.  The witnesses are managers.  I put it to them that this was testing on the cheap.  At the time, Mr. O'Brien, in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>published on 9 May 2008, said he was satisfied Quest Diagnostics could provide the required quality of testing.  However, the emphasis in his opening statement today seemed to be on getting 25,000 smear samples done a year with a high turnaround to get the results back in people's hands by a certain amount of time.

Dr. Gibbons and other scientists subsequently resigned because their concerns were ignored and dismissed.  When that was put to Mr. O'Brien, he said that he had addressed those concerns in the final contract before it was awarded to Quest Diagnostics.  Will the witness describe how he addressed those concerns?  What was written into the contract?  If Mr. O'Brien was prepared to address those concerns, why was that not indicated to the scientists at the time, instead of forcing their resignation?<\/p> <p>  He subsequently said he was happy with the standards applied by Quest Diagnostics.  Mr. O'Brien must have been happy with the standards applied by CPL in Austin, Texas, as well, because he awarded it the contract.  However, CPL is the company that was successfully sued by Ms Vicky Phelan.  It settled with her for &euro;2.5 million.  Why would the company have settled with her if there was not a difficulty?  I would like a brief answer. <\/p> <p>  I have read the press release from the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine on cervical screening.  It has called on the Minister for Health to publish the results of the 2014 audit.  When I asked the Minister in the D&aacute;il last night to do that, he said there were no results of the audit - there were just individual reports for individual women.  I spoke to a friend of mine who is a scientist about this today.  She said that would be extraordinary because every audit has to have at least an introduction, the basis on which the audit was carried out, why it was carried out, what triggered it and what the terms of reference were.  That is the very least.  An audit will not just have Margaret's results, Ruth's results and Br&iacute;d's results and a description of how they have been looked at.  There has to be a description and a report back.  We are looking for that to be published.  I echo the call by the academy for the 2014 audit to be published.  I would like Mr. O'Brien to comment.  <\/p> <p>  When the State Claims Agency, and I think it was Mr. Gleeson, was alerted that there was a claim made by Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. O'Brien said he did not know anything about it until last Friday.  I do not believe him.  I do not believe that the Minister did not know.  Other people might believe Mr. O'Brien but I doubt it.  I think there are thousands of people out there who do not believe Mr. O'Brien.  There may not be a paper trail or a smoking gun, an email or anything else but there could have been a conversation.  Did Mr. Gleeson keep this to himself as a secret or did he discuss it verbally with anybody else?  Would Mr. Gleeson get information like that, in a position of responsibility, and keep it all to himself?  If Mr. O'Brien, as the head of the HSE, did not know until last Friday, he must be hopping mad.  He must be looking for heads to roll over this.  If he is not, I wonder why.  I think anybody else would.  I have one more quick question. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#YY01000","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>The Deputy is eating into the time for the answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#YY01100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I know.

There are many different statistics that appear to be in conflict with each other but they are not.  When we talk about sensitivity and specificity of a test, it means a different thing when we talk about false positive and false negative.  They are technically different things.  It is a different thing again in terms of a yield and how likely it is, and how positive one can be that the result that is negative is in fact negative.  They are different measures and they are being used interchangeably.<\/p> <p>  It is important we are given time to be able to set this out for the committee in a way it can understand.  I am not suggesting Deputy O'Reilly is doing this, but the way in which various statistics are being used is creating an impression that there is a conflict that is not in fact there.  If I can give an example, and I am not going to quote in terms of the screening programme and its figures because we can calculate those figures off the performance of our own programme, but if we are talking about something that is 80% sensitive this means there is an 80% chance that if a disease is there a test will find it, and there is a 20% chance that if the disease is there it will not find it.  This is what the 80% means.<\/p> <p>  Whether or not we can rely on the test being negative when we get a negative result depends not only on the sensitivity but also on the incidence of the disease in the background population.  I appreciate this is a technical epidemiological point I am making.  If a disease has a frequency of 1% and a test is applied that has a sensitivity of 80%, there is a different likelihood of it being positive or negative than if the disease had a frequency of one in 10,000.  All of these factors bear.<\/p> <p>  The statements that are being made about the performance of the test, and its sensitivity and specificity being low, at in and around 70% in relation to sensitivity, is correct.  It is broadly in line with the performance of the test in international hands.  Statements have been made about negative predictive value, in other words, if I get a negative test how likely is it that the disease is not present.  This is a very small figure.  It is a percentage figure that probably for the performance or test might even be much lower than the figure that has been given, and I am not in any sense disputing the figure my clinical colleague has given.  He may be referring to a different patient population where a higher incidence of the disease might exist.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we do not get confused and create a sense in which figures that are really important in terms of people's ability to be able to rely on the test and rely on the information they are getting in terms of predictive value, in some way appear on the part of the programme to be confused.  I take the point that in general terms the programme should, on a continuing basis like any source of information, continue to improve its communication.  This is not in any sense to say that erroneous information is being transmitted to patients.  It is really important that we get this point across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#AAA02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":432,"content":"<p>Dr. McKenna said he would change the leaflet.

I thank Mr. O'Brien.

This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the service user informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event.<\/blockquote> <p>So, the question at hand is whether Vicky Phelan was afforded open disclosure, and whether many other women, and possibly men, within the national screening service have been afforded open disclosure, and indeed there is a wider question now across the HSE, due to this.  From what I have seen in the past week, there is a conspiracy of silence within the healthcare system when it came to Vicky Phelan's case and when it came to several hundred other women who were not informed of false negatives.  Senior people within the national screening service knew the details of Vicky Phelan's case and they knew that hundreds of other women had not been communicated with.  Senior management within the HSE knew those things as well, and the doctors knew those things - maybe not in the hundreds but they knew that their own patients had not been communicated with.  People at the very highest levels within the HSE, at the level of direct reporting to Mr. O'Brien, at a senior level within the national screening service and senior consultants, all knew for years that the false negatives had occurred and as of today all of the women still have not been told.<\/p><p>I will start with Dr. Henry.  We know that he was made aware of this issue, not just Vicky Phelan's case, but the wider issue of women not being afforded open disclosure, why did he not inform Mr. O'Brien as the head of the HSE, and why did he not act to begin to put in place the measures which are now being put in place, in an emergency response - because this has gone public?

It stated that on further reviewing the letter CervicalCheck sent down to Dr. Hickey with respect to an audit of the cervical smears on cancer patients, CervicalCheck highlighted just three it felt should be considered for recall on discussion.  Dr. Hickey wrote there were a number of others that looked as though there were significant discrepancies, and he was somewhat uncomfortable about just recalling the three that CervicalCheck had highlighted.  Dr. Hickey had ten patients.  This was active correspondence from a consultant saying this matter was affecting ten of his patients.  Doctors have been told to use their discretion, but clearly Dr. Hickey was being told by CervicalCheck that only three of the ten needed to be told.

I have a question for Mr. O'Brien.  How can Irish clinicians conduct multi-disciplinary teamwork with people in different time zones, who use different nomenclature and perhaps different terminology regarding cervical cytology?  That is the first question.  Second, from the time the cervical screening programme was introduced, and we did not have the capacity in Ireland because there was a backlog, was any attempt made by the HSE to increase the capacity in the Irish system?  When the backlog was dealt with abroad, was the HSE working to ramp up capacity in the Irish system, based on the concerns of clinicians in Ireland in 2008?  Doing the job in the United States was a third of the price of what it was here.  Did that ring any alarm bells when it came to quality analysis?  I have come upon the McGoogan report from 2004, which laid out what we should be doing before we had the screening programme.  Here is recommendation 1.7 on how it should be conducted:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;A management structure with clear governance arrangements is required to ensure that the legal obligations to eligible women, health care professionals and staff participating in the Programme including Phase One are met.&quot;<\/blockquote> <p>Another recommendation: &quot;The establishment of effective governance arrangements with immediate effect is necessary in order to provide overall leadership and direction in terms of policy development&quot;, and so on.Recommendation 1.12: &quot;A quality assurance (QA) programme should continue to be given priority in the ICSP.&quot;  The report further recommends that:<\/p><blockquote>&quot;Structures must be put in place to allow review or revision of quality standards by a National ICSP Quality Assurance Committee which should include representation from the Professional bodies, other key stakeholders such as the Cancer Registry, the Cancer Society and other cancer screening programmes&quot;.<\/blockquote> <p>It seems that much of what was recommended did not actually happen.  Then I found the women's charter.  This is addressed to the women: &quot;All members of CervicalCheck staff will respect your privacy, dignity, religion, race and cultural beliefs.&quot;  It makes a commitment that women would always have the opportunity to make their views known and to have them taken into account.  Women are assured that their smear tests will be screened in an accredited quality-assured lab.  CervicalCheck also committed that a woman's result and any treatment recommendations would be provided to her and her nominated smear taker by the programme within four weeks.  In regard to that last point of the women's charter, I do not think Vicky Phelan got what it said on the tin.

Rather, I was invited to take up the role on the basis of a set of Government policies which were about the abolition of the HSE and the introduction of universal health insurance.  So I did the job in a particular way, in the context of that, for close to three years, expecting to be winding down the organisation and moving it into a collection of different types of service providers, hospital groups on a statutory basis and community health organisations.  As the Deputy knows, that did not happen.  I had discussions with the relevant Ministers.  What we have actually been doing is seeking to prepare the HSE for the type of future envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report as a result of which Government sanctioned: the appointment of a chief operations officer so that there is very clear accountability for the operating system; the appointment of a strategy and planning head in order that we have much more focus on planning to population need, as they do in other countries; and, just recently, for the first time ever in the Irish healthcare system, the appointment of a chief clinical officer.  So what I have been attempting to do in the second three years, and it has been extraordinarily slow because of the approvals processes one must go through, is come to a much more streamlined system of governance.  That is the only reason people have moved around in this context.  In an organisation the size of the HSE, people move around.  They have opportunities to apply for different jobs, posts become vacant and other people come in.  Yes, it is complicated.  An organisation the scale of the HSE is inherently complex.  I have long maintained that the structures of the HSE are in fact not fit for purpose.  I have been saying that throughout my time.  I have now got to a point where I think, subject to the implementation plan for Sl&aacute;intecare, that there is a much coherent organisation of functions at the top level which is useful and valid.

Did it concern Dr. Henry that there might be a legal problem caused by not making the disclosure in a timely manner?  The next issue is the time it takes to make a decision.  We are going over a period where no decision was made.  Did that not concern Dr. Henry?  He was the clinical officer.  Will this be the process in the future regarding any decisions that are to be made?  Will it go around the house and back again to the same place where it was two years previously?  Did that occur to Dr. Henry at the time?  I know he was not clinical director but surely it must have occurred to him that this delay was not acceptable.<\/p><p>My second question concerns the role of clinical director.  The clinical director was <i>in situ<\/i>for quite a period.  I know we are going back to 2008 when this process was set up.  The masters of the Coombe, Holles Street and the Rotunda have seven-year contracts.  In fairness, any of these roles are extremely demanding.  The person is dealing with a huge number of people and a number of different units throughout the country.  Likewise, a master of one of the maternity hospitals faces a huge number of demands.  Does Dr. McKenna not think the way forward might be to stipulate a defined period for the director's job?  The director can reapply when the job comes up for review but that process would be there.  I am just looking at the way forward.<\/p><p>What kind of timescale would be involved if we decided tomorrow morning that we wanted all smear tests to be dealt with here?  I know the Coombe is carrying out some analysis in this area in the sense that it is providing a service.  My understanding is that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland had a laboratory but that this service has now gone out to private enterprise.  I stand open to correction on that.  The process is being provided in Ireland.  How long would it take to put in place the requisite number of people with the skills necessary to deal with all of the smear tests that are done here?  Would it take two, three or four years?  What kind of period would it take us to build up those skills?  It is important to look at that.  Given that we have been sending tests out and using US companies for over ten years, surely we should be looking at trying to keep all of this work within the Irish jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#EEE00500","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":567,"content":"<p>As I outlined before, I first became aware of this on 11 July 2017.

One then has to get the sample to the laboratory where it must be processed correctly and then one has to get the information which the laboratory generates back to the referring doctor and to the patient.  Clearly, in this process, where the system has broken down is beyond the steps which I have laid out.  It broke down where a quality assurance programme was instituted, which was found to have failed.  In its failure, that information was not passed on.<\/p><p>The steps I have pointed out have worked pretty well, but it is the step beyond that, which is the conveying of wrong information to the patient, is the reason we are here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#FFF03700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter McKenna","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Has the witness identified precisely the weakest point or points, in the event of there being more than one which obviously there are?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#GGG00200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":622,"content":"<p>One must start off with the first point, which is that one must get the right people to enter into the service.

To be honest, that information should be at the top as the witnesses knew this issue had emerged in the press.  The witness made some disparaging remarks about tests being done on the kitchen table.  That is at odds with what Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith said.  He is not an insignificant person as a former master of the Rotunda Hospital and he called the service it ran accredited and world class.<\/p> <p>  One cannot dismiss the fact that this was predicted by people ten years ago.  In addition, they said it would be ten years before these problems would emerge.  Some &euro;20 per test multiplied by 3 million, which is &euro;60 million, was paid to a private company which makes massive profits and has connections with Goldman Sachs.  These people are in it for a reason, and it is not for patients.  That was not purely the HSE's decision.  The witness is correct that the D&aacute;il voted for that, despite counter arguments at the time.  The majority of parties, even if they ranted about it at the time, did not challenge it when they came into power.  It is the issue of public services being starved of resources and then being privatised.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about the rate of testing.  My understanding, and I am open to correction, is that the NHS guidelines are that 50 tests per day is the recommended best practice level.  Quest Diagnostics was doing 90 to 100.  I tried to calculate the figures by dividing 25,000 by 365, but presumably laboratories do not operate for 365 days a year.  They might take weekends off, but I do not know.  However, the rate in Quest Diagnostics must have been nearly twice what the NHS recommends.<\/p> <p>  A screener is only supposed to carry out a maximum of 5,000 per year.  If there is pressure to make profit by getting as many tests carried out as possible these things are absolutely inevitable.  Corners were cut in women's health at a time when the economy was going into recession.  Again, political parties took that decision.

What I am trying to address here is a sense that we have evidence of a substantial failure of the cytology service that people here depend on for the reliability of the tests.  We have to try to reassure people about that because they are genuinely worried and concerned.<\/p> <p>  We carry out approximately 250,000 smears per year.  The abnormal rate that is reported, between high grades and low grades, is approximately 8,000.  I will call that 10,000 for the purpose of simplicity.  That is 240,000 negative test results per year.  We know we have approximately 300 incident cases of cervical cancer in this country per year.<\/p><p>We believe the test performs at the rate of about 70% sensitivity.  That means it misses about 30% of cancers that are present at the time of testing.  For simplicity, we will say that works out to be somewhere in the region of 100 false negatives.  That gives a false negative rate of substantially less than 1%, therefore, when the accuracy figure of 99% set out in the figures is quoted, it is based on statistics like that.  That is a back of the envelope calculation.  What I am trying to illustrate is that the general assertion - I do not suggest Deputy Coppinger is making this particular assertion - is that there is some evidence here of a substantial failure in the cytology service being used to give people reassurance.  We simply do not have evidence of that.  There have been substantial failures.  There has been clear admission in regard to them, particularly in terms of unacceptable failures of communication to patients, but that cannot be equated with a statement or review.  I have to make that point about the cytology service and the evidence we have in terms of performance.  The point has been made by the director general that the differential performance, about which again there is a legitimate question, can be provided by way of response to the committee.  That may well help to satisfy some of the questions that have been asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#GGG01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I am going to extend Dr. Holohan's time.  I have a question on that.  In a case of a false negative, and the frequency of testing is every three years, the rate of growth of cervical cancer is slow.  If someone has a false negative and she comes back in three years' time, is there an estimation of how advanced that cancer would have progressed in those three years?  The benefit of screening is that women are screened every three years in order that a profile of the patient is being built up.  If there is a false negative on one smear, how much of a change would be expected in a three-year period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#HHH00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I could hazard offering an answer on that.  Once a woman has a visible, invasive cervical cancer, she will probably live without treatment for about 18 to 24 months.  However, we know, and this is one of the best studied areas of screening in any part of the body, that to get to that stage there is a pre-invasive stage that may take as long as 12 or 15 years, which starts off as a mild abnormality and usually progresses at a reasonable rate to a severe abnormality and then to cancer.  At any of those stages it can revert back to being normal, but the nearer one gets to having an invasive cervical cancer, the more likely it is to progress into being an invasive cancer.  The premise of the Chairman's question is whether one has several opportunities to catch it before it becomes invasive.  The answer is one has many opportunities.  This test, which has a high false negative rate, works because one has several attempts at it over the ten or 12-year period before it turns into an invasive cancer.  If it progressed more rapidly and the test was as good as it is now, it would not work but because it progresses so slowly, this test, which has error built into it, works.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#HHH00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter McKenna"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525248000,"counter":637,"content":"<p>To go back to the Deputy's question about the prediction Dr. David Gibbons made, I heard him saying that what is happening now is what he predicted.

The chief medical officer has just taken us through an explanation of why that is not what we are experiencing.  Dr. Gibbons did not predict that there would be a review process that would go so terribly wrong in terms of its communication to patients.  That review process going terribly wrong has got nothing to do with where the slides were read.  Such a review process would have had to occur wherever those slides were processed, including here, and there were such misses when the programme was based in Ireland in terms of its cytology process.  If the same flawed process of communication had occurred, we would still be here having this discussion because it is fundamentally not about an excessive level of miss, taking into account the limitations of this test.  Clearly, any miss is highly regrettable.  While we have this programme, the whole purpose is to prevent cervical cancer.  We do not take some satisfaction from the fact that the miss rate here is simply that which would normally be expected.  We would wish we had a better test, and we will move to a better test, but what Dr. Gibbons predicted is not what we are experiencing.

There will be an investigation into those facts and how they might have played out in these cases that might help to elucidate the specifics.  That goes to the heart of the question he asked earlier about the advice I gave the previous Minister for Health and now Taoiseach and gave to the current Minister which seems to be counterintuitive.  The reality is that it is complex.  In the minds of many medical practitioners, what plays into their decisions are fears over creating medical legal risk for themselves.  This may not be the reality in terms of genuine risk, but there is a perception there.  All too often when harm occurs, instead of embracing the opportunity to sit with patients and explain, sometimes the temptation on the part of practitioners is to circle the wagons, close ranks and not share information.  I could give a long list of cases where that has been at the very heart of those practices.<\/p> <p>  Without going into detail, the purpose ultimately of what is in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act is to essentially offer protections to doctors and standards on open disclosure, effectively saying that if they do it in the right way, these protections will be offered to them.  That allows us to give them reassurance and say that it is a safe and worthwhile thing to do and to encourage it.  There is a judgment at the heart of my advice around which is likely to be more effective, because we want to see disclosure happening in every case.<\/p><p>We want to encourage people to do the right thing rather than require them to do something they are unwilling to do.

I would like to give a little more detail of what the Taoiseach was talking about this morning, although in the circumstances, I do not want to spend a long time in describing it.  If we call the total 3,000 people for the purposes of discussion, whether they are part of the original 1,482 or the cohort that has to be identified, each case is to be looked at through an international process we are to establish.  We have taken steps to begin to mobilise some of that expertise.  It will require us to gain access to some of the slide materials from some of the laboratories.  It will require us to do the data matching that was described.  Any discordance, in the 208 cases we know about or any other one we might identify, will be subject to a full clinical review which will involve assessment by an international panel of experts capable of making it.  It will include a review of charts and a meeting with each of the individual patients.  Each individual woman who finds herself in this situation will have the question addressed as to the likelihood it has had an impact on either her treatment at the time of diagnosis or the eventual outcome.  In very tragic cases where people are no longer alive, for the next of kin who will such information, it will help to address some of the questions for them.<\/p> <p>  We also see some of the information in the findings of that process which will bring it to one report which will be published being made available to feed into ongoing consideration of the redress process that the Taoiseach this morning indicated that he was open to considering and to which the Government will give consideration.  We are also giving further consideration - I know that the Minister has taken steps today to engage with other parties to - to the question as to what will be the most effective investigative vehicle to bring closure to some of the items of information, in particular some of the additional items that came into the public domain last evening.  With the Minister amd as the director general said, we will receive receive daily reports from the head of the serious incident management team, SIMT, and Mr. Damien McCallion who will have operational responsibility.  We will receive a daily report from the director general on progress in the management of everything that has been described.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018050200002#NNN01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tony Holohan"},{"type":"speech","time":1525248000,"counter":841,"content":"<p>Thank you., Dr. Holohan.
