This was deferred from our last meeting.  At the last meeting, we agreed to look at the various minutes received up to now and at what the responses have been and maybe do a note for the members.<\/p><p> No. 3A.1 is correspondence dated 13 November 2013 from Mr. Martin Shanahan, chief executive officer of Forf&aacute;s, in response to questions raised at our meeting on 17 October 2013, to be noted and published.  This issue relates to the rent of office space which is vacant and it is a matter on which we will follow up in a forthcoming report.  We will also take up this matter with the Office of Public Works because it is a scandalous waste of public funds, amounting to &euro;1.4 million per year.<\/p><p> No. 3A.2 is correspondence dated 7 November 2013 from Dr. Olive Braiden, chair of the governor and guardians of the National Gallery of Ireland.  It is a response to the invitation to attend the committee today and it is to be noted.  In terms of how we will deal with this matter, I note the point made by Dr. Braiden that the issues relating to the payment to the director are for the gallery and the oversight Department and are not directly for the director who accepted the job.

I will call the Deputy then.  No. 3A.3 is correspondence from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, regarding the internal audit report, section 80, agencies' remuneration, which is to be noted.  This report was circulated to the committee last Thursday while the HSE officials were present dealing with the issue of medical cards.  The issue of top-up payments made to senior staff in the voluntary sector is the subject matter of considerable public comment.  We had intended that the matter be dealt with when HSE officials appear before us again in February, but given the level of payments revealed, it may be appropriate to deal with it sooner than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100003#B00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1385028300,"counter":12,"content":"<p>As the Chairman pointed out, the public is appalled at what has been revealed in this report and what has been in the media in recent days in regard to top-up payments in voluntary hospitals and in a range of State agencies which depend on the public purse for a significant amount of their resources.  It paints a picture of a \"because I'm worth it\" sort of culture which was endemic in some of these organisations throughout the Celtic tiger years but it seems it has not gone away.  Looking at the report, some of the reportage around it and some of the public commentary, some of the agencies involved have been playing a game of cat and mouse with the HSE and the Department of Health.  It is appropriate we hold special meetings on this issue of serious public interest.  I suggest we do so next week and not only should we invite the Department of Health and the HSE to appear before committee but we should also invite the CEOs of the voluntary hospitals and the chairs of the boards of management.  One might ask why we should invite the chairs of the boards.  The chairs of the boards and the boards themselves are responsible for setting pay policy in those hospitals and agencies.  It is important to insist on their appearance before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100003#B00500","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1385028300,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We have an internal audit report from the HSE before us.

The meetings we held on public sector allowances, where we brought in the various groups, provide a framework which worked well.  It is very much in the public interest that we look at this issue.

It is not the right way to do business.  The Committee of Public Accounts had expressed the view that it needed clarification on this when it first emerged in 2012.  The report was given to the clerk when we were discussing the medical card issue, but it was too late for us to mention it, flag it or have a briefing on it.  I am disappointed with the HSE and the Department of Health that that was the case.<\/p><p>  Given the content of the report and the concern being expressed in all quarters about the payments, I agree with Deputy Nash that we should bring in those concerned as soon as possible.  We have a timetable for next week and a schedule for Thursday, but we should insist the HSE appears before us on Tuesday or Wednesday to explain the circumstances of this report.  I will ask for clarification to see if the CEOs and the chairs of the boards can be brought before us, or on how we will handle this.  That will be a matter of procedure.  We cannot have them all in on the same day, so perhaps we should start with the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the HSE.  We should insist on an early hearing and I suggest Tuesday or Wednesday to accommodate members in terms of other meetings and so on.<\/p><p>  Perhaps we could write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the practice of top-up payments, although that might be the wrong Department and I am open to advice on this.  Can this be found in other Departments?  We have an example today in regard to the National Gallery of Ireland of, I think, roughly &euro;90,000 gross.  We want to establish whether these payments are being made across the system.  Perhaps we need to raise it with all Departments to see what their understanding of these payments is in the context of senior executives or employees in the agencies for which they are responsible.  I suggest we bring in the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the HSE next Tuesday or Wednesday and that we write to each Department to determine whether the practice exists in other Departments and that we seek that clarification.  We can conduct our business from there.  Is it agreed we start with the HSE?  Agreed.<\/p><p>  No. 3A.4 is correspondence dated 14 November 2012 from Mr. Fred Barry, chief executive officer of the National Roads Authority, providing further information arising from issues raised at our meeting on 7 February 2013, to be noted and published.  No. 3A.5 is correspondence dated 18 November 2013 from Mr. Neil Whoriskey, secretary of the Central Bank of Ireland, in response to an invitation to attend a meeting with the committee.  That was circulated to members.  I understand a date has been set for the Central Bank of Ireland to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and that the Governor has relied on the fact that the only time he appears before this committee is on foot of a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General but we do not have such a report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100003#B01000","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speech","time":1385028900,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I think we should note it, without accepting what the Governor says.  What he is trying to say is that he will appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on his own terms.  This is important because the Governor did appear before.  There was a reply to the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to the effect that the bank does not go into specific cases.  On television last Wednesday or Thursday, however, the Governor went very deeply into the case of Newbridge Credit Union and answered specific questions on it.  I would not like to accept the assertion, therefore, that representatives from the Central Bank do not answer questions on specific cases posed by this committee or the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform when they do so on \"Prime Time\".  It is probably not worth making a huge issue of this right now because we have enough on our plate.

There may be policy issues here with regard to delineation.  Obviously, there is a policy opinion in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office and they are comfortable with that.  I think there are larger policy issues when it comes to a committee such as the Committee of Public Accounts with regard to using and dealing with information.  In the last few days, I have been dealing with the HSE and the Garda in my constituency.  In this instance, the HSE did not share the information with the Garda, which is unbelievable considering what the actual issue is.  Legal counsel deals strictly with what is prescribed by law.

The most significant element of expenditure was pay, which accounted for &euro;5.2 million, while non-pay costs were &euro;2.2 million.  Grant-in-aid funding of just over &euro;1 million was provided in 2012.  This was paid into two grant-in-aid fund accounts.  Transactions on the grant-in-aid fund accounts are set out in note 7 to the appropriation account.  The National Gallery's gross expenditure fell by around &euro;1 million between 2011 and 2012.  Almost all of the reduction related to cut of 50% in the grant-in-aid provision under subhead A.3.  Up to 2011, that grant-in-aid funding was allocated for the acquisition and conservation of artworks.  Accumulated reserves of &euro;3 million were held at the end of 2011 for those purposes.  In 2012 the bulk of the &euro;1 million grant was allocated to building refurbishment work.  This change in scope of the subhead is in the context of the National Gallery's master development plan, which aims to complete the renovation of the two oldest wings by spring 2016.<\/p><p>  Members may also wish to note that the statement on internal financial control in the introduction to the account discloses that the National Gallery undertook a review of its security procedures following an incident in June 2012 in which a visitor to the National Gallery caused substantial damage to a painting on public display. <\/p><p>  In examining the appropriation account, the committee should be aware that the National Gallery's income from retail and fundraising activities is not treated as appropriations in aid of the Vote.  Those activities and the related expenditure are accounted for in consolidated financial statements which are prepared on an accruals basis.  They are separately audited by me.<\/p><p>  Following the 2010 audit, we proposed changes to improve the format of the consolidated statements.  The National Gallery agreed and substantially revised the format of the consolidated statements for the 2011 year of account.  The process of preparing and auditing the revised-format accounts has been protracted, but I expect the files on the audits of both the 2011 and 2012 financial statements to be submitted to me shortly for my review.  <\/p><p>  Chapter 15 of my report on the accounts for public services 2012 deals with two matters relating to staff appointments at the National Gallery.  The chapter outlines the circumstances surrounding a payment made in 2012 to the newly appointed director of the National Gallery.  The audit found that, in addition to salary, an amount of &euro;40,000 was paid to the director.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had sanctioned the pay and conditions and specified that no additional benefits in cash or in kind were payable apart from reasonable vouched removal expenses.  Of the &euro;40,000 paid, supporting vouchers to the value of some &euro;3,700 had been received by the National Gallery.  For tax compliance purposes, the National Gallery grossed the unvouched element of the expenses payment to around &euro;87,000 and paid the related tax.<\/p> <p>The full amount of this expenditure was met from the National Gallery's non-Exchequer resources.  <\/p><p> The other matter dealt with in the Chapter concerns the costs related to the outcome of a Labour Court case.  During 2012, the National Gallery reinstated six security attendants who had been made redundant in September 2011.  The attendants had originally been hired in 2002 on fixed-term contracts.  Following legal proceedings by some of the attendants, the Labour Court found that they were entitled to contracts of indefinite duration.  The National Gallery incurred expenditure in the region of &euro;420,000 as a result, including arrears of salary for the 15-month period between redundancy and reinstatement.  Further legal costs of approximately &euro;7,500 were in dispute.<\/p><p> The legal provision underpinning contracts of indefinite duration is the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003.  That Act prohibits the use of successive fixed-term contracts and provides that an employee is entitled to a contract of indefinite duration once he or she has been on fixed-term contracts for more than four years, unless there is objective justification for keeping the employee on fixed-term contracts.  Entitlement to contracts of indefinite duration is an issue that also arises in other public bodies, especially in the education sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100007#F02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385031300,"counter":103,"content":"<p>We have two distinct issues to deal with today: the appointment of the director and the issue of the reinstatement of staff who are deemed to be on contracts of indefinite duration.

His appointment was the culmination of a successful global search and selection process extending over 16 months.<\/p><p>  The National Gallery ranks among the leading galleries in the world, as is evidenced by the fact that collection exchange and partnership arrangements exist with leading galleries including the Louvre, the Prado and National Gallery of Washington.  It is a resource for Irish people and one of the principal attractions for overseas visitors.  In making the first appointment to the position of director in a quarter of a century, the board recognised that it needed to secure an appointment which inspired confidence in us among our international partners.  It also required a person who could lead the largest refurbishment in the National Gallery's history and achieve efficiencies in a period of stringency, while inspiring the public with the approach to and the range of exhibitions.  In Sean Rainbird, the board believes it has found a director of this calibre.<\/p><p>  From the outset, the National Gallery was guided in its approach to the search and selection of a director by the advice of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The Public Appointments Service, PAS, was used to manage the selection process.  The procedures overseen by PAS included the appointment of an independent person as chair of the selection board, the inclusion of a senior official from the Department on the interview panel and the clearance approval of the candidate information with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The selection process concluded in July 2011.  <\/p><p>  The sanction letter mentioned in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which authorised the terms of offer of the appointment, was issued by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in November 2011.  This sanctioned the appointment of Mr. Rainbird at the fifth point of the Principal Officer salary scale.  I confirm that Mr. Rainbird took up the position in April 2012 and was paid the salary sanctioned in the November 2011 letter.  I also confirm that Mr. Rainbird's salary was adjusted downwards in July 2013 in line with the terms of the Haddington Road agreement.  Mr. Rainbird is not in receipt of any additional salary from any source in connection with his appointment as director of the National Gallery.<\/p><p>  The sanction letter of November 2011 provided for the payment of \"reasonable vouched removal expenses\" to enable Mr. Rainbird to take up the position of director.  The board sought guidance from the Department on the approach to determining, setting and paying these removal expenses and was advised that the board ought itself to interpret the wording in the sanction letter.  The board's determination, which was considered and approved by the board, was that a candidate taking up the position and based abroad prior to appointment should be no worse off than if the candidate had been based in Ireland.<\/p><p>  The appointment of Mr. Rainbird is for a fixed term of five years.  Given that his family resides overseas and the brevity of the contract period, Mr. Rainbird was not in a position to relocate his family to Ireland.  In these circumstances, the approach to removal was that Mr. Rainbird be enabled to make 40 trips per annum to visit his family over the period of the contract.  Each trip was estimated to cost &euro;200.  For administrative convenience and to avoid any possible confusion with the reimbursement of business travel, the determined amount was paid up-front to Mr. Rainbird.  Provision was made for clawback in the event of Mr. Rainbird's departing prior to the end of his contract.  The National Gallery is conducting an annual review to ensure there is vouching of the travel that is being undertaken in visiting his family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Olive Braiden"},{"type":"speech","time":1385031300,"counter":105,"content":"<p>May we publish that statement?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100008#G00400","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385031300,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100008#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Olive Braiden"},{"type":"speech","time":1385031300,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Rainbird to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100008#G00600","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385031300,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I refer to the matter raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General in Chapter 15 of his report for 2012, entitled Award of Contracts of Indefinite Duration to Gallery Staff.<\/p><p>  In 2002, the National Gallery recruited an additional 30 attendant staff to provide security and cleaning services in its new Millennium Wing.  In accordance with the sanction obtained by the Department of Finance, all of these staff were employed on fixed-term or special-purpose contracts, related to the then impending commencement of the master development plan, MDP, a major refurbishment of the National Gallery&rsquo;s historic buildings.  By 2011, when the MDP commenced, there were 14 staff on fixed-term or special-purpose contracts, which expired in accordance with their terms and conditions of employment on 30 September 2011.  Of those, six staff made claims for contracts of indefinite duration - in effect, permanent contracts.  After three claims were lost in the Labour Court in late 2012, it was agreed that the National Gallery should concede the other three cases, as they were almost identical.  This decision was approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the National Gallery sought approval for 30 permanent attendant staff <font color=\"#4F4F4F\">in <\/font>2002, but was only given approval to recruit on a fixed-term or special-purpose basis because of the impending MDP.  At that time, it was anticipated that the MDP would commence within 18 months.  In writing the contracts of employment for these staff, the National Gallery sought legal advice to ensure, as far as was possible, that they complied with the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and did not confer permanent tenure rights on these employees.  The MDP eventually commenced in March 2011 and, in accordance with the special-purpose contracts, their term expired in September 2011 and the staff were let go at that time.  Six staff appealed their termination and began the process of appeal to the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission.  Rights commissioner decisions were appealed to the Labour Court.<\/p> <p>In late 2012, the Labour Court found in favour of the claimants in the first three cases.  The gallery's defence failed because the Labour Court concluded that the grounds used in the contracts did not amount to \"objective grounds\" within the meaning of the Act, because details of the MDP were \"unknown and unknowable\" at the time when the contracts would otherwise become CIDs.  There was no firm approval, contract, funding or commencement date for the MDP, and the gallery also had a permanent need for these staff at that time.<\/p><p> Following the Labour Court decisions, it was decided not to appeal to the High Court and, therefore, the six staff were reinstated in accordance with the Labour Court decisions made in the first three cases.  This decision was approved by the Department of  Public Expenditure and Reform.  The gallery incurred expenditure of approximately &euro;428,000 on the claims brought by the six staff for contracts of indefinite duration.  This includes &euro;281,000 for reinstatement costs, being the gross cost of salary arrears up to reinstatement, &euro;132,000 for legal costs and &euro;15,000 for compensation set by the Labour Court.  Redundancy costs previously paid to staff were recouped in full.  Due to subsequent staff departures, the employees who were taken back are required by the gallery and are productively employed.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the gallery was aware at all times of the consequences of employing these staff on fixed-term contracts.  The contract terms were imposed by the Department of Finance in 2002 and the fact that the MDP was inordinately delayed until 2011, which delay invalidated the specific purpose grounds relied upon in the contracts, was totally outside the control of the gallery.  The gallery managed the fixed-term special purpose contracts as competently as possible, and even with the benefit of hindsight, could not have done anything differently in order to protect the integrity of the contracts issued.  The gallery will continue to ensure that all contracts issued will stand up to scrutiny in accordance with the legislation, but cannot prevent the possibility of a recurrence of what happened in these cases,  because of matters outside its control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100008#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Rainbird","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385031900,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Thank you Mr. Rainbird.

We have a very good exchange of works with other institutions, whether for a whole exhibition going from our collection or individual works going to other exhibitions in other venues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2013112100011#K04500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Rainbird"},{"type":"speech","time":1385033100,"counter":257,"content":"<p>That is me finished.

There was never an infusion of significant capital to arts infrastructure at any point.  The prioritisation of capital developments within the arts sector was a policy prioritisation beginning with the millennium wing in 2000, moving through the Collins Barracks development in 2002 and on to the National Gallery development in 2010.

If it was a class action it would probably be rather less expensive as it would have involved arguing in one court at one time with one legal representation.  In one sense the way in which the legal process has occurred has added to the cost.  The longevity of this case over several years has meant that the costs are rather high because of the time and the number of people involved.  Deputy Connaughton&rsquo;s point is absolutely valid.

When it is now raised as a specific point - it is not that it has nothing to do with Mr. Rainbird but he happens to be here - it is the issue of the Department giving guidelines to boards to ensure their compliance.  For the Department to say the board itself should interpret the matter is at least a little odd in view of the fact that Dr. Braiden was attempting to get advice from Revenue, from, I presume, some accountancy firm and from the Department on the payment of this removal expense.

While it is likely to put certain strains on the balance sheets of some of our members, the marts in question have the capacity to absorb any losses likely to emerge from the receivership process.  The turnover of TLT International was approximately &euro;35 million and represented a relatively small proportion of national mart sales, which involves a throughput of 1.7 million animals a year with a sales turnover value of approximately &euro;1.2 billion.  While the receiver has not, as of yet provided a detailed quantification of the debtor schedule for TLT International, our own estimates, derived from informal consultation with the trade would suggest that collective mart exposure to the TLT International receivership is between &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million.  Our understanding is that part of the explanation for the variance between the &euro;3 million and &euro;4 million estimate relates to a requirement on the part of the receiver to assess the extent to which some farmers may have recovered stock which had been purchased but not paid for by TLT International.<\/p><p>  Undoubtedly, this level of potential loss is an unwelcome shock for the sector.  However, any consultations we have had with our membership since this crisis arose would confirm that those of our co-operative livestock marts affected have the capacity to withstand this shock.  Anyone familiar with dealing with our livestock mart members over a long number of years would be aware that one of their key strengths has been their willingness and capacity to guarantee to pay all sellers of stock promptly and to honour those payments.  As they have consistently done over the past 60 years, our marts are committed to continuing to pay all customers promptly for their stock.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the Property Services Regulatory Authority last year with its powers to licence and regulate the mart sector has been welcomed by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, as it reinforces and underpins the existing commitment and practice on the part of our co-operative livestock marts to guarantee to pay all sellers of stock through the livestock mart system.<\/p><p>  The credit policy of the marts has been the subject of much discussion and comment over the past several weeks.<\/p> <p>The provision of credit to certain purchasers of stock by some of our marts has been an ongoing challenge for the ICOS marts committee.  The issue of credit policy has been the subject of a number of consultations and discussions and indeed regional meetings of our mart members in the last 12 months.<\/p><p> The policy of the ICOS marts committee, particularly under its present chairman, Michael Spellman, has been to seek to advise and encourage marts to move to a policy of not providing credit to purchasers of stock.  Given the structure and trading traditions of the mart sector, the acceptance by our marts of such a policy was never going to be achieved overnight.  One of the observations of the marts committee has been that it is in those parts of the country with a large number of private and co-operative marts with single mart centre operations competing against one another that some mart boards have found it most challenging to introduce a more prudent credit policy.  Those mart operations with a number of sales outlets and larger scale operations have, by and large, been more successful in managing their credit policies.<\/p><p> It should also be pointed out that even where a co-operative livestock mart does have the capacity to enforce a restrictive credit policy, it will continue to have the normal exposure between sales that arise from the fact that even where a cheque has been issued by a purchaser of stock, it will still take five to seven days to clear the banking system.  ICOS has examined other forms of security from purchasers that are in use in other sectors and to date, such instruments have proven to be too expensive and cumbersome for our livestock marts.  In addition, the general caution now being exercised by our commercial banks with regard to their credit policy for small and medium-sized enterprises has resulted in greater pressure from purchasers of stock for more liberal credit facilities.  The business environment which marts are currently encountering with increasing cost pressures arising from every increasing regulatory burdens - be they health and safety, welfare, environmental and more recently, the costs associated with compliance with the licensing requirements of the Property Services Regulatory Authority - is posing problems in respect of the number of individual mart firms currently competing with each other .<\/p><p> ICOS has a clearly enunciated policy in respect of the need for mart consolidation and rationalisation.  In many instances, this does not require the closure of mart centres as such as at times, seasonal supplies of stock would require all of the existing capacity available.  What is required, however, is the consolidation of a number of mart centres into one co-operative society with a view to achieving economies of scale.  This enhances the potential for improved efficiencies and gives co-operative mart boards and management a better capability to introduce appropriate policies around the provision of credit.  Without some form of rationalisation and consolidation, the danger is that in some areas of the country, marts will continue to compete with one another on the basis of the level of credit they are willing to offer to purchasers of stock.  Ultimately, the role of co-operative marts is to improve price transparency in the cattle sector through providing a live auction system that allows a certain volume of stock to be exported live from this country and in so doing, provide farmers with a very valuable and transparent countervailing force to the dominance of a small number of privately owned beef processing factories in this country.<\/p><p> In conclusion, while ICOS is not in a position to guarantee future outcomes, the past performance of our co-operative livestock marts has been to honour all its transactions with its farmer customers and this is still the stated intention and objective of our livestock marts.  My colleagues, Michael Spellman and Ray Doyle who is the ICOS marts secretary, and I will be happy to address and questions and expand on some of the issues raised in this contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus O&rsquo;Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385031900,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting the IFA here today to address this issue.  When I was here with the committee last October, I outlined the findings of an IFA-commissioned report carried out by Professor Alan Renwick from UCD which quantifies the huge contribution the cattle and sheep sectors make to the Irish economy, particularly the local rural economy.  Professor Renwick showed that the livestock sector generates &euro;2.3 billion worth of output at the farm gate which equates to total output of &euro;5.7 billion for the national economy.  The sectors support 100,000 farmers and over 50,000 jobs in the wider economy.  The cattle and sheep sectors deliver a real return in every rural parish, generating economic activity and providing employment across the country.  Combined, the sectors have an unparalleled reach in terms of their contribution to the rural and wider economy.  Professor Renwick's figures also showed that every &euro;1 of direct payment invested in the cattle and sheep sector underpins over &euro;4 in the economy.  There is no doubt that the cattle and sheep sectors are hugely important to the Irish economy and particularly the rural economy.<\/p><p>  The live export trade is a critically important part of the livestock sector in this country.  On an annual basis, Ireland exports between 150,000 and 300,000 head of animals.  These include calves, weanlings, forward store cattle and 30,000 to 80,000 head of sheep.  The importance of the live trade cannot be underestimated in terms of its role in creating price competition.  It is important to point out that the live export trade is heavily regulated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and operates to the highest international and EU standards in terms of animal welfare.  Previous UCD studies from Dr. John O'Connell indicate that the live trade provides price competition in the region of up to &euro;76 per head on cattle.  On the sheep side, with the opening up of the live trade to Libya for the very first time this year, the IFA estimated the live trade was worth an extra &euro;6 to &euro;8 per head on the price of lamb during the peak selling months of June, July and August.  So again, the live export is vital to cattle and sheep price competition.<\/p><p>  Against this background, the recent announcement that TLT International has been placed into receivership by its main bank HSBC is bad news.  TLT has been the dominant Irish exporter of weanlings to the Italian market, shipping up to 21,000 cattle annually in recent years and several tens of thousands of sheep to EU markets.  In total, Ireland exported 37,855 cattle to Italy in 2012, back from 53,678 in 2011.  Total Irish live cattle exports to all markets in 2012 were 160,407 head and total sheep live exports were about 40,000 head.  Total live exports to Italy to date in 2013 are at about 23,000.  This is back from 33,000 during the same period in 2012.  TLT had exported just over 11,500 of these animals to Italy.  It also exported live cattle to Greece, Tunisia and Libya this year.<\/p><p>  When news of the TLT receivership broke on Friday, 8 November, the IFA 's solicitors were in direct contact with the receiver, Gear&oacute;id Costello of Grant Thornton.  The IFA arranged a meeting with Mr. Costello along with the ICOS marts committee representatives.  The IFA made it very clear that payment to farmers and marts for livestock must be prioritised.  The IFA also highlighted to the receiver that farmers and marts would be claiming retention of title on any livestock recently purchased and not yet gone for export.  On 12 November, the IFA met with the directors of TLT, Mr. Paulo Garavelli and Mr. Davide Garavelli, at their export premises in Mullingar accompanied by ICOS.  Again, the IFA made it clear that payment to farmers and marts must be prioritised.  Later on that Tuesday evening, the IFA and ICOS organised a meeting in the Sheraton Hotel in Athlone attended by 70 mart managers and farmers.   At all stages, the IFA has made it very clear to both the receiver, the directors of TLT and the bank that payment for livestock must be prioritised.  The key component to finding any type of acceptable resolution to this situation is that farmers and marts are paid for the livestock supplied.  The IFA has also been in contact with HSBC, which appointed the receiver.  The specific details in respect of the full extent of the liabilities and creditors of TLT are still not available either from the receiver or TLT's directors.  Mr. O'Donohoe mentioned one of the reasons why clarity has not arisen and all the individual farmers have not yet come to discuss it.  There is an urgent need for clarity on the extent of the creditors and debtors in respect of TLT and the IFA has called on the receiver to make this information available.<\/p><p>  What is known and already outlined in the media is that HSBC is owed in the region of &euro;3 million and AIB is owed in the region of &euro;750,000.  We also know that up to 30 marts are owed millions of euro and a relatively small number of farmers are also owed an unknown amount of money at this stage.<\/p> <p>It appears that the company has very few tangible fixed assets and it has been reported that the Mullingar export layerage and the trucks were leased to the company.  The main company assets appear to be trading debts due from customers in Italy.<\/p><p> The directors of TLT must take full responsibility for their position and work to ensure all farmers and marts are paid in full for their livestock purchases.  The IFA has made it clear to the receiver that payments for farmers and marts must be prioritised.  The goodwill of farmers and marts is a crucial aspect of the business but it will only remain if farmers and marts are prioritised.  The receiver, the bank, the current directors of TLT and potential buyers and debtors will be aware that the farmer and mart, as creditors, are essential to the business.  A satisfactory resolution to these aspects will have to be found before progress can be made.  The IFA will continue to work with everyone involved to progress matters but our priority is achieving payment for farmers and marts.  Our policy on payments to farmers for livestock has always been to insist on payment on the day and we encourage farmers to sell through the marts because they have an excellent record of payment.  Farmers expect that payment is guaranteed when they sell an animal in a mart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385032500,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Paul Smyth from the ICMSA to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100005#E00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385032500,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I will briefly set out the ICMSA's views on the closure of TLT.  We have received a considerable number of complaints in recent weeks regarding the closure of TLT.  It is the view of the ICMSA that the farmers concerned should be preferential creditors when it comes to the company's assets.  As we have heard, there is a limited amount of fixed assets available for sale.  It is the view of the ICMSA that farmers should receive payment upfront before entering into contracts but unfortunately that is not always the case.  Goodwill has often prevailed.  We heard about shipments over the weekend and we hope that retention of title is made to the farmers who produced the animals concerned.<\/p><p>  Ireland is an export economy.  If we are to meet the Food Harvest 2020 goal of increasing dairy output by 50%, there will be many more instances of farmers trying to export animals in future.  As export companies represent competition for Irish marts and factories, it is essential that the Government provides some form of credit insurance.  The Government received a report on this subject from KPMG several years ago and we would like to see an export insurance scheme not only for the farming industry but also for exporters if we are to be serious about developing our agriculture and other industries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1385032500,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Gabriel Gilmartin from the ICSA to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100005#E00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385032500,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on TLT.  Our first concern is the immediate difficulties faced by farmers and marts owed money.  For a farmer, the exposure is traumatic.  This is also a time for mart managers and committees.  The early indications are that the bulk of the debt is owed to marts.  While there is considerable speculation about the scale of the money owed to individual marts, much of it has been based on wild guesses.  Assuming they have been diligent in managing credit level and in pursuing moneys owed to them, we expect that the marts have been run profitably for several years and will have the financial resources to ensure business as usual.  We must be careful to avoid exaggerating the extent to which marts are exposed or, worse, speculating on the position of individual marts.  Confidence in the marts is vital to the livestock trade just as confidence in the financial system is vital to the economy.<\/p><p>  The marts affected by the TLT issue continue to trade.  While concerns understandably arose when the story broke, farmers continue to bring stock to marts.  In the past few weeks it has been business as usual.  The fact that the marts are paying their clients promptly is reassuring.  Some of the marts involved have confirmed that they have put reserves in place.  That is an important step in rebuilding confidence.  Demands that the marts should publicly declare what they are owed are premature.  Mart committees need to tread carefully in any public statements they make.  A blanket statement to the effect that a mart is owed thousands of euro is meaningless unless it is set in the context of the mart's overall financial position.  A mart's financial position is best understood when the auditors lay the full accounts in front of an AGM.  A loss of &euro;50,000 could have entirely different effects in two marts, depending on their underlying viability.  In due course, each mart will be accountable to its shareholders at its AGM but, in the sort term, the interest of shareholders are best served by ensuring that mart managers and their committees take steps to maintain confidence in the mart by paying promptly for livestock.<\/p><p>  The immediate worry is how farmers and marts will get what they are owed.  The receiver who has been appointed by the bank will follow the regulations, which provide that the receiver and the banks are paid before everybody else.  There will be lingering doubts about whether HSBC made its biggest mistake in advancing credit in the first place or in being too hasty in appointing a receiver.  An argument can be made that the best way to ensure the maximum return to all creditors would have involved an examinership or a more gradual wind-down of the credit facilities rather than a receivership, which has wiped out TLT without hope of recouping all of the moneys owed.<\/p><p>  In the broader context the question that exercises most thought concerns the impact on live exports and the cattle trade in general.  I am concerned that the impact of the TLT closure has been understated, particularly in political circles.  There is reason to be hopeful that demand for livestock in Europe and North Africa will remain constant and that the slack will be taken up by other Irish exporters.  However, it would be naive to think this will happen easily.  The directors of TLT built up a base of customers over many years and there is no obvious reason to expect these relationships to be readily taken over by another Irish exporter.  Its influence on the Italian market was particularly important for suckler farmers, who have bred top of the range weanlings.  Moreover, the credit terms required by continental buyers are not going to soften just because of the TLT experience.<\/p><p>  The credit facility of &euro;3 million which HSBC made available to TLT is now off the table and marts have an exposure of up to &euro;3 million.  That means we will have to find &euro;6 million elsewhere.  Regardless of the marts' exposure, they are likely to be much more cautious in the foreseeable future, with the consequence that we will either have to develop an export trade based on payment up front or find a better way of financing the sector.  Neither option looks simple.  I have heard it said that TLT deserved to go under because it paid &euro;50 too much on average.<\/p> <p>However, if the trade to Italy is undermined, by how much will top grade weanlings fall in 2014?  The progressive suckler farmer breeding top grade weanlings has no scope to take lower prices.<\/p><p> Farmers will be concerned also that any reduction in live exports will be a silver lining for the meat factories.  Recent years have demonstrated that beef price and levels of live exports are linked.  The higher level of dairy calf exports in 2013 has been welcome after the collapse of 2012.  There has also been a positive reaction from farmers to new live cattle export markets out of Europe to places such as Libya and Tunisia, some of which involved TLT.  All of this ensured that cattle were scarcer for the meat industry here, and scarcity equals firmer prices.  It must also be remembered that TLT was involved in live sheep exports and, again, the concern is that less live exports means lower factory prices for sheep farmers.<\/p><p> It will be this time next year before an accurate assessment can be made.  Fortunately, Irish beef finishers have been strong customers for weanlings in recent weeks.  However, the key for any mart and for the wider sector is to ensure that there is a strong trade over the full 12 months.  The whole episode is a huge wake-up call to us all.  ICSA believes very firmly that unless there is competition on some sort of an equal footing between live exports and the meat factories, the future for sucklers in particular is very bleak.<\/p><p> It seems absurd that a deficiency of perhaps &euro;6 million could completely undermine the potential for expansion as set out in Food Harvest 2020, but that is the reality.  It is not long ago that a key player in the Irish meat processing sector got into difficulty with exports.  The Government at the time seemed to believe that regardless of the cost, the export of beef had to be supported.  The question we now face is whether the Government of today understands and is committed to the importance of live exports.  I am not suggesting that TLT should be bailed out.  However we must examine what needs to be done to support the rest of the live export sector, the marts and the farmers who produce export grade weanlings.  We also need to be concerned that a significant reduction in live exports could impact on the shipping service provided by Celtic Link.<\/p><p> In the final analysis, the overall debacle again raises the question of the availability of credit to the livestock business.  Just as cattle and sheep farmers have found credit being squeezed by banks, TLT discovered that the banking sector seems to be intent on continuing to reduce its exposure to the sector.  It is also time to consider whether a different model can be developed to support live exports, one which does not depend on a small number of essentially small limited companies taking risks to drive the business.<\/p><p> Is there a role for export credit insurance?  How would this be funded, especially given State aid rules?  Is there a role for a co-operative structure?  Can we deal with the financing required and what are the credit options that do not leave marts or farmers exposed?<\/p><p> It is easy to pontificate about the risks that marts take in extending credit.  But in the real world, credit is an integral part of most commerce across Europe, and the EU Commission has been to the fore in pushing for credit terms of 30 days.  Marts have played a crucial role in supporting a policy in favour of live exports that has been enthusiastically backed by farm organisations, politicians and farmers.  In most cases, marts did not provide extended credit facilities to any individual company, but are caught by the fact that one good sale involving as little as seven days' credit can involve tens of thousands of euro.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine needs to realise that the future of live exports is now an urgent issue and at minimum needs to be treated in the same way as the closure of a large scale employer.  A task force to examine the way forward for live exports might be a first step.  I thank the Chairman.  Mr. Eddie Punch and I are open to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Gilmartin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385033100,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gilmartin.

There is significant concern among committee members about this issue.  What we need to do can be broken into two parts.  There is the issue of the receivership of TLT international and I concur it is a pity it is not an examinership and then there is the wider policy issue for the future.<\/p><p>  I welcome Mr. O'Donohoe's reassurance that the co-operative marts can take the hit of the receivership and farmers will continue, as they have for many years, to receive their payments from the marts and none will be left short.  That is important because the last thing we need is them holding back cattle from marts and refusing to trade.  We should not be part of scaremongering in this regard.  I take Mr. O'Donohoe's reassurance on behalf of the co-operative marts at face value.  He has stated categorically that marts will honour every payment they owe to every customer and will continue to do so.<\/p><p>  Mr. Byran said he wanted farmers to get priority in payment.  The receiver is bound by the law and there is a hierarchy of rights, including Revenue, preferential creditors and so on.  I would like to tease out of the issue of farmers who sold directly to TLT International and who are, therefore, creditors.  We have a reassurance from the marts that anyone who deal through a mart will be paid.  The second issue centres on farmers dealing with companies who when they go bust leave them high and dry.  There are three elements to this.  The first is the credit policy for marts.  It is correct that every mart should restrict credit according to what has been done in the context of property registration.  They cannot be using clients accounts, which is more or less what they have to do when they give credit.  We need to have another meeting to tease that out more fully how we as legislators can address that.  We should consider whether the law needs to be amended to say that where farmers deal with marts or meat factories they are granted a  preferential payment status and, in other words, become preferential creditors.  We will not solve that problem today but it needs to be examined.<\/p><p>  Mr. Gilmartin spoke eloquently about live exports and the wider issue for the distant future.  If we do not have a live export trade, the meat processors will control the price because we live on an island.  The final issue, therefore, we should discuss in the context of development a policy and encourage the Minister to develop a policy on is how we create sustainable live exports in such a way that farmers or marts are not left exposed.  If one has a factory, one has many buildings and so on but a live exporter does not have to put the same infrastructure to put in place and is, therefore, at more risk.  As a country, while we would prefer to slaughter the vast majority of cattle in Ireland and retain jobs here, without a competitive live export trade, farmers will not achieve the maximum price for the cattle.  We need a structured live export trade built on the firm foundations of a coherent Government policy on live exports and not on waiting for the market to make it happen.  The issue of credit and so on should be examined in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100007#H00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1385033400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>This needs to be broken into four distinct areas: the TLT International episode; a live exports policy for the future; credit control; and who becomes a  preferential creditor.<\/p> <p>That is a reasonable way to focus on it from the outset.

That is not correct.  I understand it has been placed in receivership by HSBC.  It is important to correct that fact because on this issue all the facts need to be correct if people are to have confidence in what is going on.<\/p><p>  The farming organisations have made it clear that TLT going into receivership will cause a problem for farmers and the prices they will get.  Last night I met several farmers who are affected by this.  They claim it is already affecting them by up to &euro;300 per animal.  The loss of the main live exporter will cause a problem.  It has been suggested that others will take up the slack, but who will take up the slack?  One of the people who is supposed to take up the slack owns a meat factory here and the others just export to Hungary and Germany.  One of the others who could potentially take up the slack does not have access to the same markets this company had.  Someone is just not going to rush in here and solve this problem.  We need to consider the possibility that there might be a future for TLT or something similar.  It is quite obvious that this will leave a big hole in the market.  Regardless of the product, if fewer people are vying to buy it, the price will obviously be affected. <\/p><p>  When did representatives of the IFA and TLT last meet?  Has the IFA made a serious effort to sort this out?  One of the main purposes of this meeting is to ensure this does not happen again.  One way to ensure this does not go wrong again is by opening up access to the UK markets.  There seems to be an animal welfare problem in transporting animals on a ferry to Britain while there seems not to be a problem bringing them on a ferry all the way to Cherbourg.  If there are concerns about a short journey, why are there not concerns about a very long journey?  Last night I spent about three hours with the owners of TLT.  As far as they are concerned, if the markets to Britain were opened up, the company's shipping costs for last year would have been reduced from &euro;1.5 million to about &euro;900,000.  That &euro;600,000 would have made a massive difference to it.  What are the farming organisations doing to open this potentially phenomenal market for the live trade?

There is a major concern that our marts find themselves in a difficult financial situation.  Ultimately as outlined, the preferential creditors, whoever they are, will be key.<\/p><p>  In the longer term there is very big concern over the loss of competition in the cattle and sheep sectors.  The export of live weanlings to Italy had been a very important aspect of our beef trade and had a positive impact on the prices our factories were paying due to demand.  Any break in a link of that chain is of concern.  We need some analysis of how this happened and how TLT was run.  We need to know if TLT made any large capital investments prior to the receivership that would have put pressure on its cashflow.  If so were those capital investments in this jurisdiction?

Obviously this will result in a tightening of credit.  The Property Registration Authority was mentioned.  What exactly is required by that?  Obviously a tightening of credit would protect farmers or marts at the very least.  However, it also creates difficulty for farmers.  Most people who sell cattle, including me, have obtained short periods of credit.  It would be difficult to get rid of credit completely without it inconveniencing people who buy and sell cattle at Sixmilebridge, Ennis, Kilmallock or any of the major marts in the west.<\/p><p>  Will export credit insurance apply to any calves or cattle that have been exported outside the Union, including to north Africa?  If not I presume there is no obstacle.  Obviously export insurance is an obstacle for exports within the Union, but when it is outside I do not imagine it would be an obstacle.  There would be a lien over the cattle until they are paid for, but the difficulty would be tracing or finding those cattle.  Given the increased level of traceability - obviously all cattle have ear tags, etc. - is there scope for a mechanism within the European Union so that if cattle go from one member state to another one and have not been paid for, it could be registered?  At least then when the cattle are finally slaughtered there might be a mechanism of recovering moneys.  Is that completely na&iuml;ve given the possibility of switching tags?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100008#J00500","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1385033700,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives of the organisations for attending.  As there will be more cases such as the TLT one, governance needs to be considered.  Agribusiness has changed in recent years.  We applied credit liberally across the agribusiness area, including in the sector I am in.  However, that does not happen anymore.  That period of adjustment was very difficult because we were telling people we knew well that we could not get extra credit and so could not pass on extra credit.  It was difficult to do.  If credit is applied now, it is being applied very strictly and those receiving it are being asked difficult questions.  They are being asked for a guarantee from their bank that they are good for the credit.  Appearances do not merit anything anymore.  A business, including a mart, cannot become a bank.  Farmers or marts selling on the goods have the responsibility to establish that there is a reasonable chance of getting paid.<\/p> <p>There cannot be a dribble-down effect.  The farmer down the line from those who sell abroad should not be the one to be caught because he or she has not been part of it.  <\/p><p> What bad debt provisions are in place for marts?  What are the amounts of bad debts, in percentage terms, which have been written off in the past three years?  Are customers asked to provide credit guarantees from their banks?  Is work done to ensure a decision to provide credit is correct?  Those asking a bank for a loan will go through a lot of hoops before they get the money.  It should not be assumed one should receive credit just because it has always been the done thing.<\/p><p> It was mentioned that marts were competing on the level of credit given and that this was quite dangerous.  The marts are becoming a banking service and are not dealing with their core business.  Liberal credit will distort the price in the marketplace.  It happened in the property sector.  When those who do not have equity or substance behind them can have cash flow to compete in the marketplace because of the availability of credit, it will bring it down like a house of cards.  I am concerned about this.  Mr. Bryan mentioned price competition.  Marts need to have a policy on credit across the board.  Perhaps legislation is required.  We cannot have one mart doing better than another based on the availability of credit because it is building a bubble which will hurt farmers.  <\/p><p> We must distinguish between good will and reckless trading.  Reckless trading hurts everybody.  Neither the mart nor the primary producer can afford to take losses in this day and age.  We cannot use Government credit insurance to cover bad practices.

I have also raised the issue in the House, with the bank and the Italian authorities.  There is no doubt this is a complex issue.  It is not simple and will not be simple to solve.  Everyone who has contributed agrees on this point.  The biggest challenge is trying to maximise the money we can get from the Italian trade debtors.  That must be the objective, to try to ensure unsecured debtors, in particular farmers and marts, get as much money back as possible.<\/p><p>  We have an indication that approximately 30 marts are owed money.  Have the three farming organisations been contacted by many individual farmers who are in financial difficulty?  In Roscommon there has been a history of IOUs which have had a devastating impact on individual families.  Will the delegates give us some idea of what we are speaking about?  How can we influence the flow of moneys due back into Ireland from Italy?  It is not relevant now with regard to this company, but how do we provide for the retention of title across EU member states?  Deputy McNamara raised a similar question.  I have raised this issue with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and it is washing its hands of it, stating it is not its problem.  I have also been in contact with the Italian authorities through the Italian embassy.  They are also washing their hands of the issue, stating it is the Irish consulate in Italy which must deal with it.

In fairness, it must be acknowledged TLT opened up a new market in Italy which had not been easily accessible to Irish exporters.  Has the receiver given an explanation as to why he went down the receivership rather than the examinership route?  The elephant in the room is the fact we can ship cattle to Benghazi, but we cannot ship them to Birmingham.  If we were owed these debts in Manchester, it would be far easier to collect them than having to go to Milan to collect them, which is a big part of the problem.  On this bigger issue, it is not, as we know, as simple as an animal welfare issue across the Irish Sea.  If it was, we could get around it.  There are complex issues in the United Kingdom with regard to having our animals slaughtered, processed and placed on supermarket shelves there.  Will the delegates elaborate on the steps we need to take, as members of the committee, the Oireachtas and the Government to ensure this market is opened up.  There is a premium market.  Why in God's name must we send cattle to north Africa when we should be able to send them across the Irish Sea where there is a deficit with regard to the volume of beef produced and a premium market available to us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100009#K00300","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1385034300,"counter":559,"content":"<p>A few specific points were raised, particularly with regard to who appointed the receiver, credit requirements and trade debtors.

My understanding is this was done by HSBC but that technically AIB joined in the receivership.  I imagine that would be the description and that the lead appointee was HSBC.  I am to a degree pessimistic about the outcome of the receivership process for the marts, but, in truth, we will not know until the receiver is able to forensically identify the extent of the debt and the ability to collect the receivables.<\/p> <p>He is on record as saying the north African creditors are largely government creditors and that the debts are collectable.  He is also on record as indicating there is some uncertainty about the collection of Italian debt.  There is no clarity in that regard.  From the perspective of marts and farmers owed money, there are many issues of concern to us.  <\/p><p> I will ask the chairman of the marts committee to respond to the question of credit policy generally and the secretary to respond to the question on the constraints in export of livestock to the United Kngdom, which is an issue at which we have looked.  <\/p><p> On Senator Susan O'Keeffe's question about rationalisation initiatives, at a high level we produce a rationalisation strategy every seven to eight years.  At a micro level, we never stop socialising the idea of achieving consolidation between marts.  The most substantial recent consolidation is approximately eight or nine years old.  It involved the consolidation of three marts in Tipperary into Central Auctions.  If there is any advertisement for the success and merits of and efficiencies achieved by consolidation, this is one incidence.  There are other marts that are managers of multiple sites.  It is generally recognised there are efficiencies derived from consolidation.  <\/p><p> I will ask the chairman to comment on the issue of credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100009#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus O'Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385034900,"counter":564,"content":"<p>We have spent a great deal of time on the issue of credit, including speaking to members on the reason there should be a no credit policy.  If operators in the business of exporting cannot obtain sufficient facilities from their banks to carry on their businesses, where banks have access to their securities and know everything about them, why should marts give them credit?  This has been an issue of serious concern for us for a number of years.<\/p><p>  Deputy McNamara raised questions about the PRSA and credit.  In licensing any mart the main concern and requirement of the PRSA is that the client account be in credit at all times.  There cannot be a deficit at any time.  This means that if a mart does business to the tune of &euro;500,000 on any auction day, it must have &euro;500,000 in its client accounts before issuing cheques.  Obviously, any mart that has afforded credit to a company or any other customer will have done so in the full knowledge that it can withstand the consequences.  All livestock marts - I speak definitively about co-operative livestock marts - are managed by boards or committees of management made up of responsible mature people who would not give credit to any customer if they thought they could not withstand it.  We have been extremely concerned about this issue and will continue to enforce the stance that there has to be a no credit policy.  That is how it should be.  <\/p><p>  Reference was made to the fact that a customer was paying &euro;50 over the odds for stock.  Why should that customer be afforded a credit line when an ordinary farmer client wishing to purchase stock is required to pay before collecting the stock and leaving the mart?  It is totally unfair.  <\/p><p>  With regard to credit insurance, we investigated this issue a number of years ago.  The reality is that putting credit insurance in place for anyone dealing with a mart would cost more than what the mart would get in commission.  A mart putting in place credit insurance would be a non-runner.  <\/p><p>  To put matters in context, the main topic of the 37 meetings held from January 2009 to 9 October last was credit.  We have been and remain very concerned about this issue.  <\/p><p>  The question was asked as to the reason the HSBC had appointed a receiver.  It is fairly well known that the company concerned was operating on the basis of invoice discounting and that the bank was aware of its exposure.  My understanding from the receiver is that in the past four to six months it was not meeting its commitments.  For this reason, the bank had to become involved.  I do not think it came as a surprise when it moved when it did.  It might have been better for many of us if the bank had moved sooner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100010#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Spellman"},{"type":"speech","time":1385034900,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Doyle like to comment on the policy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100010#L00300","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385034900,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I would like to comment on the situation in the United Kingdom.  We have investigated this issue on numerous occasions.  We first investigated it three years ago.  As recently as three months ago, we went to England to reignite the UK trade.  Prior to the advent of EU Regulation 1760\/2000, hundreds of thousands of animals were shipped live to the United Kingdom, in respect of which no issue arose.  Irish cattle were much sought after in the United Kindom.  Implementation of the regulation and various statutory instruments at national level has greatly hindered that trade.  Because of labelling issues, cattle born in Ireland and subsequently shipped to England or Scotland lose their identity.  They become nomads.  Under the regulations, the sellers of this beef, the multiples, etc., can no longer call it Irish or UK beef and it ends up being sold at discount prices to the catering trade.  That is a problem.  The labelling issue has begun to hinder trade.  As stated earlier, it would be much easier from a credit point of view to travel to the United Kingdom by aeroplane or boat to collect a debt in respect of which a problem has arisen.<\/p><p>  The second impediment is that a handful of Irish companies involved in the slaughter of Irish cattle are also involved in the slaughter of a sizeable proportion of UK cattle.  They will actively resist any feed lot owner in the United Kingdom buying large quantities of Irish born cattle and finishing them.  Perhaps it is an issue of market segmentation from their point of view and that of the multiples.  During our trip to the United Kingdom three months ago we obtained photographic evidence which indicates that Irish beef - cattle born, raised and slaughtered in an Irish plant and subsequently sold to a UK multiple - and British beef - cattle born, raised and slaughtered in England - are being sold at the same price per kilo, yet there is an almost a &euro;200 difference between the price Irish and British farmers are getting.  Normal economics of supply and demand override these difficulties and we see sizeable amounts of Irish cattle being sold and finished in England.  However, the impediment in this regard is EU legislation.  Perhaps with the assistance of the committee and the Government, a bilateral arrangement between Ireland and the United Kingdom could be put in place.  Currently, it is easy for players in the market, either Irish processors or multiples here or in England, to hide behind an EU regulation, thus interfering with the economics of supply and demand.  <\/p><p>  The British sector can only meet 55% of its beef needs.  Ireland exports 80% of the beef it produces.  In other words, we produce 500,000 tonnes of beef, of which 260,000 tonnes is exported to the United Kingdom in carcase form.  We are then forced to find export markets for the remainder - alive or dead.  All of these problems are linked.  Our exporters have to find different countries to which to export, in respect of which the need for credit difficulties may arise, including, as mentioned, north Africa and Italy.  Farmers in Ireland are being forced to find markets for live and dead cattle, one of the pivotal points which solidifies in the credit issue being discussed.  The issue I have highlighted is a major one that needs to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100010#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ray Doyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1385034900,"counter":567,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Doyle for his response which gives a fair indication of what is going on.

We have put a lot of effort into the UK, meeting representatives of Irish Ferries and P&amp;O over recent months.  There is a higher concern, rather than awareness, of live exports in England.  We have a very steady trade of more than 300,000 animals, with some going to the UK and many going to Northern Ireland.  A substantial number of those animals go to Europe.  The Chairman referred to the African trade, which is much better regulated.  Quinn International had three boats of animals for export earlier this year, and not one animal leaves the port until the cheque is lodged.  There is a simple policy as the ship stays in the port until the money is received.  The company is dealing with a state agency but the ship does not leave until the cheque is lodged, as otherwise the guarantee of payment is dodgy.<\/p><p>  The UK is our nearest market and I have met representatives of Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda.  The representatives of Tesco told me if I rocked the boat in advocating Irish beef, it would purchase less than the &euro;300 million of Irish beef it purports to buy.  Our biggest single customer told us it did not want Irish cattle going to England to be slaughtered as it upset the National Farmers Union.  It is a delicate balance.  Deputy Naughten asked the very good question of what we can do.  The visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland last year was very helpful, as is the Irish President's upcoming visit to Britain.  The closer the two countries get, the better the amalgamation of market.  We will be able to get Tesco to be happy to put an Irish flag on beef packaging, as today it wants to put the Union Jack or the red tractor on such products for a premium price.  Collectively, we must achieve a better relationship through closer ties.<\/p><p>  There are four impediments to this, with the first being labelling legislation.  There is also shipping, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has highlighted this issue on several occasions.  I am amazed when I meet representatives of P&amp;O and Irish Ferries because they ask who will indemnify the service if there is a protest at the destination.  That does not happen on this side.  The UK would love to have a live export trade but it cannot have it because of the fear of animal rights lobbies, which are stronger in the UK than they are in this country.  Retailers are the biggest impediment, and last of all are the colleague farming organisations, which have on a couple of occasions lately gone to retailers to throw Irish cheddar and beef on the ground.  Colleagues in France were protesting about Irish cheddar and beef in McDonald's.  There is always a delicate balance between maximum market access and not getting a reaction that causes damage.<\/p><p>  The Deputy summed up the concerns of farmers very clearly, especially the viability of individual farmers.  I met a farmer from Monaghan who is owed &euro;45,000 and one from Limerick who is owed &euro;25,000.  The cattle in question were called a few days before the receiver went in and collected from the farm.  There are mart managers who spent five and six weeks telephoning the directors of TLT International.  They would not answer the calls because they had cancelled cheques.  There is a serious concern about this.  I am a director of a mart and as a director of any business, as Deputy Barry knows, one has a responsibility to ensure anything that is purchased is paid for.  No mart director should allow a mart trade unless he or she is 100% sure the cattle will be paid for.  I have made that clear to the directors of TLT International, which has a clear responsibility.  They purchased cattle when they knew they had massive debts of &euro;10 million and assets of only perhaps &euro;4 million, and some of them difficult to collect in Italy.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked the simple question of how the farmers will get paid.  We need goodwill from the receiver and debtors in Italy, as well as a certain amount from TLT International.  At the meeting with representatives of the company, we were told it did not own the yard or trucks and was unwilling to put any money into the process.  It is unacceptable for people who purchased cattle to argue they own nothing and add nothing to the party.  The directors have a responsibility to put in money to pay farmers owed money.  Another shipper called Seamus Purcell was in a similar position and he sold a farm to pay the farmers.  When Sallyview Estates, a company related to TLT, went broke, it had no corporate responsibility but it paid the farmers affected.  It will be difficult but I spent four years to get that money for farmers.  The receiver did not get paid and, unfortunately, the Revenue Commissioners did not get paid, but the farmers were paid.  There is an opportunity that can be based on goodwill, as the company will not trade again unless farmers are paid.  It is a fact that if a company wants to do business in Ireland, it must pay for the stock or not do business at all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100011#M00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1385035500,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Deputy Heydon asked if there is any indication that TLT made significant purchases or investments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100011#M00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385035500,"counter":570,"content":"<p>That is a job for the receiver.

Many of the issues arise from whether there is a political will to ensure there is an export market in future.  There must be a policy at Government level to ensure there is competition between factories, marts and exports in order that a farmer who is producing a quality product can sell that quality product.  The first striking thing about TLT International being gone is that many thousands of animals will not be exported next year.  Next autumn thousands of animals will have nowhere to go, so it will be a field day for factories to name their price.  As we see every year, when there is an excess of supply, prices drop quite quickly.<\/p><p>  The crux of this is whether a policy can be introduced at Government level to ensure there is a viable export industry.  We have heard the responses at this meeting, but we need concrete proposals for the future.

It is laid out clearly in the law, as has been emphasised several times, that the bank hires a receiver and the receiver gets paid first.  Naturally, the bank will get paid, so the marts and the farmers are at the bottom rung of the ladder.  That is a disaster.  I do not believe it can be changed because that is the law.<\/p> <p> With regard to exports, particularly into the UK, it is amazing that no boat leaves the Republic of Ireland to transport livestock to the UK.  We have constantly and intensively lobbied various ferry companies here to provide a ferry service.  They are a little bit worried about animal rights issues in the UK which is a problem but one never knows unless one tries.  Exports and the opening of gateways should be strongly pushed by the Ministry.  It is a scandal that to transport calves or weanlings from Cahirciveen in Kerry to the south of England, one must first travel all the way to Larne in Belfast.<\/p><p> The feed lots in England want our cattle.  There is a problem with labelling issues and the supermarkets, as some people on this side of the room referred to earlier.  Those issues can be overcome because the feed lots in the UK want Irish livestock due to the scarcity of animals in the UK.  We must address those issues.  We have talked to the farming unions and supermarkets in the UK about the matter.  There may be a way around the matter but it will take a little more work.  To help us on our way we need a big push by the Irish Government.<\/p><p> With regard to the closure of TLT International, we must first establish a task force to ensure that it never happens again and to protect the weanling trade.  Between 80,000 and 90,000 farmers produce weanling calves and every one of them will be affected by the closure.  We also need competition in the marketplace.  All one must do is look at what happened with Irish beef in the UK.  One individual involved in the meat industry here, controls the markets in the UK, mainland Europe and South America.  We do not want to see all of the markets go the same way.  In order for farming to survive, particularly weanling exports, we must export from Ireland.  We must get people who are involved in the industry together, learn what their problems are and find a solution. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100013#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabriel Gilmartin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385036700,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late but I heard some of the contributions.  Obviously the TLT closure is a significant issue that affected the part of the country that I come from.  The placing of TLT International into receivership has sent shivers through the wider agricultural community and a significant element of competition has been removed.  I concur with the view that with factories being dominant it could act as an impetus for them to return to their bad old ways.  It is essential that all of the stakeholders sit down with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to work out appropriate mechanisms to ensure that marketplace competition is restored.  That is critical.<\/p><p>  Mr. Paul Smyth mentioned an export insurance.  I remember examining the idea when I was spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment so I know it is not a simple matter.  Nevertheless it should be explored.  One of the problems with perishable goods is that retention of title clauses are ephemeral and do not mean anything.  The retention of title for a durable product, and where one can follow through, can give sustenance and comfort.  In this instance, it is not available.  Even if one were to explore the matter I do not think it would be an option.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Naughten and I may have referred to winning back the moneys lost by the Italian situation.

Nevertheless the marts have been prudent over the years and should be able to absorb the loss.  That is a very healthy situation to be in and I salute them.  However, marts cannot afford to take anything for granted.  <\/p><p>  It appears that the only significant asset of TLT is its level of trade debtors.  Obviously marts, farmers and haulage contractors have been significantly impacted.  The company employed 25 workers but also provided a lot of indirect work.  A number of significant creditors have also suffered the impact in terms of all sorts of supplies.  Have the organisations explored the possibility of an export insurance scheme with the Minister?  Have they suggested assembling all of the relevant stakeholders to ensure competition?  <\/p><p>  I noticed that the IFA said it spoke to the receiver last week.  Deputy Naughten and I spoke to other people at the same time.  Have further discussions been held with the receiver to see if progress has been made?

Bord Bia can play a role.  I shall quote Bord Bia.  Having read the quote it seems undecided as to whether to enter the British market.  Mr. Aidan Cotter, head of Bord Bia, said:<blockquote>We have always been discussing with retailers in the UK about this around labelling.  British retailers have been reluctant to move that set up as it has been the convention used since BSE in 1996.  Ireland exports 50% of its beef into Britain and the other 50% goes into continental markets.  If we lose any of those premium markets because their prices are too high that would be a real dilemma for our farmers.  If our cattle prices rose to the UK level it would be very difficult for us to compete on the continent.  The UK is exporting, it is a deficit market.  If our prices rose to that level how could we possible compete? .... I do not think that it is in our best interest to focus on Britain.<\/blockquote>Those are the words spoken by the head of Bord Bia.<\/p><p>  Is it good?  Is it our future to go into Britain?  If it is, then what is the head of Bord Bia talking about?  It is one of Bord Bia's primary jobs to sort out labelling.  What has Bord Bia done about labelling?  What has the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine done about labelling?  If it is a good thing for us to get into the British market, then what is Bord Bia at?  <\/p><p>  I have a final question for Mr. John Bryan.  When did the IFA last contact TLT?  The documentation here says it was on Tuesday, 12 November.  What was the IFA's last contact with TLT?  What effort has been made to work with TLT to sort out the matter?

The law is an ass in terms of food labelling because a gross contradiction has been allowed to take place for two completely different types of product.<\/p><p>  I have a related question.

Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v supported this.  Should we propose legislation to the Commission to make it easier to trace cattle that have not been paid for and have been moved from one member state to another?  Inevitably, the animals will be killed and slaughtered.

If no credit was given to the people concerned, there would not be an issue.  The availability of redit has caused this problem, which is why marts find themselves caught for a sum in excess of &euro;3 million.  If people have sufficient facilities when trading, the mart will pay its client for the stock sold on any auction day.  If the individual who buys the stock pays for it, there will be no issue.  That is where we must focus our attention.  It is not economically possible to put credit insurance in place because marts operate on a commission rate of between 1.6% and 1.9%.  It would cost more than this to put credit insurance in place.  The PSRA will be helpful to us.  If individual farmers were to transact their business through marts, none of them would be caught because the responsibility is on the mart to pay them as individual clients who sell stock.  If the marts continue to do business in the way they have always done, they will not allow anyone credit.  We would then not have to go into the question of examining the traceability of stock leaving the country.  That might sound simplistic, but it is the way to go.<\/p><p>  From 2015, we will be out of the cheque regime, which will be helpful.

Before I am allowed to lift my hand, I must give my bank details to the mart.  I cannot just turn up in a mart in County Roscommon or County Kerry and buy cattle.  I must ring a few days beforehand and provide my bank account details in order that they can be cleared.  It is a good practice.<\/p><p>  Deputy Willie Penrose asked a few very good questions.  The most important point is on competition.  We need some competition.  The numbers of births have reduced by 100,000, whether dairy or beef cattle, while live exports are up by 50,000.  In 2014 there will be a major reduction in the suckler herd and we expect to be down by another 100,000.  That will put more pressure on the factories to pay for them.  Competition is essential and the life of all trade.  It is no good unless the lad lifting the hand is paying for the cattle.<\/p><p>  Retention of title works very well within countries and we have experience in the case of grain.  In cases where perishable products leave the country, we recently had the case of the Waterford chickens, in which farmers got badly burned.  Export insurance sounds like a simple solution, but the last time the Government looked at the issue, it would have lost &pound;500 million.  For the Government to underwrite a system under which I could sell to anyone, regardless of whether he or she could pay, sounds simple, but it would be reckless of it to do so.  European competition law and WTO regulations prohibit the Government from subsidising companies.  We are fighting with the Americans over the subsidising in which they are engaged.  The company involved pays 80% of the cost and the government subsidises it.  Europe is taking the United States to the WTO because it is illegal under international law to subsidise.  It tends to encourage reckless trading.<\/p><p>  We need prudent dealing.  Deputy Tom Barry spoke earlier.  There must be a tighter supply of cash and we must be careful about those to whom we give credit.  This applies to farmers and agribusiness.  It is putting pressure on the banking system and there is no easy fix.  The Minister, Bord Bia and farming organisations, particularly ICOS, have roles to play.  Bord Bia has staff in Italy and Spain.  Ms Cecelia Ruiz works in the Spanish office and if she was asked whether she would sell cattle to certain people, she would say she would not sell them chicken.  A prudent attitude in knowing about business is required.  John Keane works for Bord Bia in Italy and I do not know whether people ask him with whom they should do business.  I agree with those who suggested Bord Bia had a greater role to play in this regard.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's comment, we all agree that the British market is at our back door.  I have been a cattle farmer for many years and it was not always that way.  Japan and Italy were always the highest priced markets, but today it is the UK market.  Ten years ago a top quality heifer made more in Italy than anywhere else in the world.  Today England offers the best price.<\/p><p>  Why is there an animal welfare issue?  It is because well funded groups in England are absolutely against live exports to any level.  They played a part in stopping our live exports to north Africa.  They lobbied substantially in the European Parliament to bring export refunds to an end.  The day Ireland's exports to north Africa were stopped, they were replaced by Australian exports that had to travel for six or seven weeks when Irish cattle only had to travel for six days.  The animal rights groups are acting in a reckless fashion and it makes no sense.  Unfortunately, they are very well funded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100015#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Bryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1385037300,"counter":605,"content":"<p>What about Stranraer specifically, if they are that well funded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013112100015#Q00600","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385037300,"counter":606,"content":"<p>Stranraer is seen as a link within the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>Under UK legislation, it is seen as part of the UK.

However, there is something else going on at the moment which they know.  More than 70,000 cattle from the Republic of Ireland went to the North.  Someone asked the question about nomad cattle which became Northern Ireland cattle.  Northern Ireland cattle go to Scotland because they can get the red tractor.  There is a deficit of cattle in Scotland and England.  They can ship cattle from Northern Ireland and get the red tractor.  Our cattle cannot get the red tractor.  Deputy Naughten asked the question in great detail.  Ireland is one of the countries lobbying for clear traceability.  Yesterday, I held a press conference in which we complained about foreign pork becoming Irish.  We are very clear about it and are saying born, reared and slaughtered in Ireland.  Those nomad cattle exist in Ireland at the moment.<\/p><p>  There was a very big market for calves last year and 20,000 to 30,000 UK calves came in.  They are finding it very hard to find homes at the moment because they cannot get quality assurance.  The rules are the same - born, reared and slaughtered in England or in Ireland.  Approximately, 70,000 Irish live animals go to Northern Ireland, which some people call the UK.  Some 250,000 lambs come from the North to the South.  <\/p><p>  I mention the amount of milk that comes from the North.  The expansion that took place in milk in the North over the past ten years could not have taken place without the Republic of Ireland.  What happened was that they had no quota and they expanded.  They had no no processing facilities, so that milk goes to Monaghan, Connacht Gold, Glanbia and Virginia.  The Deputy referred to the inter-relationship.  We are totally intertwined.  Cattle go up to the North and sheep and milk come down to the South.  The trouble is that we cannot get the red tractor when we sell in England.  I have sat down with the retailers.  If one goes to the south of Italy, there are local cattle or to the Limousin area of France, there are local products.<\/p><p>  There is a big row between Canada and the US over COOL, which is the American labelling system.  Canadian beef sells at a huge discount in America.  Every country in the developed world pays a premium for its own product.  Ireland is a big exporter and exports 90% of our beef and 85% of our dairy.  We are at a slight disadvantage and that is why we put such investment into Origin Green and quality assurance and having the same standards as the UK.

The issue of live exports is something to which we will have to come back.<\/p><p>  In regard to the credit policy for marts, I think Mr. Spellman laid it out pretty simply.

The Government, the Department and Bord Bia cannot afford to allow this to go.  The committee produced a report on the grocery sector which stated that consolidation and too few players in the market is bad for everybody, including the processor, the producer and, ultimately, the consumer.  The same applies to the markets for beef, which is the largest agricultural export we have.  <\/p><p>  Again, I thank the witnesses.

In the autumn of 2013 Europe is not in a particularly good space.  Unemployment across the eurozone averages 12%, while GDP in the second quarter was 3% below its pre-crisis trend.  Meanwhile, the ECB is limited in what it can do because its mandate emphasises fighting inflation, even though the spectre looming over Europe is deflation.<\/p><p>  The recent statements by Mr. Barroso and Mr. Van Rompuy on opening up a social space in the process for EMU are a late conversion almost on a par with St. Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus.  The only difference is that at least we knew St. Paul was sincere.  There is a view that the attachment of a few social indicators to the European semester process is a mere fig leaf and that current policy is to do the minimum in order that society does not break down altogether within the eurozone, while leaving the Internal Market to develop as a free trade area.<\/p><p>  The European system has changed since Ireland entered the bailout programme.  The world we are entering is one of budget surveillance, the European semester and country-specific recommendations.  Having failed to join the train when it left the platform because we were in the bailout programme, we will be hoisted into it as if by magic.  Bailout programme countries are exempt from this process, but as soon as we exited the bailout programme we entered into this process.  It is an intrusive process that would have been unimaginable in 2006, but it is infinitely preferable to the troika process.  In this context, we welcome any move to broaden the debate beyond the purely economic to the social because they are intrinsically linked.<\/p><p>  The debate on the social aspect of EMU will be undertaken partly in Dublin and partly in Brussels.  We operate through the European Trade Union Confederation, ETUC.  At its conference in Dublin last June the ETUC proposed a social compact for Europe that would set out a vision for the future in which fundamental social rights took priority over economic freedoms and that the European Union honour its treaty obligations to work for the improvement of living and working conditions of all its citizens.  It is vital that economic governance no longer be regulated purely by economic criteria such as deficits and public debt.  Prioritising these issues over all others has sparked the increase in poverty and inequality and furthered the erosion of public services, social protection and social relations.  In reality, economic and social factors are inseparably linked.  Social indicators are essential points of reference if we wish Economic and Monetary Union to proceed in a coherent and socially positive way.  The major problem, however, is that while these social indicators are a useful tool, they remain mere indicators.  They have no teeth and lack the power to change the direction of economic policies.  It is imperative that these social indicators carry weight in the development of economic policy.<\/p><p>  We are particularly concerned about social dumping and how some employers exploit cross-border workers.  I recently attended a meeting in the European Parliament on this issue and it seems that, owing to the actions of a small number of employers, Ireland is gaining an unsavoury reputation for sharp practice in the application of employment legislation.  The core of our problem is that we have an evolving eurozone economy with a Central Bank observing the narrow mandate of price stability at a time when Europe's main challenge is deflation.  The independence of the European Central Bank is not counterbalanced by any other European institution.  By contrast, under the Humphrey Hawkins Act of 1978, the US Federal Reserve is required to take on board the US Government's economic goals, together with achieving reasonable price stability.  Without easing up on the 2% inflation target, it is difficult to see how the European economy can be reflated and without reflation there are grim prospects for Europe's 25 million unemployed.  We need a more intensive debate at European level on a new mandate more akin to the mandate of the US Federal Reserve.<\/p><p>  The unpleasant truth of the matter is that EMU has removed currency devaluation from the toolkit of economic management.  In the absence of this tool, the devaluation which occurs is internal, as we have witnessed to our cost in recent years.  This imposes huge stresses on the fabric of society and these stresses are worsened by the policy straitjacket in which the ECB is placed.  It is often said the generals are always prepared to fight the last war.  In this case the ECB is mandated to fight the war of the 1970s and 1980s when the economy could have been better compared to that during the great depression of the 1920s and 1930s.  The paradox is that the special priority given to price stability requires European integration to proceed at the expense of provisions and redistributive functions in member states.  Welfare systems are a national competence and likely to remain so because, for example, the Scandinavians will never cede control of their welfare system to Brussels in the current circumstances.<\/p><p>  Compounding the dilemma is that the eurozone is about to embark on its most ambitious phase of economic integration at a time when support among EU citizens for the European project is at its lowest.  The citizens of creditor and debtor countries are up in arms for different reasons.  The True Finns, the Danish People's Party and Alternative F&uuml;r Deutschland are manifestations of \"not another cent\" Euroscepticism in creditor countries. Congress believes the opening of a genuine dialogue on the economic aspects of EMU is to be welcomed, provided it is dialogue to an end, not for its own sake.  A genuine social dialogue might help to revive the tarnished image of Europe among its citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney"},{"type":"speech","time":1385042400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>We will take all of the delegates together and then allow members to ask questions collectively, if that is agreeable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100003#B00400","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385043000,"counter":638,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, I thank the committee for this invitation.  I very much welcome the opportunity to make a presentation on the social dimension of the economic and monetary union, EMU.  As Ireland prepares for the troika to leave, it is increasingly clear that austerity is not leaving with them.  INOU is keenly aware that addressing the unemployment crisis in a smart, sustainable and inclusive manner will not be feasible unless alternative policies are developed and pursued.  This is a challenge not only at national level but also at European level.  The emphasis on strengthening the EMU's economic governance and multilateral surveillance has created a limited policy context in which social issues can be appropriately addressed.  The focus on tight fiscal controls is also throwing up economic challenges, for example the implications of dangerously low levels of investment in Ireland.<\/p><p>  At an individual level, economic and social issues are intertwined.  A critical question facing unemployed people is whether they have a realistic prospect of finding sustainable employment.  Unemployed people face the prospect of sanctions if they fail to take up the activation options presented to them.  The current scale of job creation is insufficient to give many of those who are now unemployed any meaningful options.  This is worsened by the fact that many unemployed people do not hear about employment options as many jobs are not advertised.  When jobs are advertised some employers can be reluctant to recruit people who are long-term unemployed.  These issues are not only personal but local, national and European, and addressing them at all these levels is critical.  How the perceptions of unemployed people and jobless households are articulated, the language used in public discourse, the policies devised and how they are implemented on the ground all influence potential outcomes and, in particular, whether they are equitable and inclusive.<\/p><p>  As a troika country Ireland was not subject to the full Europe 2020 process.  As the troika leaves, this process and its targets will become more pertinent.  Even with the revised and less ambitious poverty targets, introduced in light of the impact of austerity, Ireland is moving in the wrong direction.  According to the Survey on Income and Living Conditions 2011 consistent poverty had increased to 6.9% and for unemployed people this figure is considerably higher at 16.5%.  It is important that these targets are not just aspirational but are given real effect and are pursued with the urgency afforded to the economic and fiscal targets.  One potential way to give effect at a national level is to place inequality-proofing and poverty-proofing on a legislative basis.<\/p><p>  On the educational target, Ireland is moving in the right direction, but, as Ireland's structural unemployment problem indicates, we have a long way to go before addressing the challenges facing disadvantaged young people distant from the labour market.  An equally difficult challenge is the one facing older long-term unemployed people whose skill set does not match up with current or emerging job opportunities.  Welcome and essential as the youth guarantee is, in Ireland 87% of people who are long-term unemployed are aged over 25 and specific measures are required to address the issues facing older unemployed people, including discrimination.<\/p><p>  While welcoming the proposed increased focus on social issues within the economic and fiscal monitoring procedures in place in Europe, INOU is conscious of the challenge facing Europe.  For example, when the tight control envisaged under the macroeconomic imbalances procedure, MIP, are likely to prevent appropriate levels of social and economic investment to really tackle structural unemployment and those at risk of poverty and social exclusion.  In seeking to strengthen policy co-ordination will an economic focus invariably dominate a social one or will the learning drawn from the key employment and social indicators scoreboard be used to address the underlying structural issues which give rise to long-term unemployment, poverty and social exclusion?<\/p><p>  Without a strong focus on equality and policy and system design that strives to meet the needs of people living and working in Europe, there is a real danger that activation measures will fail unemployed people and others distant from the labour market.  It is also striking that Europe-wide progress on social policy will be assessed through, for example, the exchange of best practice through the open method of co-ordination, OMC, which is very different from the more enforceable and potentially draconian measures envisaged on the economic and fiscal policy side.<\/p><p>  A strong focus on active inclusion will be integral to developing a smart, sustainable and inclusive Europe; developing and deepening social cohesion within and across Europe; and realising the full potential of the social investment package, SIP.  Europe has defined active inclusion as: \"enabling every citizen, notably the most disadvantaged, to fully participate in society, including having a job.\"  There are three interlocking aspects to active inclusion: adequate income supports; inclusive labour markets; and access to quality services.  Access to adequate income supports and quality services are critical to addressing poverty and social exclusion.  They are also critical in supporting people who become unemployed to manage their unemployment and access an appropriate response.<\/p><p>  INOU is very concerned that the increasing focus on conditionality within and across Europe is undermining social protection supports and that elements within SIP that stress prevention rather than cure by reducing the need for benefits will leave an increasing number of people managing the personally unsustainable and impoverishing cycle of welfare and low paid precarious work.  Such a development will undermine solidarity at all levels of European society.  It also raises serious issues for labour market mobility and begs the question whether Europe is here for its people and the development of European society, or sees its people as an input into its economic development.<\/p><p>  Welcome as financial instruments such as the European Social Fund are, their potential is limited by co-financing matching requirements at a time of tighter EU fiscal rules.  The scale of the interventions required to address social issues, including structural issues such as long-term unemployment, requires increased national investment.  What appears more likely is a redesign of existing measures to meet particular needs with limited resources.<\/p><p>  It is critically important that any developments across Europe to strengthen the social dimension of the EU's focus and organisation explicitly include people who are living with and seeking to address unemployment and other forms of inequality and social exclusion.  The vision for growth within Europe 2020 is for growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive.  To develop and implement policies that underpin this vision, it is not only critical but smart to include the people who are often the objectives of policy developments.  The active participation of people living and working in Europe is critical to improving social cohesion and the creation of a Europe that is seen as meaningful to the lives of its inhabitants and citizens.<\/p><p>  Community and voluntary sector organisations, CVSOs and NGOs as social partners have an important role to play in social dialogue and in the articulation and development of inclusive policies and their implementation.  CVSOs and NGOs, like the traditional social partners, contribute to the roll-out, review and development of improved policy responses and good practice.  A key element of good practice is engaging with people who are unemployed and socially or economically excluded and drawing on their lived experience to develop better and more appropriate responses.  An integral part of such work is the provision of good quality information that facilitates people to make informed choices, and choice must be at the heart of activation and other policies.<\/p><p>  The communiqu&eacute; notes: \"A well-functioning monetary union requires flexible markets and appropriate institutions to address the social situation and provide adequate national safety nets.\"  It also requires that social policy be integral to European policy in the way economic and fiscal policy is.  It needs to strive to have at the heart of its policy development a strong and demonstrable commitment to equality and inclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100004#C00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1385043000,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Farrell.

Most people would be positive about its survival but, as noted earlier, there is a growing and strengthening resistance to much of what is going on.  I will step back and take a longer view to put this question into perspective.  EMU has been on the agenda a long time.  There have been three different understandings of how it could be delivered.  The first saw EMU as following from political union.  The second saw political union as following from EMU.<\/p> <p>The result is that we have a third approach which basically sees economic and monetary union being achieved through a series of procedural governance methodologies and a recalibration of social models to the point where the president of the European Central Bank could say last year that the European social model is dead.  He is still in office, which I find very interesting.  I do not think any government has supported that view.<\/p><p> The Maastricht Treaty, when it was implemented, led to an imbalance in the institutional structure for economic and monetary union.  In the 1990s and the 2000s, these imbalances were corrected in a number of ways.  All across Europe we saw the development of social pacts in member states.  In Ireland, that took the form of the social partnership process.  A lot of strategies were put in place at a European level to deal with the social dimension.  We saw the development of the European social dialogue, the European employment strategy, the Lisbon strategy, the open method of co-ordination in the fields of pensions, health and a variety of other areas.  In a way then, economic and monetary union had a substantial social dimension to it, even if it was weak, contradictory and, in many cases, fragile.  However, in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent euro crisis, this social dimension has been steadily eroded.  Some would argue that it was being eroded from 2004 onwards but that is a debatable point.  The open methods of co-ordination, for example, which were used in a variety of different ways were gradually voided of any substance.  The European social dialogue was no longer fed and the social goals of the Lisbon strategy were neglected.  In fact, the strategy was eventually split in two and the social aspects put to one side.  Few European legislative initiatives were taken in the social policy field.  <\/p><p> The new approach is already putting more pressure on industrial relations, for example, in terms of wages and decentralisation.  It is putting pressure on the welfare state, for example, on issues like labour market policy, pensions, welfare rates and so forth.  Member states have put major programmes in place to reduce public expenditure and to introduce structural reforms.  Austerity has become the order of the day.  However, the austerity approach is based on an inaccurate analysis of what actually happened in 2007\/2008.  The popular understanding of what happened is very well articulated by Angela Merkel.  She suggested that the causes of the crisis were twofold - catastrophic profligate drift in public finances and excessive national debt built up over many years.  The argument basically was that because countries had allowed huge drifts in their public finances, had borrowed enormously, way beyond their means and had allowed their national debt to run to dangerous levels, austerity was necessary.  That led to reductions in social expenditure and social services and to the financial sector being fully repaid for the loans and so on.  Banking debt became sovereign debt and increased supervision of public finances became the order of the day.  Sanctions were put in place for countries which missed their fiscal targets.  The fiscal compact, the two-pack and the six-pack were put into place, the terms of which will be the order of the day here once we exit the bailout.  The ongoing dominance of the financial sector was one of the responses to the crisis.<\/p><p> However, we have a question.  Was the initial analysis of the cause of the crisis valid?  Was it accurate?  Did Ireland, for example, borrow way in excess of what it should have been borrowing in the decade up to 2007?  In actual fact, Ireland ran a budget surplus every single year, bar one, in the ten years up to 2007.  It ran a deficit in 2002.  It is not true to say that Ireland had allowed a catastrophic profligate drift in its public finances.  The second question is whether we allowed excessive national debt to build up over many years.  In 2007 our debt to GDP ratio was one of the lowest in the world.  I would suggest, therefore, that what we are looking at here is a misunderstanding of the problem.  The causes being addressed are not the causes of the problem so the solution being applied is addressing the wrong issue.  What actually happened was that the financial industry, including banks and bondholders, had run riot.  They had gambled to an extraordinary degree and certainly we had a degree of responsibility as a country because we did not regulate the industry properly.  However, we were not pumping in the money or driving it.  Certainly, at Government level, Ireland did not engage in any of the activities to which Ms Merkel referred.  An appropriate response would have been proper regulation, a financial transactions tax, the elimination of tax havens, a tackling of financial fraud, the separation of commercial and investment banking and a variety of other things.  <\/p><p> The problem is that at European level,  we have been focusing on tackling the wrong cause.  As a result, we have structural unemployment, rising poverty levels, sustained child poverty, ongoing adult literacy challenges, high net emigration, lengthening social housing waiting lists and declining social infrastructure.  In fact, the latter is being eroded.  We would suggest that, in terms of the social dimension of what is happening, this is a road to nowhere.  The process of developing economic and monetary union is producing a one-sided and ultimately unviable system.  The social component is being undermined.  An austerity approach is being imposed which insists that, for example, the cost of health care and pension systems should be reduced; that wage formation systems should be placed within a competitive framework with little respect for those on low incomes and the working poor; that social benefits systems create disincentives to labour market participation and so must be reduced, as if, in some way, reducing welfare rates creates jobs, which does not happen; and that labour costs must be reduced.  There may be some structural reforms required in each of those areas but to basically argue that this should be done to get our house in order because these issues were the cause of the crisis is simply to misunderstand the reality and to put an incorrect solution in place.  This approach has little or no interest in how social models are intended to reduce inequality and to supply assistance and protection nor does it acknowledge how social models could contribute to the operation of a regulated monetary economy.  That is why this is a critical discussion.  This is not just about putting social indicators into place.  It is about making the social dimension a central component of the European project.  We should be developing economic and monetary union with this social dimension at its core.  We would argue that until these issues are adequately addressed, economic and monetary union will continue to have a corrosive impact on social services, social provision and the social infrastructure that underpins much activity in our societies.  If economic and monetary union is to have a genuinely supportive social component, these are the issues that must be addressed and the current dominant negative trends must be reversed.  <\/p><p> In our submission to the committee, we have spelled out in some detail, a five-pillar framework that we believe should be at the core of European development.  Economic and monetary development is part of that, but so too is social development.  The five pillars need to be addressed simultaneously and not in a linear fashion.  We need macroeconomic stability and a just taxation system.  We need social protection and the social infrastructure to be strengthened rather than weakened.  We need real, effective governance, particularly in terms of issues like policy analysis and so forth.  Finally, we need sustainability to be put at the core of the policy-making process. Those are the five dimensions that need to be put in place.  When making proposals, suggestions, submissions and so forth to the Commission and the Council about the social dimension of economic and monetary union, these five elements need to be knitted together into a coherent tapestry and all five need to be addressed simultaneously and in solidarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385043600,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their opening presentations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100005#D00200","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1385044200,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I welcome the three delegations and thank them for the papers they have presented.  I agree with Dr. Rigney that the social dimension to monetary union appears to be an afterthought.  In the past two years when we faced crises, it was all about the markets and stabilising the euro rather than asking about their impact on society and people.  I am not foolish enough to think the issue can be resolved in isolation, but it would have been nice in some of the communiqu&eacute;s to acknowledge the people impacted on by these monetary problems.  However, it seems it is all about rectifying the markets to allow them to do what they best do, which is to follow greed and generate profits for some people, while the citizens are just minions.<\/p><p>  There is a challenge ahead to forge the social agenda in the minds of those who are dictating the state of play.  How do the delegations see their organisations interfacing to a greater extent in trying to ensure the voices of those most affected are taken into account?  Some of the labour activation measures in place are ineffective.  With such a large number unemployed, how can we put in place labour activation measures to ensure people do not go off at the deep end?

I agree with many of their views, but, equally, I strongly disagree with many of them, as Fr. Healy will attest from past experience.<\/p><p>  When the economy collapsed, we had to start somewhere.  Putting the house in order was one of the things that needed to be done.  This is no longer a closed economy, protected by tariffs.  We have to trade and to trade in the market, we had to put the basic fundamentals in order.  From 2002, I was raising questions in this House as to whether the economic fundamentals were in order.  They were not.  One Minister famously replied to the effect that they were not.  We refused, however, as a nation to accept reality.  As long as everything appeared to be going well, we went for it.  Unfortunately, we reaped the benefits of that approach.  Unfortunately, too, those less privileged in society are the ones who pay most in these situations.  When economic crises occur, it is the poor, the less well-off and those at the bottom of the social agenda who pay the highest price.  That is in the nature of things.  We do not have the resources to protect them at this time.<\/p><p>  Today the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform informed me at Question Time that he was &euro;1 billion below the expenditure figue by the end of October, despite having fewer people working in the public sector.  This did not come without sacrifice but at great cost to the people and it is to be hoped the economy will reap the whirlwind of benefits.  It was our inability to take corrective measures in time which brought us to where we were several years ago.  We got there by ridiculousness and not noticing the indicators.  As a result, many of the people have suffered.<\/p><p>  I agree with the points made by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, but how we deal with them is where we differ.  I am one of those with a strong social conscience.  It grieves many of us greatly to find ourselves where we are.  It is not a question of ignoring people&rsquo;s concerns, the fact that they have been under severe stress and are in debt.  It is a fact of life about which we can do very little.<\/p><p>  I have had many of these conversations with Fr. Healy duirng the years and neither of us has changed.  I disagree with his analysis because it flies in the face of what I suggested at the beginning was the cause of our problem - refusing to accept reality and take action.  Action taken at an earlier stage would have made a huge difference to the extent to which the people have had to suffer what is now called austerity.  It is the wrong name for it.  It should be called good housekeeping, with very few resources.  A Minister said in 2007 that there was too much money in the country and that the then Government did not need all of the money available.  Why?  It was coming from the construction sector, with its massive inflation rate and house prices increasing by 500% in seven years.  That is what Angela Merkel has been talking about.  The market, regardless of whether one likes it, takes cognisance of the stability of the economy.  As we do not have control over is, unfortunately, we are vulnerable.  I agree with Fr. Healy on the issue of regulation.  However, regulation after the event is no good.  People talk about bondholders and foreign banks, but this is about money borrowed by someone in this country from foreign banks who presumed there would be no need to pay it back.  That is not done.  Again, however, the ones who have paid the price are the unfortunate individuals at the bottom of the social scale, families and poorer people.<\/p> <p>I have no problem with the financial transaction tax.  Maybe Dr. Healy and I agree more than ever before.  It could happen.  The financial transaction tax must be accepted and applied by everybody.  It is no good one country doing it.  Financial services in this country, and all that goes with it, would be gone in the morning if we applied it alone.  I understand the counter-argument on that.<\/p><p> I worry a little about the elimination of tax havens because in recent times a few people who have visited this country have referred to tax havens in this country.  This may not be what Dr. Healy is referring to, but they have criticised the way we do things suggesting we operate tax havens here, but nothing could be further from the truth.  It has been very damaging to this country's reputation abroad.  Some companies which are not manufacturing or making a profit in this country reroute their profits through this and other European countries, and have been doing that for years with encouragement.<\/p><p> The need to tackle financial fraud goes without saying.  I am shocking myself with the extent to which I agree with Dr. Healy, and I know I am shocking him.  We do not have to go into all that.  We accept it all.  On the separation of commercial and investment banking, the two are a little interlinked and interdependent and one cannot always do the one.  The length of social housing waiting lists is very dear to my heart.  Dr. Healy will remember 15 years ago across a board room table I indicated to him that this would become the most important issue in this country in the future.  I do not know if he agreed with me at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100006#E00200","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385044800,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100007#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1385044800,"counter":649,"content":"<p>There was no problem then but there is now.

My organisation conducted the first ever study on the impact of austerity measures on the five programme countries at risk, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain.  That was published in February.  We are completing an updated version which includes Cyprus and Romania because we wanted to take in a country that was not in a good space but was not in the traditional western European social model.  The same kind of approach was used in all the countries in pushing austerity.  There were some differences, for example although Italy has a substantially higher total tax take than Ireland, its adjustments were accepted and involved a &euro;2 increase in taxation for every &euro;1 in cuts.  That was decided by the Italian Government and accepted by the troika, the bottom line being that it had to reduce its borrowing each year.<\/p><p>  We have maintained this position all along.  We have met the troika on most of its visits here over the last three years and they have constantly told us they do not decide what the proportional base should be but that they insist only that the overall target should be reached.  Speaking at our conference on Tuesday, the leader of the troika in Ireland over recent years, Dr. Istvan Szekely from the European Commission, made that point.  That is in the publication.  There is an issue there.  We have seen huge increases in poverty and huge impacts in unemployment and social services being eroded.  A very serious set of issues must be addressed in Ireland and across other European countries.  We continue to analyse that.<\/p><p>  We are strongly of the view that without investment there will be no jobs, without jobs there will be no recovery, and without recovery we will be stuck in austerity, so investment is critical.  We must do this investment in a different way from just borrowing money as a State because we are already maxed out.  My organisation has produced a policy briefing on how this could be done with a special purpose vehicle which the Government is using and has used in other contexts over the years.  The point is to generate an additional &euro;7 billion over three years to do the kind of investment the Government is talking about, but over a much longer term.<\/p><p>  We found, in discussions with the Department of Finance, that the ECB is setting rules that try to block us from doing this.  We have to pay back the money to the ECB and that is fine.  Our proposal would have created approximately 65,000 jobs.  Many of those people would come off the live register and would save the Government social welfare expenditure.  Those people would pay tax, increasing Government revenue.  We calculated the total benefit would be approximately &euro;2.9 billion.  For some reason the ECB has a rule that says we could not use that money to pay off that debt.  With due respect, where is the social dimension of EMU with that totally arbitrary rule?  That is the information we get from the leadership of the Department of Finance.  It is a simple example of the problem we face.<\/p><p>  I could say much about Deputy Durkan's comments, but I will not.  I am happy he supports a financial transactions tax.  We should be prepared to go with it if ten or 12 countries, particularly the bigger ones, go with it, and they are prepared to do so.  We half agree on that.  I want to address this analogy of us as a prudent household.  Let us take a normal household and examine what it would do to be prudent.  They pay their bills every year.  They have only small debts and would be well able to pay them off over a relatively short period of time.  The Irish Government did that up to 2007.  It paid its way and had a budget surplus in all but one of the previous ten years and kept its national debt to GDP ratio at one of the lowest levels in the world.<\/p><p>  The local bank manager of this household did serious gambling in his own business and ran up big debt.  His solution was to transfer that debt to the household and let them pay it.  That is exactly what has happened, and so the analysis is wrong because it protects the banker who gambled.  We argue that the burden should have been shared.  We must take responsibility for having poor regulation, so it will cost us a certain amount, but the bankers and bondholders who were gambling should never have got all their money back.<\/p> <p>That is the fundamental error.

A common theme running through the three presentations is how integral social policy should be to the European project.  Deputy Timmy Dooley mentioned jobs, which are at the heart of this issue.  A range of services and supports can be put in place and it is vital that they are, but they must lead to work for people.  That is key.  Investment in job creation at European level must be a priority; nationally it will also be very important.  There is a need for quality in the training, education and range of services required to support people in getting back to work.  Supporting those in low paid work and precarious employment is also key.  We must ensure decent levels of income support are available for people when they are unemployed.  These are the three interlocking areas we see as very important.<\/p><p>  Deputy Timmy Dooley asked how we might go about strengthening the social dialogue or hearing from unemployed persons.  I will outline briefly some of the work we have done on this issue.  We have arranged a series of meetings with some of our members who are short-term and long-term unemployed, some whom go to local branch social welfare offices and others to local social welfare offices and the new Intreo service offices.  We have gone directly to the social welfare and Intreo offices to hear from people about their experiences.  I am glad to state we will meet senior departmental officials to speak about the experiences of unemployed persons.  This model has worked very well and we would like to develop it further and see it replicated in the case of smaller community-based organisations.  Community infrastructure is vital, as is the social infrastructure.<\/p><p>  Deputy Timmy Dooley also asked what happened when people lost contact and connection with the world of work and its social aspect.  Investment in a range of clubs, sports organisations and communities at a range of levels is vital to ensure people have places to go and others to talk to.  Good practices have been developed by local employment services; for example, each week people volunteer to speak about the jobs they have obtained and the training and education courses they have completed.  People are a very useful resource for each other.  They keep coming back to celebrate the successes of those who leave, who are all too few in the current crisis.  They are also a great help to each other in informing each other about courses.  This can be replicated across the board.  With regard to wider social dialogue, the social inclusion forum hears directly from people who experience disadvantage.  This process could be very useful and needs to be effectively resourced.<\/p><p>  We receive a number of requests from various media outlets with regard to people's individual experiences or comments on various aspects of being unemployed.  It never ceases to surprise me that the biggest response is always on issues such as lack of sleep which are mental health issues which arise from long-term unemployment.  It is vital that we tackle them.  Keeping people connected and networked to potential jobs, training, education, community groups, social clubs and sports organisation is key.  Employment services must have a job at the end and involve quality training and education courses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100008#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385045400,"counter":660,"content":"<p>I came here to speak about issues at a European level and I will not deal with issues of national politics.  <\/p><p>  When the idea of reattaching the social dimension to Economic and Monetary Union was launched in October, it was done so in Brussels with great fanfare at a meeting attended by Mr. Barroso, Mr. von Rompuy and Mr. Andor.  I also attended.  According to my notes, Mr. Barroso stated the social dimension was not an add-on but an integral part and that citizens must see the benefits of the European project, the implication being that since the storm broke an increasing number of citizens had ceased to see the benefits of the European project and seemed disposed to vote for parties in 2014 which were outside the traditional club of the European Parliament such as the EPP, the socialists and democrats and ALDE.  Perhaps it is the cynic in me, but I got the impression tht this might not have happened if the National Front had obtained fewer percentage points in the canton elections in France, but we are where we are and must work with it.<\/p><p>  Looking to the future at a European level, my view is that now we have emerged from the bailout programme, we must start rebuilding our reputation and prevent our reputation from falling in other areas.  This is important.  A debate needs to start on the role of the ECB, which is a big mountain to climb because it is an article of faith in Germany.  It is the Boston and Berlin issue put another way; the ECB needs to become more like the Federal Reserve and act as a lender of last resort.  It needs to stop enjoying the privilege it has.  It is said fear of inflation has been built into German DNA since the time it cost 1 million Deutschmark to buy a loaf of bread after which the rise of Hitler happened, but it is not quite that simple.  That happened in 1923 and it took another ten years for Hitler to come to power.  What brought him to power was the crash and the stagnation afterwards.<\/p><p>  A very interesting seminar was held in Brussels in mid-October on the creation of a European system to pay part of, or the whole of, unemployment benefit.  Commissioner Andor engaged a German foundation to run the numbers and it found that if this had been done in the past ten years, Germany, in particular, would have been neither a net contributor nor a net receiver.  In other words, it would be contributing a lot now but would have received a lot earlier.  Somebody stated it would require a fundamental treaty change and when I hear that phrase, I get a headache.  It might be possible to do something along these lines in a reinsurance model.<\/p> <p>The disappointing thing for all the young people who have left Ireland over the past five years is that they have actually deliberately not chosen the role of citizenship.  The countries to which they tend to go are those that require a visa, where there is a lower platform of rights, such as Australia, Canada and the US, in that order.  There are 155,000 vacancies for apprentices in Bavaria at the moment.  That is a region that is Catholic and governed by a centre-right political party, so there should be a natural fit with us, but people would prefer to go to Sydney or Canberra.  That is very disappointing for the advocates of European union because, when the first crisis happened, young Irish people tended to vote with their feet and say \"No, thank you.  I will go elsewhere.\"  By the way, young Spanish people tend to go to Argentina and young Portuguese tend to take their chances with the oil boom in Angola.  That is an example of people voting with their feet.<\/p><p> This is about the future.  It is about where we go from here.  How will this committee react in a year when we get a list of country-specific recommendations?  For example, Sweden has been asked that the lower rate of VAT in the catering sector be reviewed to see if it produces anything.  Does that sound familiar to anybody?  The CSRs for Poland include a suggestion that, as it has a lot of young people on a succession of short-term contracts, this seems to be a treadmill rather than a ladder.  How do we deal with that?  We cannot make progress on all fronts at the same time, so the bet we will be putting down will be the debate on the privileged role of the European Central Bank and the European institutions and the debate about the privileged role of fighting inflation when the spectre that haunts us is one of deflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100008#G01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Peter Rigney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385046000,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I will now bring in my other two colleagues, but when wrapping up I would like you to make some comment about the indicators that the Commission has suggested.

Is he positive in any way about the potential of the youth guarantee across the region?<\/p><p>  Dr. Healy spoke about the financial transaction tax, and I agree with Deputy Durkan on this.  Unfortunately, we share a common space with the UK and London, and are greatly affected by any decisions there.  If the British Government chose not to impose the financial transaction tax and we did so, it would be very difficult for our financial services sector.  Perhaps he can comment on that.  The OECD suggests that we have a very progressive tax regime.  I imagine Dr. Healy does not agree with that, but it has come from a number of reports from the OECD and others.  People often talk about wealth taxes and Dr. Healy mentioned this in his presentation as well.  Does he accept the point about the mobility of the wealthy, who might leave the country?  I know that President Hollande has not had a lot of success with the imposition of a tax on the wealthy.  There is some concern about that, so perhaps Dr. Healy can comment on that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100009#H00300","speaker":"1110"},{"type":"speech","time":1385046000,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I thank all of the presenters for being here today.  It is a very interesting and important subject and one that breaks some of the historical barriers with regard to what Europe is about and where Europe stands.  We all know that there are different welfare systems within the European Union.  On a basic level, we have the Scandinavian model to which Dr. Rigney referred.  There is the more Anglo-based model, of which Ireland is a part, and then there is the social European model, which is a more family-based model of welfare.  It is very important to recognise that there are significant differences in the way different European countries do business when dealing with issues such as welfare and unemployment.  That is part of the reason this debate is so important.<\/p><p>  I do not agree with Dr. Rigney's assertion that these indicators may be a useful tool but have no teeth.  From my own personal experience at a European level, I have found that the difference is one of language.  For example, a French person might say &quot;<i>J'insiste<\/i>&quot; and what he or she means is &quot;I am asking you&quot;.  There is a difference of language here.  The fact that as European nations we are sitting around and talking about these indicators in itself has a moral persuasion which in European terms means an awful lot more than the same language when used on the floor of the House or Senate of the United States.  That needs to be acknowledged.<\/p><p>  I must agree with my colleagues on some of the points made, and I welcome the comment of Deputy Kyne on the OECD report, which has identified Ireland as a country that has, in spite of the daily rhetoric, hit better off people a lot more than it has hit poorer people.  That needs to be acknowledged.  In response to Dr. Rigney's comments on why Irish people do not choose Bavaria but go to Sydney, Alberta and so on, that is a lack of recognition of the history of Irish people and their patterns of emigration, which have absolutely nothing to do with the current crisis, and the pattern is also due to the fact that we never really got on top of learning languages.  Like our nearest neighbours, that has prevented us from accessing some of the European opportunities.<\/p><p>  I completely disagree with Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy on the point that somewhere along the line, following what he called the 2008 crisis, we suddenly had reductions in social expenditure and social services.  I am not talking simply in an Irish context, but in a Europe-wide context.  It is important to take our heads out of Ireland alone and look more generally at what was actually happening on a global basis in 2007 and 2008.  Globalisation was a significant factor in explaining why we arrived where we are today.  I am sure the witnesses are all aware of the concept of asset-based welfare.  The reality is that all countries, including Scandinavian countries, were looking at aging populations and increased costs of welfare provision and were moving towards asset-based welfare, which is the concept of enabling people, through the acquisition of assets, to look after themselves into their old age.  I could cite a pension report in this country going back a few years - I cannot remember the exact date, although I am sure Dr. Rigney would know better than me - in which serious concerns were raised about that exact issue in Ireland: how are we going to fund the ageing population?<\/p> <p>A similar debate took place all over the developed world.  If we want to talk about the global crisis and why we ended up where we did, it is wrong to say that the cause of the 2008 crisis was entirely a profligate drift in public finances.  It was the same drift in public finances, if the delegation does not mind my saying so, that happened on a global basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100009#H00400","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385046600,"counter":666,"content":"<p>It was not my analysis.

Yes, it went wrong and crashed down around our heads.  I have noticed that the Chairman is pointing at me because I have gotten a bit carried away.  I shall focus my comments a bit more.  It is important to recognise the global aspects of what we are talking about here and the need for a global response.

I imagine that there are previous commissioners from both sides of the Strasbourg aisle who would have done a better job trying to bring the people of Europe with them in that difficult situation.<\/p><p>  With regard to the existing indicators, I would prefer if they had the status of other indicators, but then they probably would not have got them through the Council.  The chosen indicators seem to be a broad net.  There cannot be too many or too few.  Let us see what they produce and what the country-specific recommendations are.  <\/p><p>  I wish to make two points about the demographics of aging.  First, we had a thing called the National Pensions Reserve Fund once upon a time which specifically dealt with the issue but it has, to quote the Bible, gone the way of all flesh, or the majority of it.

The open method of co-ordination is very useful in trying to achieve best practice.  Clearly, if social policy is going to be integral to the European project, then something stronger is required.  That is something that might usefully be considered.<\/p><p>  Without question, the youth guarantee is very welcome at a European level and, within that, at an Irish level.  In an Irish context, one would like to see, as I am sure everybody would, the youth guarantee effectively resourced, particularly as people under 26 have been adversely affected for a number of years.  What strikes me, in the context of social cohesion and social solidarity, is that an unemployed 24-year-old who does not live at home or have dependent children might receive &euro;100 while a person who is 25, who is not part of the youth guarantee as it currently stands, will receive &euro;144.  Those people may well feel that social solidarity has been undermined.  <\/p><p>  I agree with Senator Hayden's remarks on the significant differences in social welfare regimes.  One of the things we would like to see is ambitious European targets that are not about bringing standards or levels of social protection down.  That should be key, not just in Ireland but right across Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100010#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385046600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I wish to return to the Vice Chairman's initial question on indicators.  The suggested range of indicators is far too narrow, as I said earlier.  However, I shall deal with the questions first and return to the matter later.<\/p><p>  First, I will deal with Deputy Kyne's queries.  I feel that we should be prepared to go with the financial transaction tax if, as it appears, ten or 12 countries of substance are prepared to go with the tax.  My response to another of his questions is \"Yes, we do have a problem.\"  We are part of the same area as the UK so there will be a certain consequence if we take on a financial transaction tax.  I have a question, not just for the Deputy, but for the whole decision-making system and countries beyond Ireland.  How do we propose to control the gambling instincts of the financial sector across Europe and the world?  The financial transaction tax has at least some kind of mitigation or holding capacity.  We need a mechanism.  If the committee can come up with something better then I would be all in favour.  The proposal seems to be one of the better things on the table at the moment.  <\/p><p>  The OECD does not believe - it is very important to pick up the nuance - and has never said that we have a progressive tax system.  It has often said, and I agree with it, that we have a progressive income tax system.  The fact is that the overall tax take and its base are not progressive.  That is my basic point.  The second issue, which is probably more important, relates to the overall tax take, not just income tax.  I have not argued for a huge increase in income tax.  I am saying that we have one of the lowest total tax takes no matter how it is measured.  One can measure it as a percentage of GDP or GNP or use the new measure devised by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  It might solve the problem that Ireland always has in deciding whether to use GNP or GDP.  Even using the new number, Ireland's level is more than &euro;5 billion below what it would be if we were at the European average.<\/p><p>  I am being fair when I say that there is room for work in the area.  To have a decent social infrastructure we must support it, and not entirely through tax.  It can be done with lots of combinations of private, public, community and voluntary engagements that are and will be required in the future.  Therefore, we should take somewhere close to the European average in overall tax, as measured by the new figure.  I would be prepared to go along with that decision.<\/p><p>  I wish to say two things to Senator Hayden about her comments on the better-off having taken a greater proportion of the hit.  The studies that revealed those findings omitted two things, which they acknowledged.  First, there is the cumulative impact of changes outside the tax and welfare system, such as cuts in services.  There has been an acknowledgement of same in the various studies by consultants such as Mr. Tim Callan, and the ESRI has shown this also.  I have produced the rest of the study and the quotes that show that this is part of its acknowledgement that it did not measure the whole thing.  <\/p><p>  The second thing is more important in the longer term.<\/p> <p>Some people have huge capacity to take hits, while others have very little.  If someone is a millionaire and takes a 10% hit, that still leaves him or her with &euro;900,000 and he or she will probably still able to survive.  However, if someone is on &euro;188 per week, he or she is already the best part of &euro;20 below the poverty line and if he or she takes a 5% hit, it could push him or her over the edge.  One is not comparing like with like in that context.  <\/p><p> I am a little bemused by the lecture about the need to stop being parochial and realise there is globalisation and so on.  As someone who has written books on the issue, I agree that we need to do it.  To tell me that I have not done so is a bit much and I do not accept it.  Last year I forwarded to the committee a copy of a book entitled, <i>Does the European Social Model Have a Future<\/i>, which looked at the five models, not three, across the European Union and which included a variety of contributions from academics across Europe, as well as our own views.  In April we published the book <i>What Would Real Recovery Look Like<\/i>, a copy of which was also forwarded to the committee.  In that publication we go back not just to the 1970s and 1080s but to the 1940s and 1950s.  On some 80 pages we spell out exactly what happened across the world, using all of the best research available on financial issues, globalisation and a whole lot of other stuff----- <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100010#J00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385047200,"counter":675,"content":"<p>On the international academic argument about whether there are three, five or seven models of the welfare state, there are three principal models.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100011#K00400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385047200,"counter":676,"content":"<p>No, there is a very simple-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100011#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1385047200,"counter":677,"content":"<p>There are three principal models.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100011#K00600","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1385047200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>We have a small issue with the clock.

A few years ago Amartya Sen and Joe Stiglitz, two Nobel laureates, were brought together by the noted radical President Sarkozy of France to produce a study - it is a masterpiece - of what needed to be measured.  They identified four items not listed here, including an environmental measurement, the issue of sustainability in the environment which is critical, as is the issue of financial sustainability.  Why is that so?  The answer is because the first thing that is dropped when the situation gets really bad is the social dimension.  The banks are protected, while services for people are cut.  We need financial sustainability indicators.  The social indicators, specifically well-being, are critically important.  Much work has been done in this area, some of it by us.  It has been published and we can make it available to the committee.  Therefore, we need environmental sustainability, financial sustainability and well-being indicators.  That was my basic argument.  If we are to see Economic and Monetary Union progress and genuinely include, not just rhetorically, the social dimension, the indicators have to be across the five areas of macroeconomic stability, just taxation, social protection, governance and sustainability, and locked together.  There must be no possibility of one being dropped in favour of another.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2013112100011#K00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy"},{"type":"speech","time":1385047200,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates.

It is great to be here.  The coffee we had upstairs was wonderful.  Like many others, we had a very high-octane political education from the taxi driver from Connolly Station, in language that was neither parliamentary nor church.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for the invitation and I do not say that in a clich&eacute;d way.  We really are delighted to be here because we belong to an all-Ireland church.  There is sometimes a perception that the Presbyterian Church is largely a northern church.  That may be true in a strictly numerical sense but we do have congregations in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Dublin.  We are an all-Ireland church and the all-Ireland dimension matters a lot to us.  It is in our DNA, so to speak.  This is not simply a case of some northerners coming to Dublin.  We are an all-Ireland church and therefore the engagement with folks here is very important to us.  <\/p><p>  We will try to be relatively brief on the topic before us today and then we can have a discussion, in parliamentary language.  The challenges in urban Belfast are numerous.  The issues facing the city are, at times, acute but they are not confined to the city.  One of the issues we are particularly keen to tease out is that some of the issues that present themselves most acutely in the city are actually part of a set of wider needs within Northern Ireland.  <\/p><p>  As a church delegation we come to the challenges of the city with a pastoral and compassionate heart.  Although it is blindingly obvious, it is worth saying that we are not political analysts or social commentators.  We are not even politicians.  We leave that work to the people here.  While we are happy to offer comment on political matters, even tricky ones, we are not in the business of telling political leaders what to do.  Politicians are mandated, within their parties and by their constituents, to take decisions.  We are not going to tell them what to do.  We might say that we would love them to do this, that and the other, lobby them and lean on them but it is important to us, both theologically and practically, to acknowledge the vocation which political leaders have.  <\/p><p>  It is also worth saying that the Presbyterian Church is the largest Protestant church in the North and as part of that wider faith community, plays a major part in the life of both urban and rural communities.  There is a mountain of research which shows that, for example, at least 75% of the total youth work in our communities, including the statutory youth work, is done directly by the churches, through youth clubs, organisations like the Guide movement or the Boys' Brigade and so forth.  We make a similar contribution to work with mothers and toddlers and the elderly.  Crucially, the work we seek to do within our communities is not dependent on people coming to church or being connected with our local church.  We do it for the welfare of the whole community, whoever they are and wherever they come from.  The basic point I am making is that church life plays as important a role in the life of the urban communities of Belfast as it does in other parishes throughout Ireland, irrespective of whether people have religious views or Christian commitment.  We are quite close to the ground and it is from that perspective that we are making our comments today.<\/p><p>  This committee has had discussions with many groups and individuals over the last few years.  Indeed, we have even read some of the transcripts of previous meetings and are grateful to those who make those transcripts available.  With that in mind, we are not going to repeat what members already know.  Perhaps I can set out some parts of the scene in parts of loyalist \/Unionist Belfast.  I have lived with my family on the interface of the Ardoyne for over 25 years.  Therefore, what I am saying and sharing with this committee is not a mere textbook or academic perspective but a lived one.  It may surprise members to hear me say that the experience of living on the interface has been and continues to be an immensely satisfying and worthwhile one. <\/p><p>  There are many good news stories from in and around Belfast.  <\/p> <p>While we must talk about difficult things, we recognise that many good things happen in urban Belfast.  Just in case members are ever tempted to become a tourist and come to Belfast, I can do no better than to quote from the &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; guide<br \/>states:<blockquote>Once lumped with Beirut, Baghdad and Bosnia as one of the four 'B' s for travellers to avoid, Belfast has pulled off a remarkable transformation from bombs-and bullets pariah to hip-hotels and hedonism party town.<\/blockquote>The sort of place that Members of the Oireachtas would want to come to.<blockquote>The city's skyline is in a constant state f flux as redevelopment continues apace.  The old shipyards are giving way to the luxury waterfront apartments of the Titanic Quarter, and Victoria Sq, Europe's biggest regeneration project, has added a massive city-centre shopping mall to a list of tourist attractions that includes Victorian architecture, a glittering waterfront lined with modern art, foot-stomping music ... [which my colleagues know well] in packed out pubs and the UK's second-biggest arts festival.<\/blockquote> In discussing the challenges of urban Belfast we would not like members to think that we live in some sort of war weary downtrodden area.  That is not the case, however one cannot miss the constant media coverage of protests, flags and an increasingly disillusioned urban population in the traditional Unionist heartlands of east Belfast, the Shankill Road and other parts of the city.  Three hundred yards from my front door there have been and continue to be daily parades and protests since mid July, which must be policed at a cost of approximately &euro;50,000 per day.  The bill to date this year totals more than &euro;6 million.  A further &euro;50,000 will be spent today and another &euro;50,000 will be spent tomorrow and so on.  It is all too easy to wish that this would simply go away and normal life would resume as soon as possible.  That is to fundamentally misunderstand the underlying issues that are symbolised in these events at the interface areas.  Members will hear more of that later on this morning.  Central to this disaffection is a deeply perceived loss of identify in these communities as a result of the political developments of the past 15 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p> If an individual perceives that he or she does not matter, and I am sure this has happened to us or in our families, depression or worse is likely to set in.  Likewise if a community feels it is regarded as worthless or feels ignored or that others have been or are still being treated better than they are, then inevitably there is a cost to the whole of society for that perceived disaffection and disillusionment.  This is important.  Everybody pays for the disaffection of the few.  This is arguably the biggest single challenge facing the areas in which we work across urban Belfast.  We might talk about what can be done and who might help.  While disaffection is being played out on the streets of urban Belfast, that disaffection with the outcomes of the Good Friday Agreement is shared across the province much more widely than we might like to think.  That connects with the point I made earlier that we are as a church in every parish in the land and whilst we are talking about the challenge of the city we have our radar right across the province.  Inevitably the general picture of community relations in the city has worsened in recent months.  Much good work is being done across the communities on the ground but the environment in which community relations work is taking place seems to us to be steadily deteriorating.  A good example of this wider context was given by Willie Hay, the speaker of the legislative assembly in Stormont on Tuesday.<blockquote>I just cannot allow Members to make a contribution and to be so offensive that, coming from senior politicians, it is unbelievable.<\/blockquote>The point I make is that the quality of public discourse seriously impacts on what happens on the streets.  If there is aggravation at the most senior levels of political debate, one cannot expect local communities to be hugging each other.  That is a point that members might want to pursue and we would be happy to do so.  There is a very important role for members of this committee to help raise the standard of public discourse in the North.<\/p><p> I am sure members are well aware of the annual peace monitoring report published each year by the community relations council.  The 2012 report showed that the highest achieving group educationally in the North were rural Catholic girls, whereas the lowest achieving group was urban Protestant boys.  This is on page 107 of the 2012 Peace Monitoring Report.  There is a significant educational challenge to help this group of disillusioned, disempowered Protestant boys but that cannot be done in isolation from the wider educational framework, which is complex.  My colleague, Rev. Trevor Gribben is the expert on educational matters and he will take the issue further.  It is easy to make the assumption there is an educational fix that can be pulled out of somewhere for these things.  I do not think we would share that view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Very Rev. Dr. Norman Hamilton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385032200,"counter":694,"content":"<p>I am a minister of the church.  I have served in the inner city in Belfast.  My first parish was in Strabane in the far west and then I served in north Belfast and Newtownabbey.  I now work and lead up, together with others, the central secretariat.  I have key responsibility for education, both north and south of the Border.  I interact with governments in both jurisdictions.<\/p><p>  I will give a perspective on the unique educational challenge for what has been coined in many reports as \"Protestant working class boys\".  To use that shorthand could appear out of context to be offensive, to describe a person as Protestant, could be seen as sectarian, working class as an old fashioned term and boys as a gender issue but every report that has been done objectively by academics and other educationalist over the past number of years , as Very Rev. Dr. Norman Hamilton has hinted, that for whatever reason the most challenging educational environment in the North is in the inner city among Protestant working class boys.  What is the reason for that?  Much research has been conducted and many of the conclusions when drawn together bring two key factors into play, first the decline, as happened in many cities of traditional industry such as shipyards, the rope works and so on.  They were located in the city and for a whole variety of reasons, which I hope are now in our past and from which we have on, tended to provide employment for one section of the community.  They tended to be Protestant working class from east Belfast and such areas.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, as across the western world, those traditional industries began to decline.  One might say quite rightly that has happened all over the place, but other places in the United Kingdom, Ireland and throughout Europe have moved on and people have coped with that decline of traditional manufacturing industry.  Why are the Protestant working class boys the most educationally disadvantaged in inner city Belfast?  The reason is that as those industries were in their steepest decline during what we euphemistically call the Troubles began in the late 1960s.  Communities that needed 15 to 25 years to turn around from a focus on traditional industry did not have the same opportunities as other parts of the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p>There should have been investment in those communities, along with other working-class deprived areas in Belfast.  Much of the money in question was used to deal with the Troubles and the impact of the Troubles.  Those communities never got a chance to reinvent themselves.  There was a low level of respect for education.  Many people knew they would get a job in the shipyard at the age of 14 because their fathers and grandfathers had worked there.  The educational aspirations in such inner-city communities were low.  The nature of the sectarian issues in Belfast meant that such communities tended to be in working-class Protestant areas.<\/p><p> What has happened since then?  We went through a period of ceasefires which led to the Good Friday Agreement 15 years ago.  The communities to which I refer, which were affected by low self-esteem, massive unemployment and a lack of value being placed on education, also suffered from the blight of loyalist paramilitaries allegedly defending them against republicans but in practice oppressing them in many ways.  This meant that those communities could not develop.  As a result, 30 or 40 years after the decline of traditional industry, there was still massive unemployment, a lack of self-esteem and low levels of desire for education.  When the Good Friday Agreement came along, it offered hope and a new beginning.  Where are we, some 15 years later?  As Dr. Hamilton said, there is a sense in those communities that the hope I have mentioned has not been delivered on.  There is a sense in working-class Protestant communities in inner-city Belfast that the Good Friday Agreement did lots for \"them\" - middle-class Protestant communities further up the road and Nationalist Catholic communities - but little for \"us\".  The Good Friday Agreement is seen by those people as not having delivered.<\/p><p> I would like to refer the committee to two recent reports.  In 2004, a task force of the Northern Ireland Department for Social Development published a survey, Renewing Communities, which drew attention to the fact that Protestant working-class areas of inner-city Belfast had been diagnosed as having low educational attainment, low aspiration and apparent acceptance of economic inactivity.  That was especially true among young Protestant males.  In March 2011, Dawn Purvis, who was an MLA for East Belfast at the time, brought together a group that produced an excellent report on educational disadvantage in Protestant working-class communities.  The report, which was published in March 2011, contained many recommendations and was well received.  It emphasised the need to invest in early years education in order to increase the level of educational aspiration.  It recommended that schools be given a greater degree of flexibility to allow them to move away from an enforced common curriculum at secondary level, if necessary, and develop vocational courses.  It called for the issue of academic selection to be dealt with in some kind of working compromise.  To put it bluntly, there has been a lack of delivery of some of those practical things.<\/p><p> The level of educational aspiration among the Protestant community in some areas of inner-city Belfast means that education is not valued.  This is reflected in some parts of the Catholic community as well.  There is a need for a massive investment in early years education so that this can be turned around.  I will give an example.  The 2011 report recommended that a co-ordinating group be established.  Most Protestants in Northern Ireland tend to go to controlled schools.  That sector has never had a sectoral group to share good practice, to build ethos and to build identity.  The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools has worked to build ethos and share identity in that sector, but there has not been an equivalent group in the controlled sector.  Two or three years after the establishment of such a group was recommended, it is still not in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Rev.

One of the factors that leads to what can almost be described as depression in certain loyalist-Protestant working class communities in Belfast is that they do not see a difference.  They do not see the so-called peace dividend affecting them.  The reality is that it has affected all of the community and working class communities have benefited but on the ground they do not see this.  Because I work in education I am illustrating from that point of view.  For instance, some of the big ideological disputes ongoing in education over academic selection, a common funding formula and a definition of shared education are at a level where accommodations and agreements are not being made between politicians that can be delivered on the ground.  Politicians have every right to have their party political viewpoints, but the art of politics involves accommodation, compromise and bringing solutions that work on the ground.  There are too many pieces of legislation blocked in ongoing debates in the Executive by whoever it might be.  Where co-ordinated intervention between Departments is needed on behalf of ordinary communities in the inner city, it is not happening.  While politicians will debate and discuss accommodations, compromises are not arrived at quickly enough to actually make an impact.  There is a generation of young people, 15 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, who had hope held out to them, but it is not being delivered on in reality.  I could tell the committee in great detail about some of the things that need to happen in education, but I will not go any further.<\/p><p>  I wish to touch very briefly on the issue of shared education.  The concept of shared education is being developed in the North and all of the churches are very supportive.  I am sure committee members have followed the debate.  It is different from integrated education which takes place in one school in which people from two communities are educated together in a proportion of 60:40 proportion either way.  The concept of shared education recognises the reality that most people in the North are educated either in schools that are predominantly populated by Protestant or Catholic children.  It helps those schools begin to journey together.  I illustrate two small rural primary schools in a small village which has been scarred by the Troubles where every Friday all classes are taught as if they are in one school and children mix naturally in the classroom.  One might say, \"So what?  That is not a big step forward.\"  For that community, it is massive.  That new concept has a big part to play in Belfast.  Why?  The answer is because people still tend to live in single identity communities.  By definition, the local primary school is predominantly Protestant because all of the houses around it are lived in by people who are predominantly Protestant or Catholic.  How can we move forward in developing the concept of shared education?  Again, I have to say it has not been rolled out quickly enough.  Shared education projects in Northern Ireland are funded by the American Ireland Fund and American philanthropies.  They are not mainstream and not funded from the budged for the Northern Ireland Executive.  Developing the idea of sitting together in a classroom with people from the other side and seeing their humanity will be a big factor in stopping the behaviour that results in throwing stones at the other side.  These initiatives need to be rolled out.  Education is the key, although it is not the magic solution to everything.  Schools are not to blame for where we are in Northern Ireland, but schools and good policy can be part of delivering for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100006#H00200","nonspeaker":"Rev.

Dr. Hamilton and Rev. Gribben, I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  We appreciate the opportunity to be here.  <\/p><p>  Last year I was Moderator of the church.  I have ministered in north Belfast and Newry and now minister in north Down, but unlike my colleagues, I am a Southerner as I am originally from Monaghan.  My family roots are still there; my mother, brothers and so on still live in Monaghan.  I have a real concern, from the Southern perspective, that people here continue to engage with the issues of the North.  It is very important that they do so.  I am a little concerned that there is a sense that apart from a few issues, everything is okay, as people are not killing each other.  I am concerned that, at whatever level, the eye will be taken off the ball and in regard to reconciliation and developing real peace in our communities, that people will fail to see that this still needs to be a priority in so far as the Government in the South is concerned.  I am concerned about this but appreciate that what the committee is doing is a source of real encouragement to the process in terms of the need to continue to engage.<\/p><p>  From my personal background, in so far as implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is concerned and how it impacts on legislation and in so far as minorities in the Republic are concerned, there should be a real concern to cherish all the children of the nation, if I can put it that way.  Sometimes in the past - perhaps, it is still the case today - Presbyterians and Protestants felt it was best to keep quiet and not to cause particular problems.  One needs to be very aware to make sure that is not happening and that people really feel they are part of the State.  In counties Donegal and Monaghan and other places there has been concern about how educational funding will be rolled out.<\/p> <p>We fully appreciate the need for rationalisation in the delivery of school and similar processes.  I do not think there is any intentional discrimination, but sometimes in the outworking, it seems that at the point of delivery people do not believe they are receiving the support they need.  I want all of us to reflect on how minorities can always be appreciated and valued equally within the State.  This has an impact on how reconciliation takes place in Northern Ireland.  As we know, things can roll over and, perhaps, be misused or misunderstood. <\/p><p> I appreciate the opportunity to be here and I am happy to continue the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100006#H00400","nonspeaker":"Rev.

Somebody said, \"If you don't know your history, you don't know anything.\"  Last Sunday week I attended a remembrance service in Boyle, a ceremony that has been celebrated for the past ten years.  I come from a town of 3,000 people; some126 young men from it died in the First World War.  These young men were never remembered until this remembrance service began.  Some 400 people from County Roscommon and 50,000 from the island of Ireland died in the First World War.  Some 700 Nationalists from west Belfast joined the Connacht Rangers in Boyle for obvious reasons.  Those who died were forgotten, but they are part of a shared history we should remember.  My family comes from Cullyhanna, a Nationalist area in south Armagh, but those who participated in the First World War are part of our history.<\/p><p>  I wish to raise two issues.  First, there is a huge clamour to have a truth commission in Northern Ireland.  What are the delegates' views on the proposal that there be a truth commission?  Do they see it as positive, or are there issues with which they have a difficulty in that regard?  Second, when we were in Northern Ireland last year, we visited the Skainos centre on the Newtownards Road where we witnessed an address by Mr. Martin McGuinness and Mr. Peter Robinson.  Nothing could have been more perfect on the day, but less than one week later the flags protest broke out.  I understand, as the delegates have pointed out, that there is an underlying issue.  However, could the flags protest have been managed in a better way?  What caused it to manifest on the streets of Northern Ireland?  Is there an urban-rural divide with the Orange Order? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100007#J00500","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1385033700,"counter":707,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Jack Wal, who will be followed by Ms Michelle Gildernew, MLA<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100007#J00600","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speech","time":1385033700,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I welcome the reverend gentlemen.  In my town of Athy, County Kildare we have a Presbyterian church and there is a good active community there.<\/p><p>  Many matters need to be addressed in Belfast and throughout Northern Ireland, but I see the main issue as education.  I was delighted to hear the three reverend gentlemen talk about education here.  I would see it as a lost opportunity in the North for generations if all of the other issues in the North had to be fixed before education became a priority.  It is a priority for all the young people of Belfast.  I have visited the city on numerous occasions and been disappointed to learn of the state of education services within the city.  Perhaps the reverend gentlemen might be able to give us an overview of the attitude of families to education.  In the South the strength of the education system comes from the family seeking the best for their sons and daughters.  This follows through in the mechanisms of parents councils, parents associations and everything else.  What is the position in Belfast in that regard?  Irrespective of the obstacles and problems in society, one would imagine that the strength of families in seeking the best for their children would overcome these issues.<\/p><p>  Another factor that comes across strongly in visits to Belfast is the lack of public representation in areas in which there are poor education services.  These areas seem to lack public representation; there are no representatives in the Northern Irish Assembly residing in areas in which these educational problems are to be found.  Is this an issue?  How strong is family support in these areas to ensure young people will have an equal opportunity to do the best for themselves?  That is the key issue.  If we can ensure education is the priority, many of the problems will be overcome.  Education will improve many aspects of life in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100007#J00700","speaker":"950"},{"type":"speech","time":1385033700,"counter":709,"content":"<p>I call Ms Michelle Gildernew who will be followed by Deputy Brendan Smith.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100007#J00800","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385033700,"counter":710,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilte romhaibh go l&eacute;ir.  I am delighted to welcome the reverend gentlemen.  It is nice to see them again and follow on the discussions we have had in the past 12 months.  I listened attentively to their contributions and believe there must be recognition that disadvantage does not just affect young Protestants.  There are social and economic problems across Belfast which affect people of all persuasions.  Part of the problem for working class unionist or Protestant communities is that for years their political leaders have been telling them that their life is shite and that they are worse off than others.  If one looks at the deprivation statistics, the most deprived areas in the North are Nationalist, but there are other ways to monitor disadvantage.<\/p><p>  I am very concerned also.  I know that there are young people who are growing up not just in dysfunctional families but also in communities that need help and support.  I was glad when the Reverend Trevor Gribben mentioned children's early years which are critical.  We tried to get Unionist leaders in the Northern Ireland Assembly to understand it was far too late to wait until a child was five years old for early intervention to start, but we could not persuade them.  It was very frustrating to hear Unionist leaders say intervening at the age of five years was time enough.  It is not.  Early intervention starts before a baby is born, in supporting the family unit, whatever form it takes, and giving people the skills to be good parents and to help prepare their children for an educational environment.  If a child can never learn to play, it cannot learn how to learn.  We have schemes such as Sure Start and Home-Start, but I could not persuade the Health Minister to understand the validity and importance of schemes such as these.  The problem of social disadvantage will never be fixed unless we start at a very early age.  <\/p><p>  The 11+ transfer test is another issue.  Unionists wish to see this test remain and the figures were cited.  How do we square the circle?  As the examination did not work for hundreds and thousands of young people, why is there a fixation with maintaining the system?  For young people who have struggled through seven years in primary school, to be branded a failure before they move on to post-primary level does not help the perception of their place in society.  Reverend Gribben said he had significant details.  If there is a written submission on the issue, I would like to see it.<\/p><p>  Disadvantage runs across communities.  In this regard, we would like to hear the ideas of the Presbyterian Church.  The Very Reverend Dr. Hamilton said they were not here to tell us what to do, but we would like to hear their ideas on how the Executive should act to tackle disadvantage, including their proposals to target on the basis of objective need.<\/p> <p>I agree 100% that if a person gets off to a bad start, not only does it affect possible educational attainment, it also has an ongoing impact on mental health.  It is very difficult for a person to take his or her place in society if his or her educational attainment is so low that he or she cannot find a job, of which the mental health impact can be very damaging.<\/p><p> I would like to make a suggestion that we invite representatives of the Fermanagh Trust because the work it has done is far above that done in any other area, of which I can give an example.  There were protests outside a school a decade ago because it had a Catholic dinner lady, but the school is now involved in shared education with its neighbouring schools.  It has been an absolutely huge success.  The Fermanagh Trust is leading the way, but it has received good support from the bishops and others.  The trust tells a brilliant story.  We must understand that unless we get the right policies in place to help the children coming through, they will not be able to go to school and learn.  I would love to see the figures the delegates have for the level of achievement at school, particularly Protestant boys in rural areas.  The relationship any of us has with education is key to how we attain it.  That seems to be lacking; when people are told for years that they are never going to come to anything, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100007#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385034300,"counter":712,"content":"<p>As five more committee members are offering, I make another appeal for brevity.

The same message was given to us in east Belfast 12 months ago.  Listening to Reverend Hamilton in particular, the situation seems to have deteriorated rather than improved in the meantime.  He has mentioned that 75% of youth work is organised by the churches.  Is there a difference in participation levels, depending on the areas involved?  Is there a particular difference between more affluent and less advantaged areas?  I presume the state provides some support for these programmes of youth activities that the churches organise.  I compliment the churches on doing what is very necessary and important work.<\/p><p>  I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Jack Wall on the difference education can make.  He made these points forcefully when we were in east Belfast.  Up until the late 1990s, the State had very poor provision for early and preschool education.  From the late 1990s onwards, there has been massive investment in the preschool sector which is now run both by community-based organisations and private providers and it is working extremely well and very effective.  When one speaks to teachers at primary and second level, they will always refer to advantage in terms of a child having an opportunity to participate in early childhood education.  Reverend Gribben mentioned the report by Dawn Purvis in 2011 and a specific set of recommendations on what needed to be done.  We can have all the policies in the world and the best of intentions and reports, but we need intervention.  Have the Assembly, the Ministers with responsibility for education - there are two - and the Executive undertaken any pilot project providing for a new method of education and training?  Has anything happened to try to tackle the particular problems in these areas?  In the past we had the RAPID programme that was targeted at some particularly disadvantaged areas to try to bring together the local authorities and health and education services.  My knowledge of it is that it depended on who provided the leadership, but in areas in which there is an all-government or all-agency approach to the issues facing young people, there has been a good outcome, depending on the leadership given by the statutory agencies or the lead agency involved.  Has any such project been undertaken in Belfast or other disadvantaged areas?<\/p><p>  I compliment the delegates once again on their presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100008#K00300","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1385034300,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I welcome all of the delegates.  Like Reverend Patton, I am from County Monaghan and fascinated by what he has said about the experiences of rural communities.  On the deprivation experienced by people in east Belfast, the lack of a connection between young people and their political leaders and the lack of economic opportunities which is probably based on a lack of educational attainment, what can be done to address this problem?<\/p><p>  On what Reverend Gribben said about shared education, I would like to share our experiences in the past 20 years south of the Border.  Many years ago we had a Reverend Turtle in Ballybay, County Monaghan who thought it was very important for minorities in communities to have their own schools and a strong sense of community in order to give them a strong sense of identity.  In the past 25 years, through sport and education through the VECs, the communities concerned have come together.   We have a very strong Presbyterian community in Ballybay and the mid-Monaghan area and church numbers are growing.  That is a positive sign that it does not matter in which jurisdiction people are; their church can be strong regardless.  As Reverend Hamilton pointed out, it is a very strong all-Ireland church.  Just like in Belfast, the members of the Presbyterian community in County Monaghan are strongly involved in community activities which are valued by all members of the community.<\/p><p>  What can be done about the lack of connectivity between the political classes in Belfast and the young urban Protestant community?  In terms of the peace dividend, what can be done to develop economic opportunities for everyone across Northern Ireland and in the Border counties?  It is not just about a disconnection in Belfast; it also happens in peripheral rural areas north and south of the Border.   What can be done to make sure people feel connected to the peace process in order that they can believe it is of benefit to them and their families and that they can be worthwhile members of society?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100008#K00400","speaker":"972"},{"type":"speech","time":1385034300,"counter":715,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael P.

We raised these issues during our visit to Belfast.  <\/p><p>  The church has been very strong in the pastin Ireland but huge changes have taken place.  There are now more stakeholders involved in education such as community schools, vocational education schools and so on.  What concerns many here are the rationalisations, as Reverend Patton mentioned, but I often think that if something is not broken, there is no reason to try to fix it.  In that respect, minority education services are very important in order that all children can be cherished equally.  This will be very important when it comes to making major changes in schools, particularly smaller schools.<\/p><p>  Reverend Hamilton referred to Catholic girls in rural areas and Protestant boys in urban areas.  If we take out the words \"rural\" and \"urban\", in the past girls have done very well in education when compared with boys, but perhaps this has not been shown in the levels of attainment, promotion and advancement.  In this state there are a large number of female teachers in the primary education system.  When it came to the points system for third level education, we devised a system, HPAT, as the procedure to be used where someone wants to study medicine.<\/p> <p>There have been arguments for and against that and whether it discriminates against girls and so on.  Whether one argues for or against changes to the education system, the bottom line is that the disadvantage exists.  My query relates to how the witnesses can deal with that.  How can the witnesses involve more people in the way that, for example, the vocational education system or community schools do, more so than in the past, when the church had a strong involvement in education?<\/p><p> I like the concept of shared education, to which the witnesses referred.  Will the witnesses explain how they see the roll-out of that proceeding from now on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100008#K00600","speaker":"1040","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385034900,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I thank each of the witnesses for the presentations, which were informative, measured and well put.  The witnesses referred to the consequences of social deprivation.  I maintain that we have social deprivation in the South and that it is equally bad and, in many instances, possibly worse.  I believe the problem is sectarianism added to social deprivation.  That becomes an excuse or the reason for anger or expressions of anger and so forth.<\/p><p>  If we are to deal with the problem, several issues must be dealt with.  We need to break down sectarian divisions and so forth.  Education is of major importance in generating a tolerance, an understanding and a methodology for being able to argue and debate a given point.  Employment or a lack of employment is a major problem.  People without jobs or education have major difficulties and they should have the opportunity to get the necessary employment.  All of that is a contributing factor.<\/p><p>  The witnesses referred to the disconnect between working-class Protestant areas and the Good Friday Agreement or the Assembly or whatever.  The disconnect can take many dimensions but the most important dimension is a lack of political leadership.  There is a problem if there is no political leadership or representation.  This committee had an excellent meeting in the Andy Tyrie Interpretive Centre on the Newtownards Road approximately one year ago.  It was an excellent meeting with the leadership of one section of the UDA.  The four brigadiers from Belfast were at the meeting.  It was a progressive meeting but one thing that came across clearly was that, in the Protestant working-class or loyalist areas, there are what are described as former combatants, but they do not represent their communities in an electoral sense.  However, across the divide in the nationalist areas former combatants are now Sinn F&eacute;in activists who are embedded and ingrained in their communities.  They are giving leadership and representation to their communities.  This was described in the committee once by Jackie McDonald.  He noted that he was before this committee looking at MPs, Deputies and MLAs, all elected representatives from the nationalist communities and many of them former combatants.  However, they do not have that on the other side.  It seems to me that that deficit must be addressed, but the only people who can address it are the people within the community prepared to give the necessary leadership.  These people need to have the opportunity to become representatives for the common good.  That needs to be looked at but it can only come from within.<\/p><p>  I have always had the view that the role of the churches in generating and sustaining sectarianism has been questionable.  That is my personal view.  I note in latter years the fantastic efforts being made to break that down, and that is to be welcomed and encouraged.  However, the role of the church should not be underestimated when it comes to mitigating sectarianism in a community or communities which have become victims of a sectarian system that has prevailed for a long time.  We need to address that.<\/p><p>  I welcome the commitment and the efforts of the witnesses.  I do not have a gloomy picture because there are many positives in what the witnesses have said.  It is easy to be critical and gloomy but we should be challenging instead.  We should challenge where we believe things are not going right.  We are in a far better place - indeed, a very good place - compared to where we have come from.  There are still difficulties to be resolved and those difficulties are resolvable.<\/p><p>  There is a role for people from within working-class communities in representing those communities, but I do not detect it at present in the light of our visit to the Newtownards Road or the several occasions on which people have come from those working-class areas to appear before the committee.  They did not have an electoral mandate but it is essential that they work and get an electoral mandate.  This is because along with having an electoral mandate comes responsibility and with that responsibility comes an opportunity to address the grievances and perceived wrongs, whether real or otherwise, in the Protestant community.  That is the way out of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100009#L00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1385034900,"counter":719,"content":"<p>I am pleased that the witnesses started their contribution by referring to the positive things going on and in particular the statement about how it was immensely satisfying and encouraging to live in an interface area.  It is a positive message that needs to be sent out.  It is part of all that is going on in the background which people throughout the island do not hear about, but it is going on every hour of every day.<\/p><p>  The witnesses referred to disillusion.  Part of the difficulty has to do with perception.  A Queen's University of Belfast professor gave us results from a survey on the perceptions of Nationalists and Unionists, especially young people and their perceptions of the Good Friday Agreement and what had come out of it.  On the Unionist side there was disillusionment.  People took the view that things were going backwards and not improving, while on the Nationalist side people believed there had been improvements.  The reality was rather different in terms of jobs, poverty and so on.  The greater amount of disadvantage was still in the Nationalist rather than the Protestant areas, but the perception was rather different.  Part of the difficulty is that people were talking it down in their own community and talking down the potential of change.<\/p><p>  The witnesses referred to the Good Friday Agreement and the potential for a new beginning and the hope that came out of it.  However, part of the difficulty in the process is that there are parties within the process that are in government at the moment that did not agree with the Good Friday Agreement or with change.  To some extent, they are still fighting the battles from earlier years.  The are still trying to stop change.<\/p><p>  In terms of politics and politicians, how do we find a compromise between people who want things to stay the same and those who have a rosy view of a utopian past and about how great things were and who want things to go back to the way they were?  We know from talking to people that things were not rosy or great in the past.  There is potential in the future for things to change.<\/p><p>  Reference was made to disadvantage and the traditional industries and so on.  I could bring the witnesses around areas of this city where things are a good deal worse than Belfast in terms of disadvantage, poverty, drugs, crime and inequality.  These are problems throughout the island, not only in the North.  The sectarian nature of the state needs to be tackled by all of us.  Collectively, we need to come together and come up with ideas.  It is about these things.<\/p> <p>There is also a need for role models.  It struck me when I went into these Protestant, working class, Loyalist areas that they did not have the role models other areas had.  <\/p><p> People talk about the lack of leadership.  There is leadership, but, unfortunately, it is not a collective political leadership and it seems to come from one community and one political persuasion.

We are not trying to generate work for the committee or ingratiate ourselves, but the complexity and importance of these issues are such that we cannot deal with them in 30 seconds.  If it is acceptable to the committee, we would like to have an ongoing conversation in which we could explore some of these tricky issues in a more orderly way.  We would even feed the members and be nice to them over lunch if that would entice them to engage in an ongoing conversation.  On the basis that we could do this better over a period of time, I will make a few specific comments.  Reverend Gibbon may comment on the issue of education, while Reverend Patton may also have something to say briefly.<\/p><p>  Research shows that across the province, over a long time, at least 75% of youth work has been done in Protestant communities within the church sector.  In recent years there have been other very important contributors to youth work.  Even in my own congregation in north Belfast, 150 young people will come through our doors this week.  It has longevity and scale, but it is by no means exclusive.<\/p><p>  The flags issue is immensely complex, which is why I hesitate to make any real comment on it.  Identity is at the heart of the flags protest.  Does anybody care who we are?  I am not justifying any action; I am just trying to give a perspective to understand the action.  It is fundamentally about a sense of identity being rubbished or set aside.  There is a very important conversation to be had about how both identities are properly reflected across the island.  It is only fair to say a large section of the loyalist and Unionist community believe its identity is being set aside and not being replaced by something that is equally valuable to it.  Perhaps our colleagues will have something to say on this.  <\/p><p>  The question of political leadership came up several times.

I agree that we need to elect people from the urban areas to the political leadership.<\/p><p>  Dealing with the past has come up in a variety of forms, whether the historic role of the churches or the involvement of competence in the political process.  Specifically, we are not at all persuaded of the need for an international commission for truth and reconciliation because truth, or the search for it, can easily become a weapon to be used against others rather than as a mechanism for healing.  Our preference is for an international commission for community healing, which is prospective, rather than a commission for truth, which is primarily retrospective.  I know the argument about not heading into the future without having dealt with the past, but we think an emphasis on truth would prevent community healing, which is the future for our kids.

Michelle Gildernew would point towards the Fermanagh Trust for particular reasons.  I commend the trust and encourage the committee to listen to it.  The other two big providers in the area of shared education are the Queen's University shared education programme under Professor Tony Gallagher and the North-Eastern Education and Library Board PIEE scheme which deals with primary schools.  These three together will give the committee a brilliant picture of the potential of shared education to change education and build reconciliation in Northern Ireland, if the committee takes cognisance of their work.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Ferris referred to areas in Dublin which were equally deprived as those in Belfast.  I accept that fully.  The point I wish to make is that owing to the impact of the Troubles, the opportunities to rebuild and rejuvenate whole communities following the decline of traditional industries were not seized and put back by 30 years.  The work that should have been done in the 1970s and 1980s to rebuild communities could not happen and did not happen because of the Troubles.  Therefore, they are much further behind.<\/p><p> I fully accept that the churches have shown sectarian attitudes and that they have got it wrong.  We share this with most people in society in Northern Ireland.  As Dr. Hamilton said, as we try to move forward we need to be honest about this fact.<\/p><p> Early years education is vital.  The Dawn Purvis report contains super recommendations.  People like Dawn Purvis, Pete Shirlow and Mark Langhammer are the experts and we are happy to listen to them.  It is most important to build and incentivise leadership in education in inner city schools.  It is much better to be a principal in a grammar school in the suburbs than it is to be a principal in a difficult secondary school in the inner city.  We need to incentivise leadership in education in schools.  The CCMS and our Catholic colleagues have been good at doing this, but it tends not to have happened in the controlled schools.  We need to build capacity in schools in order that pupils and parents will want to go to these schools and will not want to flee them to go to schools in the suburbs.  The issue of academic selection needs to be dealt with, but it will not be dealt with by confrontation.  Sadly, I do not see a solution to the dispute coming in Northern Ireland in the next few years.  We need to find ways of living with the reality and for both sides to stop the aggressive confrontational attitudes towards each other.  We need to find a way forward to live with the reality of academic selection until we can get rid of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100010#M01100","nonspeaker":"Reverend Trevor Gribben","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385036100,"counter":732,"content":"<p>I thank all three delegates; their attendance is much appreciated.

This broad representation reflects the membership of the Prison to Peace consortium.  In addition, the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland is the lead partner in the conflict transformation programme with the bottom-up consortium, a range of groups north and south of the Border which comprise former IRA prisoners.<\/p><p>  The Community Foundation for Northern Ireland has been engaged in its work for many years.  We began engaging with political ex-prisoners in 1995 with support from the European Union PEACE I programme and, subsequently, its successor programmes.  One of the reasons we are very keen to link this work with the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is the provision within the Agreement for proactive reintegration of former prisoners.  We are also very conscious of the important role played by ex-prisoners in achieving and selling the Agreement before and at the time of the referenda, within their particular constituencies and broader communities.<\/p><p>  One of our concerns is that we seem to be going backwards to some extent since 2000, in the aftermath of the rollercoaster that was the drive to achieve and implement a peace agreement.  We have seen the introduction of the historical inquiries team and other important measures, but, just as significantly, we have also seen an increased stereotyping of ex-prisoners as the ones solely at fault for the Troubles.  We have tried in our work during the years with former prisoners, one the one hand, and, on the other, victims and survivors of the Troubles to emphasise that they are not two distinct categories.  In fact, throughout Northern Ireland there are many people who were in prison and also were victims and survivors of political violence.  The notion of positing one group against the other is misguided.<\/p><p>  We began with the aim of reintegration of former prisoners into society, in accordance with the wording of the Good Friday Agreement.  In practice, however, the various groups have gone further than this and have been proactively involved in interface work and other aspects of peace-building.  The impact of their efforts can be seen in the cross-constituency, cross-community contact made between groups.  <\/p><p>  Another area of work that has always been very much to the fore is our engagement with young people, our message being that there is nothing glamorous about a return to the Troubles.  One of the projects the group has undertaken, with the support of the department of education at Queen's University and the subsequent endorsement of the Northern Ireland Department of Education, is the production of an education pack for schools exploring why people became involved in violence, what life was like for prisoners and why they now support the peace process.  The objective is to discourage another generation from becoming involved in violence.<\/p><p>  There are two issues that remain of major concern to us.  The first is that one of the issues preventing the reintegration of political ex-prisoners as full members of society is the retention of their criminal record which excludes them, for example, from employment in some instances, from obtaining insurance and consideration as adoptive parents.  We have campaigned to put legislation in place to address this issue.  In the meantime, people are being increasingly excluded by the unconscious application of legislation and policies on criminalisation.  This is having a serious impact on former prisoners.<\/p><p>  The second point of concern relates to funding.  The Community Foundation for Northern Ireland is an independent charitable trust which does not receive any statutory funding.  In fact, since its establishment in 1995, we have been left to negotiate funding from the European Union, the support of which has been very generous but not the most appropriate to the work engaged in by the ex-prisoner groups.  We are asking where the evidence is of any effort by the government to mainstream some of this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100012#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Avila Kilmurray"},{"type":"speech","time":1385036400,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Kilmurray.

In the current circumstances that prevail in this country, people who are still relatively young have to remain unemployed because they cannot access work outside the country in many areas as a result of their having been involved in the conflict.  That was emphasised legislatively in this House in the recent past and as a result people cannot even get a job as a taxi driver because they have been former prisoners of war, POWs.  In the Six Counties special political advisers were discriminated against because they had been prisoners in the conflict.  I would strongly argue that in respect of the Good Friday Agreement, all the negotiations on it and  the goodwill towards it, a great deal of convincing of people of its value came from the prisoners and former prisoners who worked within their communities to ensure it was acceptable across this island.<\/p><p>  I would like to think, and I expect Deputy Frank Feighan or any of the Deputies here would support me on this, that if Sinn F&eacute;in was in government down here and if I was part of the Sinn F&eacute;in team, either as a political adviser or as an elected representative, that there would be no doubt that my position would be accepted.  I find it insulting that people like Mary McArdle and Paul Kavanagh have found themselves outside the pale as a consequence of opportunistic political reasons motivated by one party trying to embarrass another.  I would like to get the delegates' views on that.  I hope we will make a strong argument in favour of getting rid of the \"records\", as they are called.  I think this committee should make representations to the Government regarding legislation that has come through that effectively categorises former political prisoners in the same category as child abusers, rapists and so forth.  I think that is terrible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100013#Q00100","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1385037000,"counter":740,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ferris for that.

Ms Avila Kilmurray set the context for this very well and I will be as brief as possible but I want to cover a number of points on behalf of our constituent part in the Prison to Peace and Conflict Transformation from the Bottom Up network.  This is the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and I was heartened by what Deputy Frank Feighan said, namely, that it is a powerful committee.  I do not mean to be smart but 15 years on from the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, I have to ask why has it not been implemented and why a number of the promises made in it and in the St. Andrews Agreement have not been implemented.  The Good Friday Agreement stated: &quot;The Governments continue to recognise the importance of measures to facilitate the reintegration - I have an issue with the word &quot;reintegration&quot; - of prisoners into the community by providing support both prior to and after release, including assistance directed towards availing of employment opportunities, re-training and\/or re-skilling, and further education.&quot;  A Bill went through these Houses which denies work to republican ex-prisoners.  A Bill, to which Deputy Martin Ferris alluded, went through Stormont which provides that somebody can be a Minister but cannot be a special adviser.  There is a great deal of nonsense about this.<\/p><p>  I wish to comment on a few issues that were raised.  We have written a fairly length submission to the Haass talks, the details of which I will not go into as it has been forwarded to them.  The submission set out clearly the political, historical context of colonialism.  We make no bones about that, that is where the conflict arose, but whether people can agree or disagree with actions, that is a different day's work. <\/p><p>  Ms Avila Kilmurray prepared a paper which is very helpful.  The number of republican ex-prisoners, and indeed loyalist ex-prisoners, vary from 15,000, as some people have said, to 40,000, as stated in some reports.  The figure of 40,000 comes from the British Home Officer and that excludes the period up to 1971 where there would have been several thousand people involved.  It is a massive number of people.  As Ms Avila Kilmurray stated in her document, when the families are taken into account, we are talking about a constituency of more than 200,000 people.  That is a massive constitutency of people affected by political imprisonment.<\/p><p>  &quot;Reintegration&quot; is not a word that republican ex-prisoners would use.  We understand people use different language and that is their language.  We would see ourselves as part of communities who have returned to communities.  While we have certainly settled back in again, &quot;reintegration&quot; is not a word that republicans would use.<br \/> I wish to comment on some of the issues mentioned.  With regard to political imprisonment and conflict-related convictions - again, this is language we use, and it is not criminal- but conflict-related convictions - this is included in employers' guidelines.  A committee in Stormont had to draw up guidelines for employers.  They have not been adopted by all employers, although some have adopted them.  Therefore, there has been some progress and that is the language used.  <\/p><p>  Anyone who has had a political conviction will have issues around employment, education, voluntary work, financial services even up to including pensions in that if a person is in jail there is not a continuance of his or her contributory pension.  The issue of ageing poverty has arisen.  Republic ex-prisoners, and I am sure the same applies to loyalist ex-prisoners, constitute an ageing population; they are in their 50s, 60s, and 70s.  That is the reality of the numbers involved and of the issues.<\/p><p>   On the issue of travel, political ex-prisoners have been refused travel.  I know some of this is outside the remit of this group but it should be lobby on this issue.  The USA, Canada and New Zealand will refuse travel to political ex-prisoners.  We met representatives of the Australian Embassy and we had a positive response from them.  The irony, as we pointed out, is that the their founding fathers were political prisons and that argument was not lost on them.  We had a good meeting and they have been very positive since it.<\/p><p>  Ms Avila Kilmurray has also touched on adoption and fostering.  Licences are also an issue, people can be arrested again and it can be written on their licence without any due regard to any evidence.  It is crazy and it is causing untold problems in the North.  If there is evidence against people that is one thing, but where people are arrested and no evidence is shown, that is creating problems and giving succour people who are opposed to the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>  Some of the issues on which I have touched are outside the remit of this committee but most of them are within it.  I cannot understand some of the provisions of legislation that has been introduced in the past 15 years and neither can our group understand it.  We are fully behind the process.  The war is over.  We are treated differently from former combatants.  Former combatants are not asked where they were during the 1970s or 1980s - they can travel, but we cannot.  We need to deal with those issues.  <\/p><p>  With regard to some of the things we have asked for in the Haass talks, and we are very clear about this, we have said that there needs to be an expunging of convict-related convictions.  The war is over, it is over and let us deal with it.  Not only are political ex-prisoners refused travel, their partners - we have documentation on this and we would be happy to pass it on to the committee - were refused travel because they were on the same ticket, children have been refused travel and in the last week grandchildren have been refused travel because of their parents or a parent having been sentenced as a result of the conflict in the North in the 1970s.  That is the time to which the sentence date back.  We are calling for the expunging of convict-related convictions.  We are also calling for - dare I use the word - an amnesty.  The expunging of records deals with those who have been in prison and an amnesty deals with those who may face prison.  We heard the latest comments yesterday from the Attorney General in North which caused concern, but the reality is that there has been a de facto amnesty for British forces.   Five of them went to prison and three of them are still in the British Army.  There is a disparity in how former combatants are dealt with.  <\/p><p>  I wish finish on this note as I know others want to speak.  There is a process called &quot;DDR2&quot;, demobilisation, demilitarisation and reinsertion.  It is used in most conflicts around the world.  It is a process that is used before those involved proceed to elections and the working outs post-conflict.  It did not happen here.  I understand it did not happen here because the Good Friday Agreement probably would not have been negotiated had that been pushed but that is what is used in countries.  There have been 550 plus amnesties granted since 1945 across the world.  There were amnesties granted in this State after the Civil War.  There has been a history of amnesties having been granted; it is not something new.  There was a recent provision in respect of the UN which states in regard to amnesties that an amnesty cannot be a blanket amnesty as that is illegal but if an amnesty is tied into weapons being put beyond use and tied into demobilising armies, then it is that.  There is detail on this.  These are the hard questions.  I know people say &quot;amnesty&quot; and then shy away from it but the reality is that the British state, the other side of this conflict, has had <i>de facto<\/i> amnesty. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100013#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Mulgrew"},{"type":"speech","time":1385037600,"counter":742,"content":"<p>Does anybody else wish to comment on the issues raised?

Reference was made to the lack of continuity for schemes depending on such programmes.  Such funding will be critically important given the challenges facing governments in terms of funding.  When we know the parameters of the new PEACE IV programme we should be in a position to support any programmes Ms Kilmurray puts forward for financial support.  She indicated that from the mid-1990s the European Union has been supportive of different peace building projects.  I recall very well meeting with officials from the European Commission at the time when Albert Reynolds was Taoiseach.  There was a particular drive at that time to ensure that the European Union supported the peace process.  Could Ms Kilmurray elaborate on the work of various groups with young people in terms of highlighting to them that there is no glamour attached to going back to violence?  Such information would give an indication of the value of the work.<\/p><p>  Ms Kilmurray mentioned in her publication that the work of the civic forum could be valuable from the point of view of giving another worthwhile forum to various groups to deal with issues outside the mainstream dealt with by parliamentary assemblies.  The most recent questions I asked in the D&aacute;il about the establishment of a civic forum appeared to suggest that the process was not advancing.  Perhaps that would change if Ambassador Haass and Meghan O&rsquo;Sullivan produce a report to that effect.  I do not know how the forum worked when it was in existence.  Did Ms Kilmurray engage meaningfully with the civic forum when it was in place?  It should offer good potential to various groups.  We spoke earlier about loyalist groups that might not be well represented in political fora, at local authority, Assembly or parliamentary level.  Deputy Ferris contributed on the point.  Could Ms Kilmurray elaborate on her views in terms of the potential of the civic forum?  We could provide support in terms of lobbying the Government and the British Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100014#R00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385037600,"counter":744,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome.  Ironically, we discussed the issue in January 2012.  I will be taking the lift today because I broke my leg in this building following the last meeting.  I will not take any chances today.  Since the last meeting two pieces of legislation have been introduced North and South to further discriminate against political prisoners.  Things seem to be moving backwards instead of forwards.  It is a double whammy for women who spent their reproductive years in prison.  Martina Anderson can be a Member of the European Parliament but she can never be a mother.  She is a fabulous daughter who looks after her own mother but she can never know what it feels like to have a child of her own because of the discrimination against political prisoners.  It is a huge injustice that any woman would not be given such an opportunity.  Adoption and fostering need to be on a par with insurance.  Unfortunately, for many women demographics are now working against them and time is against them.  Fifteen years on from the Good Friday Agreement it is a sin that the situation is maintained.  It is immoral and women in particular are being punished as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100014#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Michelle Gildernew"},{"type":"speech","time":1385037600,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I wish to follow up on the issue raised by Ms Gildernew.

PEACE IV is very welcome.  For obvious reasons, at the moment the emphasis is largely on young people and unemployment.  Some focus should be on issues relating to ex-prisoners.  PEACE funding is best used for project work.  It does not have to require a big budget.  Core funding would allow the continuity of groups.  That goes back to the Executive.  The Community Foundation for Northern Ireland has written on a number of occasions to seek meetings with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister but we have only received acknowledgements not meetings.  My organisation has been acting as lead partner for the PEACE programme in terms of the prisoner work.  We are getting to the stage where we are not going to do it anymore because we feel we are being used as a comfort blanket for lack of political decision making.<\/p><p>  I have mixed views on the civic forum.  It is useful potentially as a form of participative democracy.  As we heard at the end of the last session, there is lack of representation from a number of areas and a civic forum might be able to address that in an affirmative manner.  It would be complementary to politics because a civic forum could look at some issues that it is difficult for the elected parties to address at the moment in terms of trying to tease out some ideas following the Haass report when it comes.

I am not winking at anyone; I have a twitch in my eye.  Primarily, the decision made by Lisburn People&rsquo;s Support Project, PSP, at the beginning of our involvement was that there was a need to de-glamourise the conflict.  A large section of young people feel that in many ways they missed out on the conflict.  There is an irony which suggests that in many ways it has been glamourised.  The work we did in connection with the flags protest is a great example of what we have done.  We were lucky in Lisburn that the trouble in Belfast did not spread but it took a lot of work to ensure that was the case.  We asked young people about their plans and what they would do if they were pushed off the street.  We told them a story about how things would develop.  The difficulty with the prison experience and the conflict is that in many ways they have been romanticised.  Every single television programme or film made about the conflict refers at some stage to the great camaraderie in prison.  That is true, but nobody tells about what happens when the cell door closes and one is alone or one&rsquo;s family is falling apart.<\/p><p>  To develop on the point made by Ms Gildernew, for a man fathering children is an issue as becoming a mother is an issue for a woman.  We spend a lot of time de-glamourisng the conflict.  In a similar vein, I was looking at phase two of the project and the work we have done for the progress report.  I have run more than 17 programmes, 13 of them have been with women and young people.  They were all based around the de-glamourisation of the conflict and the pitfalls in terms of getting involved.  I tell them that getting involved in conflict might affect their ability to travel and ten years down the line such involvement might seem remiss.  Many young people that were involved in the on-street protests will encounter a problem further down the line in terms of travel.<\/p> <p>We believe our conscious decision to work with young people to deglamourise the conflict and the romanticism behind it has been a great success.

It might be helpful were the witnesses to provide formally to the joint committee a list of such barriers, which hopefully could then put it through the relevant Government structures.  Do the witnesses perceive the difficulty in part to be that the process came out of the Good Friday Agreement and that different individuals were then involved in the parties that signed up to the Good Friday Agreement, namely, the two Governments?  It probably is easier for such people, be they from the Conservative Party, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or whatever, to state another Government was in office at that time.

Many legacy issues have been talked about and the point has been made that if they are not resolved, one always will be an ex-prisoner because one will carry them with one all one's life - be they in respect of employment, travel, insurance or seeking to adopt.  In response to the Deputy's question, they always will be there.  Consequently, we have done a lot of work on advocacy and have been working with the Northern Ireland Civil Service in an effort to put in place various programmes and to introduce voluntary acts for taking on people who have records, as we call it, to the effect that they will not be taken into account before 1998.<\/p><p>  However, I wish to raise the issue about trying to sustain the work of Prison to Peace and not being obliged to try to apply for funding through the various bodies in a reactionary way and not to be pigeonholed into the peace programme, because we develop far more work than that and it now is well highlighted that the work should be mainstreamed.

If major parties - I do not simply refer to big house unionism in this regard - across the island do not accept there was a conflict, regardless of how they come to that point, then they will not deal with issues pertaining to the legacy of the conflict.  Before one starts, the debate must get around that and while people will come out with different views, that is fine.  Another issue with regard to funding is there is a massive disparity of approach to former combatants.  British State forces have got somewhere close to &pound;2 billion.  While no one suggests they should not get it, it is &pound;2 billion.  When one considers the PEACE money for the large numbers involved, it is welcome but it is a pittance.  Moreover, I agree with Ms Avila Kilmurray that it probably is not the mechanism that should be used for this.  However, given the financial state of affairs, especially in this State, there is no money there to grab and it certainly will not be allocated to dealing with political ex-prisoners in this jurisdiction.  It simply will not happen.  As for the PEACE IV money that is available, there has been a lot of lobbying in Brussels to try to exclude political prisoners from it.  The DUP and others have been over there lobbying extensively to try to get that stopped and this also needs to be challenged because this work must continue.  If it is not continued, people will still try to keep those engagements.  We would continue to work with all different groupings here, with all sections of society and all communities, because there are loads of different communities and loads of different issues.  However, limitations arise when one does not have staff in place or does not have programme costs and so on.<\/p><p>  The other issue in this regard is there will be a gap between PEACE III and PEACE IV.  There always has been a gap, there always are delays of a year, 18 months or two years.  Where will that be picked up?  In the North, the last time it was picked up by some moneys obtained from the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.<\/p> <p>Obviously, that did not transmit to the Southern groups because their remit did not extent that line on the map.  These are real issues.<\/p><p> At this stage, we are set to finish in May.  We still are owed 23% of the funding and have been told we might know in February or March.  That is not good enough.  It will take us to the end of 2014 and PEACE IV will probably not be in place for another year to 18 months thereafter.<\/p><p> These are only practical issues.

The conditions alluded to for an amnesty have been met in that weapons have been put beyond use and the organisations have been disbanded - they have been stood down.  At what point will I get what I voted for when I voted for the Good Friday Agreement - a Bill of Rights - which will tell me that I am a citizen?  When do I stop being an ex-prisoner?  I have been out of prison for almost 40 years and have not broke the law since.<\/p><p>  The point Ms Gildernew made is one that I, as a male, have never grasped as to the effect on those such as Ms Martina Anderson and I am sure there are many more like her.  I am fortunate in that I am a parent and do not have to adopt.  I had three at once and I am not going to through that again.<\/p><p>  From where do I get my rights as a citizen?  I am asked to pay my taxes; I am told I can vote, but I cannot get what I want.  If I want to take out insurance, I have to declare my past.  I will have to pay an excess or else I will not have insurance.  I am also denied employment opportunities.  What is the point in re-skilling to do a specific job and someone turns around and tells me he or she is sorry but because of something I did at 22 years of age, I cannot avail of an employment opportunity?  Has the Good Friday Agreement delivered for the ex-prisoner community?  It is debatable, but in some ways, yes.  On the fundamentals, a Bill of Rights would guarantee us full citizenship, something to which we are entitled.  If I was a rapist and out of prison the 30 odd years I have been out of prison, I could write on an application form that I had no convictions, but my conviction stays with me and will never be spent.  We are a special case.  If we were convicted in a special court, we are a special case and that case needs to be looked at.  As to whether the answer is an amnesty, expunging or deleting records, I do not know the answer to that question, but something has to be done.  We would not be where we are were it not for the contribution of the ex-prisoner community, as well as members of the ex-combatant community who are sometimes overlooked and are living in fear.  I cannot be judged again for the things I did but others can.  <\/p><p>  The HET was mentioned.  Is there any trust in it after the revelations about the way that some persons had been followed with more vigour than others?<\/p><p>  There is still much to be done.  A start would be a Bill of Rights that would guarantee me the hope of full citizenship, to which I, as a citizen, should be entitled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100016#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Roderic Dunbar"},{"type":"speech","time":1385038800,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dunbar for his input.

We need to begin to put that matter in context and look at it through the lenses of poverty, social isolation, social injustice and, as Mr. Dunbar stated, rights.  These all are important lenses through which to look at this issue.<\/p><p>  The figure Professor Shirlow threw out was 40,000.  If we multiply that figure by five for dependants such as family members, children and grandchildren, we arrive at a figure of 200,000 persons within the communities on whom there have been secondary impacts in terms of their pension rates and reduced employment options.  It does not stop merely with the prisoner but percolates into the wider community.  We have never really measured that impact.  It is no co-incidence that in the communities from which we come there are high levels of poverty and deprivation and people are effectively prisoners of the past.<\/p><p>  A high percentage of those who joined paramilitary organisations and became involved in the conflict went on to become prisoners, but there is also hidden discrimination against former combatants.  We can measure some of the discrimination against us, but we are less successful in measuring it against our children that we know occurs.  In terms of security forces files still held perhaps on persons in our communities, are they still used?  In these terms, there are many perceptions.<\/p><p>  All of this occurs against the backdrop of communities that experienced the full spectrum of social injustice in terms of health and education services and unemployment.  On the forging of frugal and regressive mindsets within the community that are being expressed, we have described it as a socioeconomic explosive placed in a political vacuum and primed with an identity fuse.  Politics is not delivering at the grassroots and identity is used as a camouflage.  Politics needs to start to deliver through providing for equal citizenship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100016#T00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Howcroft"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385038800,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I am from EPIC Belfast which supports former UVF prisoners.  There are a couple of points to be made.<\/p><p>  In terms of what should have been implemented under section 10 of the Good Friday Agreement, on a personal level, I was released under the terms of the Agreement in October 1998.  A few months after I was released, I received a letter from the tax office stating if I paid &pound;9,000, I would be entitled to a bigger percentage of my old age pension when I reached pension age.  As I had only been out a few months, I did not have &pound;9,000 and there was not a hole in the wall from which I would get it.  Even if I had had &pound;9,000, I would only have been entitled to a pension of approximately 40% or 50%.  That is what that means.  I have been out 15 years, all but six months of which have been spent in full-time employment.  Somebody could leave school at years of age and through no fault of his or her own might not be able to find a job and remain unemployed throughout his or her working life.  At 65 years of age he or she would be entitled to a full old age pension, yet I could work - God willing - for the next ten years until I was near retirement age and still not be entitled to receive even a figure of 50%.  Is there anybody in this room who would see this as anywhere close to being fair?  That is only one aspect.<\/p><p>  In 2007 I was invited to Indonesia to work in its peace process after the 2005 tsunami.  It was funded by US Aid and I worked in Banda Aceh.  It was a great learning experience and eye-opener, but as those who funded it were part of an arm of government, I was not let travel to Miami, Florida to visit Disney World.  I could help to build peace in Indonesia, but I could not go to Florida for a fortnight with my daughter to see Mickey Mouse.  These are small issues that might not mean a great deal to members of the committee.<\/p><p>  Ms Kilmurray made a point on core funding.  It is no mistake that much of the peace-building work, particularly in connection with ex-prisoners and ex-combatants, is not core-funded.  It is not done by chance but by design.  I worked on a cross-community project - Interaction - that used be called the Springfield Inter-Community Development Project, SICDP.  Its work was of vital importance.<\/p> <p>It was particularly vital in the new millennium when politicians were unable to agree a way forward in terms of power-sharing in the Assembly.  Many ex-prisoners and ex-combatants engaged in what we would call the real peace-building work on the ground.  We filled the vacuum that would have been filled by people who wanted to take us backwards instead of forwards.  That was never recognised.  I am not here with a begging bowl by any means; I will wash cars if I have to.  The point is that we do not know what will happen this time next year because we always have to look over our shoulders.  Part of the problem is that one is not able to focus fully on what one should be focusing, namely, on how we can have positive impacts, especially on the young, in order to take people away from a road that many of us felt we had to go down years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100016#T00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Large","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385039400,"counter":767,"content":"<p>A point raised concerned the business of the past and charges that might well be made against certain individuals at some stage consequent on certain revelations or forensic examinations, for example.  There is no general agreement anywhere on how this should be dealt with in the North.  Republicans and probably most individuals present have a specific view that whatever happened in the past happened.  If the war is over, it is over.  One is not going to get people to come forward to talk about their role in the conflict if, by doing so, they will end up in jail again.  It is simply not going to happen; therefore, people have to be honest about it.<\/p><p>  I realise certain individuals among the victims community do not particularly want the truth; they want people like me to be put back in jail.  If I have not served my time for everything in which I was ever involved, they believe I should be put back in jail.  It is not going to happen in the sense that I can get up and talk about my activities in the IRA simply because I have been in jail.  I can talk about stuff I was involved in that led to my going to jail.  However, no one can talk about everything else that happened in the conflict if it means going back to jail.  This is because there is no Statute of Limitations for what happened during the conflict.  If people demand the truth about a certain incident, people like me will simply say they are not getting it on the grounds that we would be put back in jail.  A section of society is crying out for what it regards as closure, but it cannot have closure if it means people are going to go back to jail.  That is just the position for us.  In addition, one must bear in mind everything that the state was involved in over the course of the conflict, particularly in the North.  As Mr. Mulgrew stated, approximately five British soldiers went to jail as a result of killings.  The state has always covered its own back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100017#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. S&eacute;anna Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385039400,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I am from the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland.  I manage the two PEACE programmes that we operate.  I have a point I believed somebody else might have brought up.  <\/p><p>  Mr. Curry has raised the question that is asked as to why everybody does not just go home, have a cup of tea and forget about the matter on the basis that it is 15 years down the line.  He has referred to the questioning of what is the point in continuing with this work.  The impact and value of this work on the ground are very often missed outside the areas in which it is progressing.  There were three occasions in the past four years on which we could have slid back into serious shooting-related conflict in the North.  The first was when the policeman was killed, the second was when the two soldiers were killed and the third which occurred more recently was when the flag protest occurred at the beginning of this year.  When one is outside the communities, it is very easy to look at the television and see a terrible thing happening without being aware of the discussion around the table.  What one does not see is the discussion around the table in our office in Belfast.  The loyalist representatives said there was a massive demand in their communities for a backlash and to kill a few Catholics after the killing of the policeman and two soldiers.  There was a very lengthy discussion around the table and people went back into their communities and said there was no support for the activities in the republican community.  That message had to be brought back by representatives of the loyalist community.  There is no point in the likes of Mr. Walsh, Mr. Mulgrew, Mr. Gallagher or Mr. Dunbar saying there is no support; the message has to come from the representatives of the loyalist communities.  The latter representatives, because of their background and because they are former prisoners, commanded a lot of respect and had a lot of clout in their communities.  When on two occasions they went back to those communities and said there was no support for the activities in question, the lid was put back on a very dangerous situation.<\/p><p>  On another occasion there was a rumour that the INLA was to attack an Orange Order march that would be passing Ardoyne.  The response within loyalist communities was,\"To hell it will; we will go up to Ardoyne and sort that out.\"  Again, there was discussion around a table and the representatives from the INLA constituency assured the loyalist representatives that there was no truth to the rumour.  The rumour had been circulated by the Northern edition of one of the more irresponsible newspapers in the country.  People went back into their communities and said what had been rumoured would not happen.  It was a case of calling a war and nobody coming, with the consequence being no trouble in Ardoyne.<\/p><p>  One saw what was happening on the street during the flag protest.  At the Short Strand-Lower Newtownards interface, events were at the point where there was real potential for somebody to be killed.  The sectarian element was developing.  The former IRA, ex-combatant, ex-prisoner constituents sent 100 men to the Short Strand to stop the response or attack - whichever way one views it - coming from that community.  Colleagues supporting former UDA prisoners did tremendous work at the interface.  This is possibly the case with some of the UVF representatives, but I know the UDA representatives pulled it back.  From the outside, people saw the trouble vanishing, but they did not hear the dialogue.<\/p><p>  There is a constant, simmering undercurrent in the North that can be ignited very easily by the smallest event.  We are now in a set of circumstances in which there is a lid on a number of matters.  There is much discussion and debate taking place and there is a lot of work being done by the people sitting around tables that are not seen.  One can never prove the riot or killing that did not happen.  I am outlining the battles people have all the time.  There was no trouble on Shankill Road when there was trouble in east Belfast.  People expressed their surprise, but they did not realise why there had been no trouble there, in Lisburn and the area Mr. Gardiner covers in Derry.  They did not see the work done on the ground.  Without the project groups, there would be a massive vacuum within working class areas.  People on the island do not realise how important it is to maintain this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100017#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n de Bar&oacute;id"},{"type":"speech","time":1385039400,"counter":769,"content":"<p>The submissions made by the groups represented are among the most powerful the committee has received.

Negotiations took place over three and a half days which, on the eve of the Apprentice Boys' parade, had the potential to create major sectarian violence.  The ramifications and fallout could have spread but my colleagues and I took that risky gamble to ensure that sectarian strife did not ensue in the streets of Londonderry.<\/p><p>  Deputy Seamus Kirk raised the question of retraining and upskilling.  One can try one's best to work with limited resources.  I have 49 ex-prisoners who are involved through EPIC.  They have done their SIA security training in licensed warehouse duties.  During Londonderry's City of Culture year they were able to get casual and sustainable employment for a year.  The question is what happens thereafter.  Are ex-prisoners going to be discriminated against?  As it stands, the ex-prisoner consortium is a disparate group, but their community is also maligned and castigated by sections within the community.  <\/p><p>  It was stated that this committee has no representation from the Unionist and loyalist community.  The Official Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party are very good at castigating loyalism and those involved in the From Prison to Peace Partnership.  The ladies and gentlemen around this table have taken risks to ensure that the peace process is kept on track.  Mr. de Bar&oacute;id alluded to the murder of two British soldiers at Massereene Barracks and the subsequent murder of two PSNI officers.  It should be borne in mind that there have been 63 shooting incidents in Londonderry in the past few years, so all is not well in the garden.<\/p><p>  In Northern Ireland at present we have an issue concerning parades and flag protests.

Essentially, the political ex-prisoners have fallen through the fault line in terms of the inability to deal with the past.  As a result, they have taken the predominance of the blame.  The inability to deal with the past comes down to something this committee can take up between the British and Irish governments.  There is a conflicting narrative whereby on the one hand it was described as an aggravated crime wave, while on the other hand it was described as a political struggle or war.  Until that is dealt with, everything else falls captive to our inability to look at that.<\/p><p>  As regards dealing with the past, the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland is trying to look at some sort of shared history through prisoners' eyes.  We have interviewed a lot of them.  One of the things that comes out strongly is that they say their involvement was not over a particular incident or ideology, but was due to the circumstances they found themselves in.  Particularly on the loyalist side, people said that political speeches created the conditions they found themselves in.<\/p><p>  As regards criminal records, I attended meetings from 2002 with the direct rule minister, Mr. David Hanson.  We were seeking legislation and it was argued that we should go for a voluntary code of practice.  Since 2007, we have been meeting with the head of the Northern Ireland civil service and have made some small gains, but there are still outstanding issues.  Something has to be done about that.<\/p><p>  Mainstream government core funding is needed for essential office and running costs, as well as essential co-ordination.  The Peace IV programme comes in with broader programmatic costs.  Because of a lack of funding this time last year, we had two groups - one from the republican side and the other from the loyalist side - working voluntarily without wages.  They were in danger of losing their houses.  I went up to the civil service to say that we would erect a cross-community tent on the grounds of Stormont to shelter those who had been made homeless due to the lack of continuity in funding.  That remains a major issue and will certainly come up again.<\/p><p>  It has taken many years of work and courage to get the Prison to Peace group working together.  It is a model of what we hoped would emerge from the Good Friday Agreement.  Ex-prisoners who had previously set out to kill each other were actually working together to maintain the peace process.  I was talking to Jackie McDonald yesterday and he said that, given the current sensitivities and tensions, there are people within their communities who, if this work does not continue and is not more robustly supported, will say: \"We told you.  You took the risks.  You put your necks out but they let you fall by the wayside.\"  There are dangers involved in the practical situation on the ground, as well as in how communities will respond if this sort of work is not maintained somehow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100018#V00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Avila Kilmurray"},{"type":"speech","time":1385040000,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I think you are a Strabane man, Paul, are you not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100018#V00400","speaker":"997"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385040000,"counter":774,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2013112100018#V00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Gallagher"},{"type":"speech","time":1385040000,"counter":775,"content":"<p>On Monday, I learned that there are 300 ex-combatants in Strabane alone, which is not a big place.

Logic dictates that if the latter is true, then it should also be a cost-saving measure in respect of the over 70s.<\/p> <p>Proposing a reduction in the number of people over 70 who will quality does not make economic sense if one follows the Minister's basic argument on free GP care for children under five.  I do not like going back too far, but three years ago when an eligibility threshold of &euro;1,400 a week was introduced it was described by those now in government as a damning attack on older people.  If &euro;1,400 per week is a damning attack on elderly people surely a reduction to &euro;900 is a complete assault on them and their ability to access health care.  I supported the introduction of the &euro;1,400 threshold and we were vilified for it, perhaps, one could argue, rightly so.  I cannot understand how the Minister can state this will not impact on many people.  It will impact hugely and significantly on people who are over 70.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill is before the D&aacute;il today.  This is with regard to changes in the budget on tax relief for private health insurance.

They will not be able to access medical care through the medical card system.  The Minister has not thought this through.

For all these reasons, the Bill is distasteful to say the very least because it will reduce the number of people who will qualify for medical cards.

I am absolutely opposed to the legislation in its entirety.  It is not amendable in any shape or form.  It was a great disappointment to me because I was very happy to record my support for the provision of free GP care for all children aged five and under as announced in the recent budget.  This was something I commended, and I indicated I was willing and happy to support it as long as it was part of a programme to introduce free GP care across the board and that we had a plan.  I have not heard the plan, but the proposition entailed in the Bill undermines the credibility of the measure.  Not only are we looking at a situation where &euro;37 million has been provided with regard to the roll-out of free GP care to children aged under five, but &euro;149 million in total is being taken out of the medical card budget.  This is absolutely massive and the Bill relates to a significant part of this with regard to those aged over 70 whose income thresholds exceed &euro;500 per week for a single person or a person living alone and &euro;900 per week for a couple together.  It beggars belief why this approach has been taken and has already demonstrated very serious consequences for ordinary decent people who had the reasonable expectation they would be able to continue to have the comfort and assurance of their medical card entitlement.<\/p><p>  On its introduction we had universal over 70 entitlement.  The previous Government wanted to restrict this and the Minister went ballistic when he was sitting beside me in the Opposition benches a very short period of time past.  As a result of public demonstration, and great commendation to all of the older people who mobilised at the time, the former Government capitulated and introduced thresholds.  Again, Deputy James Reilly showed, as I did, strong opposition to a particular cut off, wanting to see universal access as the cornerstone of our respective party policies as I would have understood it.  Now he is in government the Minister, and the Minister of State as one of his support Deputies, has proposed not one but two further significant reductions in these thresholds, reducing them first to &euro;600 and &euro;1,200 from &euro;700 and &euro;1,400 respectively and now, in this particular instance, with regard to the budget for 2014, a further reduction of &euro;100 for a single person and a reduction of &euro;300 for a couple, in terms of entitlement, from &euro;1,200 to &euro;900, which no longer keeps the equilibrium with regard to the entitlement of a couple together being twice that of a single person.  It is most disappointing and has caused huge disquiet.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt people are battle weary.  They have taken so much over recent years in a succession of austerity budgets.  Do not take any comfort from the fact there has not been a replication of the huge demonstrations which presented a short number of years ago, and that in some way this is an indication of acceptance.<\/p> <p>It is not.  People are beaten down.  While there has been significant mobilisation and protest on what the Bill seeks to do, that in no way reflects what I know to be the reality of thinking on the issue, not only among those directly affected, namely, those within the over-70s cohort of our respective communities, but people across the board of all ages.  The Minister should make no mistake - I am within a decade of such an age myself, and we all aspire to reach those august ages - the measure has created great disquiet.  It will impose significant hurt and pain on many people who are being hit by a variety of measures contained in budget 2014.<\/p><p> Older people and younger people have been specifically targeted by the measures contained in the recent budget.  A Government Deputy I know and respect was very happy to boast to me that the centre ground had been left intact and that the Government had not hit too hard a particular body of people in terms of age and income.  That is not entirely true but it is true that they have been less affected than those of senior years and young people who find it difficult to secure work in this country.<\/p><p> There is no meeting of minds or centre ground in this regard.  That is why I chose not to offer any amendment.  I am absolutely opposed to what is entailed.  It runs totally contrary to the Minister of State's stated intent on the roll out of universal health care.  It is a most regressive measure.  This is not a proud moment for the Minister of State in political life nor for his colleagues in government.  It will have a hugely injurious impact on the fortunes of both Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the upcoming county council and European parliamentary elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100004#C00600","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385036400,"counter":821,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in should speak on the Bill rather than the elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100005#D00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1385036400,"counter":822,"content":"<p>A Chathaoirligh, make no mistake, it will have such an effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100005#D00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1385036400,"counter":823,"content":"<p>That is not in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100005#D00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1385036400,"counter":824,"content":"<p>Does that aspect of it please Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100005#D00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1385036400,"counter":825,"content":"<p>No, that is not the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100005#D00600","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1385036400,"counter":826,"content":"<p>We are speaking on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100005#D00700","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1385036400,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I am speaking on the Bill.

It is essentially a legislative piece of hypocrisy at variance with all Government policy.  It goes back to a 2008 decision by Fianna F&aacute;il to introduce a similar regime.  We all recall the current Minister&rsquo;s position at the time.  He used the term &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; to describe the proposal by the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government at the time.  The Taoiseach was equally strong in his condemnation.  The words, &ldquo;shame, shame, shame&rdquo; come to mind.  The T&aacute;naiste said something like &ldquo;How dare Fianna F&aacute;il do this to the elderly people of Ireland?&rdquo;  Those two parties &ndash; Fine Gael and the Labour Party &ndash; went on to make even more extensive commitments in the 2011 general election and in the programme for Government.  The thrust of the approach was to be universal health care and free access to GP services for all.  The Bill rolls back on that.  It is part of the targeting of elderly people by the Government.  I refer also to such measures as prescription charges, the abolition of the telephone allowance, the reduction in the heating and energy allowances and the recent abolition of the bereavement grant.<\/p><p>  The cuts are effectively cost-saving measures.  It is unnecessary to take this step as there are other areas that could be tackled, for example, the significant number of wealthy people in the country.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, told us recently that this is the seventh wealthiest country in the world.  In a reply I received from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the top 20,000 earners have an average annual income of &euro;476,000.  The income and assets of significant numbers of people in this country have increased during the recession.  I would have expected that the Government would have looked to them for savings if such savings were necessary.<\/p><p>  It is also part of the overall attack on medical card holders.  There has been a reduction of &euro;149 million and that is affecting 170,000 medical card holders.  Of those, 35,000 are in the over-70s age group and 22,000 have lost cards due to a return to employment and then there is the so-called &euro;113 million of probity.  I will not support the legislation.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in that regard.<\/p><p>  I wish to make one other comment on services for the holders of medical cards.  I wrote to the Minister about it on a number of occasions and I raised it last week in the D&aacute;il.  I refer to the situation that is now arising countrywide where GPs charge for services that were heretofore free for people with medical cards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100005#D01400","speaker":"960"},{"type":"speech","time":1385036400,"counter":834,"content":"<p>We are on section 1.

Colleagues also made the point that these measures are proposed to the D&aacute;il in the context of the necessity to make significant financial savings in the health area.  This is where the proposal has come from and I do not for one moment deny that such is the case.  Regrettably, there is a need.  Colleagues, in particular, Deputy Kelleher, will be aware why that is so and why the economic position is such that we must make savings, including in the health system.<\/p><p>  The savings that have been put forward this year in the context of the health budget have been designed as far as possible not to impact on front-line activity and to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected, and that is how the Government has proceeded.<\/p><p>  As members will be aware, the GMS is one of the areas that has been identified under budget 2014 for the savings that are required to be made.  Over recent years there has been a significant expansion in the GMS scheme.  The total cost of GMS services provided to over 70s medical card holders is approximately &euro;750 million per year, which represents over one third of the total cost of the GMS scheme.  In circumstances where, regrettably, savings must be achieved, there is no reality to the suggestion that we could not look to this area as providing some of those savings, and that is what we have done.<\/p><p>  There are approximately 350,000 individuals aged 70 years and over who currently hold a medical card.  It is estimated that the budgetary measure proposed here will move approximately 35,000 persons from a medical card to a GP visit card.  In response to Deputy Kelleher, I have not stated that this would have no impact.  The Government has not stated that it would have no impact.  It would be nonsensical for the Government to state that a measure would have no impact.  We have not said so.  What we stated is that it will affect one in ten of over 70s medical card holders who are - the term \"better-off\" is a relative term - the better-off 10% of current over 70s medical card holders.  As a consequence, the overwhelming majority of over 70s medical card holders will be unaffected by this Bill.<\/p><p>  It would be preferable not to have to make these changes.  There is nobody coming in here celebrating this proposal.  It is being put before the Oireachtas as a necessary saving, but it will affect only the higher income over 70s, if I may describe them as such, who currently hold a medical card.<\/p><p>  I will address this issue that is raised consistently by Deputies Kelleher, &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Healy and others, namely, that this runs contrary to the Government's plan in respect of universal access to GP care.  Deputy Healy made the point that it was at variance with Government policy and that it constituted a roll-back on free GP services for all.  It does no such thing because nobody, not a single individual, is losing free access to his or her GP from this measure.<\/p><p>  Measures proposed by Government are open to criticism from the Opposition.  The Opposition must do its job in that regard.  I do not challenge the members in that respect, but we must get the facts straight.  It is not contrary to the plan for universal access to GP care without fees because nobody is losing free access to his or her GP as a consequence of this measure because every individual who is moved from a full medical card will have a GP card.  There is no separate test, or anything else, for it.  It is automatic that any individual who loses out as a result of this change will have a GP card.<\/p><p>  The plan is universal access to GP services without fees.  That is the proposal that we are bringing forward.  That is the proposal with which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in states he agrees, and I thank him for that.  That is the proposal that many think is the correct way to proceed in terms of how we adjust our health care services into primary care, that we do not charge persons for attending their GP.  Nothing that we are doing today undermines that.  Members should stick to the facts of the matter.  There are many other measures for which we can be criticised but we have not taken away free access to a GP from any individual, neither in this measure nor in the measure that we brought in last year.  Everybody retains a GP card.  There is much that we can debate and much on which we can disagree, but we cannot disagree on that because those are the plain facts of the matter.  I would appeal to colleagues to note that such is the case.<\/p><p>  On the over 70s who will be affected by this measure, I remind colleagues that under the drugs payment scheme the HSE will meet the prescription drug costs of those persons without a medical card who face drugs costs higher than the DPS threshold of &euro;144 per month.  This means that a single person aged 70 with a gross income of over &euro;500 a week or a couple with an income of over &euro;900 a week will have their expenditure on prescription drugs capped at approximately &euro;33 per week.  It is true that they will lose out on the free drugs if they move from the full card to the GP card, but they will still have coverage from the DPS, which sees their drugs capped at approximately &euro;33 per week.  Those are the facts of the matter.<\/p><p>  When Deputy Kelleher spoke earlier about the long-term benefits of universal access to GP services, he made the point about the cost and asked how this could be regarded as a cost when we all are trying to move towards universal access.  I welcome his support for universal access to GP services, if that, in fact, is his position.  However, as I stated previously in this committee, it will not be possible for us to change overnight a system that we have had for so long which is based on means testing and section 45 of the 1970 Act.  We must change this system gradually, particularly given that we face such financial constraints.<\/p><p>  We are faced with a situation which, perhaps, is paradoxical.  In some ways, maybe it can be described as contradictory that we must make savings in the current system that we are managing but we must look to the future, plan and resource as best we can, even in a modest way, the kind of changes that we need to make a fundamental change to the way the health system is managed and its services are allocated.  That is why I support and have brought forward the proposal on universal access to GP care without fees.  That is why I say this is not contrary to that.  If any of the individuals affected by this measure was losing free access to his or her GPs, the case could be made that the measure would be contradictory to our plan but that is not what is happening.<\/p><p>  We are faced with a situation where we must make savings.  We are doing that in the best way possible consistent with having to make these savings.  It is affecting the top 10% of over 70s medical card holders.  They all will still keep their GP cards.  They will still have access to the DPS scheme meaning that their drugs will cost no more than &euro;33 per week.  It is not contrary to what we are trying to do in terms of the universal roll out.  For those reasons, I would commend the Bill to the House.<\/p><p>  It is never especially palatable to change eligibility in this way.  It is necessary in order to achieve the savings that the Government must achieve.  On that basis, I would ask the committee to support it.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Healy's point about the doctors, I wish to reassure him, as I did in the House the other day.  There have been some complaints raised by the Deputy and others.  The HSE has raised this issue with the IMO.  The rules are clear.  There is no basis for some of the charges that one has heard about.<\/p> <p>If somebody requires a blood test as part of the normal diagnostic process, he or she cannot and should not be charged.  If it is happening, we need to know about it.  We have raised the issue with the IMO.  In more general terms, it points to the need for a new contract with doctors.  This is another job in which I am very much engaged.  In so far as there is a lack of clarity in this area, there should be clarification in a new contract, to which the Government is committed to achieving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100006#E00100","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385037600,"counter":844,"content":"<p>We could be going around in a circle for the day.

I can go through it line by line.  It states:<blockquote><br \/>Where&mdash;(<i>a<\/i>) a person&mdash;<blockquote>(i) was married to another person until that other person&rsquo;s death,<br \/>(ii) was living with another person as husband and wife until that other person&rsquo;s death, or<br \/>(iii) was a civil partner as respects another person until that other person&rsquo;s death...<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>Everything in the section is at complete variance with and runs contrary to all of the stated polices in the programme for Government, as announced in 2011.  The idea that the proposal is a cost-saving measure that the Government could not have foreseen is patent nonsense.  It is a U-turn of enormous proportions.  I must be repetitive about this because we were told the eligibility criterion, involving an income limit of &euro;1,400 per week for a married or cohabiting couple, would affect people's ability to gain access to services, thus having a negative effect on their health.  We were told this clearly, but we are now being told by the Minister that a limit of &euro;900 is not that bad.  It will obviously put huge pressure on more families.  <\/p><p>  The last line of the provision states: &quot;their combined gross income limit is &euro;900 per week, not including the income from the portion of their savings or similar investments whose capital value does not exceed &euro;72,000&rdquo;.  People over 70 years are resilient and resourceful.  The T&aacute;naiste said previously that they had marched for civil liberties, women's rights, pay equality and, only a few years ago and also a few weeks ago, for the entitlement to a medical card.  We now find their income threshold is being reduced.  On top of this, there are issues that will obviously have a detrimental impact on their health.  If one does not have a medical card, one receives a GP card, but the GP refers a person to hospital, where he or she will be charged &euro;80 per night up to a maximum of ten nights in the year, totalling a maximum of &euro;800.  There are charges being imposed all the time by stealth on persons who will have to gain access to health care without a medical card.  This will have an impact on their health.  The prescription-only charge will have an impact.<\/p><p>  I am speaking to the Bill.  I tabled amendments that were ruled out of order, but I have conceded that the concept of universality has been breached by us previously.  To be consistent, I am asking the Government to raise the threshold to the original &euro;1,400 per week per person.  That is fair and rational and it would, in some way, be constructive.  The idea that a figure of &euro;1,400 was terrible for people, while &euro;900 is not so bad rings very hollow.<\/p><p>  The 35,000 people affected have a fixed income at their stage in life.  Their earning capacity is no longer such that extra income can be generated.  Their savings' capital value must not exceed &euro;72,000 and they now have a property tax on their house.  Therefore, their disposable income is greatly diminished already, yet we are asking them to pay &euro;80 per night when they go to hospital.  If one considers the profile of those over 70 years, one realises very many of them have private health insurance.  The cost of private health insurance will go up for the average family by &euro;350 to &euro;360 next year.  Many of the people in question, therefore, will not be able to afford private health insurance and will enter the public hospital system.  This runs contrary to what one would expect.  I cannot accept the Minister's arguments, primarily because I do not believe he believes in them himself and also because they run contrary to everything that was stated policy as recently as the time of drafting of the programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12013112100007#F00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1385037600,"counter":849,"content":"<p>Not everyone over 70 years is retired.

He indicated that he does not have any other options, but there are choices.  This is a wealthy country, although some people would have us believe that it is broke.  In October 2012, the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, told us that Ireland is the seventh wealthiest country in the world.  Independent CSO evidence indicates that the top 10% of people in this country have increased their income and assets during the course of this recession.  There is also clear information that the top 5% of wealthy people in this country have assets in the order of &euro;239 billion.<\/p><p>  The Government could have chosen to raise income from these areas, but it chose not to implement a tax on wealth or assets.  It also chose not to introduce a third rate of PAYE for higher earners.  Some months ago, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, told me that the top 20,000 earners in the country have an annual average income of &euro;476,000 each.  These are areas that could have been targeted by the Government for increased taxation.  Had that choice been made, it would have obviated the need to target elderly people's savings.<\/p><p>  The loss of a medical card does not simply mean the loss of free attendance at one's GP.  Medical card holders are entitled to access other services, including home help, appliances, day care centres, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.

Deputy Healy raised a fair point in the D&aacute;il recently and he has repeated it today.  In the circumstances he and others have outlined, there is no basis for doctors to impose extra charges.  The position is clear and it has been communicated to the IMO.  To the extent that it is necessary to do that again, it will be done.  If there are doubts about any of these areas, the time for them to be addressed is during the negotiations on a new contract.  The issue is being addressed by the HSE and I have no difficulty with the Deputy raising it and drawing it to my attention.<\/p><p>  In regard to savings, he addressed the broader political point in respect of the economic adjustments and the possibility of finding a fairer way.  It is interesting and important to debate who has been most affected by the economic downturn and the measures introduced by the Government.  I respect his refusal to accept that savings have to be made in the GMS but if he did accept our argument, he would agree this is the fairest way to do so.

There are slightly different schedules for applicants aged over 65 years.  In respect of the &euro;900 and &euro;500, I pointed out on Second Stage that the Government realises the living costs of an individual living alone are more than half those of a couple.

At the risk of being accused of being repetitive, we have already discussed the eligibility.  Under this section a person who has been notified that he or she is eligible for a medical card shall \"at any time after such notification, furnish to the Health Service Executive such information regarding that person&rsquo;s income and assets as the Health Service Executive considers necessary for it to establish if that person has or continues to have full eligibility.\"  This is the assessment process that will be put in place and the notification obligations of an individual.<\/p><p>  I must be very careful here because I do not wish to reflect on the individuals working in the primary care reimbursement centre working very diligently to try to assess people's eligibility but there are major difficulties and every Deputy would accept that.  Individuals are being randomly selected for a review process and they could be in their 80s or 90s.  Some time ago I raised the case of a 96 year old from Cavan who was being assessed after random selection by the computer.  I accept that if the legislation is passed there is a primary obligation to enforce it because the Parliament will have decided and it must be followed through.  However, would the Minister not think that profiling would be a better way of assessing people for eligibility than random selection?<\/p> <p>The idea that a 90 year old who is under huge pressure physically, bed bound and in full-time care would be randomly selected to furnish details that would invariably allow him or her to retain his or her medical card is bizarre.  Am I missing something here?  The Minister of State will have to examine this process of reviewing and requesting information because the random selection process is bizarre.  The Department's Estimate provides for the generation of &euro;113 million through the probity audit and there is no doubt it will be vigorously enforced through the review process.  Medical card reviews should be undertaken on a profiling basis and on the basis of high risk as opposed to random selection through which people will be picked out who invariably will retain their medical card.  It would be fine to randomly select if there was a quick assessment made of whether a person was high risk.  Surely a 90 year old man is unlikely to be at high risk of being in breach of criteria for a medical card.

At the time, officials obviously felt their circumstances would not change significantly in the next period of years, which was a reasonable and common-sense position to take.  I question whether this is being done on a random basis, as I suspect it is being done on a blanket basis, given the number of reviews taking place.  These medical cards are being reviewed, even though the persons concerned are in their 80s and 90s.  For instance, the day before yesterday I was contacted by the daughter of an 85 year old lady who lived alone.  She has a medical card until 2020, but she received a review form in July.  She was in hospital at the time and did not see the form.  As a result, she did not return it, but she did not realise until she had to obtain medication that she no longer had a medical card without even the reasonable notification of a reminder.  If the review form is not returned for whatever reason, card holders do not even receive a reminder that they have not returned their forms and if they do not do so, they will lose their medical cards.  That is the least that could be done.  In 95% of cases there is no need to, or point in, reviewing the applications because, as Deputy Billy Kelleher said, they will retain their medical cards.  The HSE assessed them and took the view that they had a fixed income which would not change in the next number of years unless they won the lotto, which we cannot all win.  This issue needs to be examined.<\/p><p>  Assessments on medical grounds as opposed to those relating to general discretion where applicants exceed the income thresholds are taking weeks on end and, in some cases, the medical evidence provided by people with serious health conditions and who are slightly over the limit is sitting in a queue.

If this is agreed to by the committee, the same power will be extended to cover all medical cards issued in the future.<\/p><p>  There are a number of ways to review eligibility.

The third type is the so-called random review, while the fourth is use of the death event notification system which identifies the deceased and enables the cessation of capitation payments in cases where the GP or family have not notified the HSE.<\/p><p>  The policy on random reviews arises from a recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his most recent report:<blockquote>The HSE should conduct reviews of random samples of cardholders on an annual basis.

I will speak about the problems associated with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland.<\/p><p>  I am a clinical laboratory specialist, MD and PhD, founder and director of the first clinic for tick-borne diseases and medical director of Infectolab in Augsburg, Germany, which is registered as an official clinic at the Bavarian Medical Council.  I am the international expert for the chief medical officer's clinical advisory committee on Lyme disease in Australia, CACLD, and also a director of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society, ILADS, in the USA.  I speak to the committee as a clinical laboratory specialist working with patients in diagnosing and treating Lyme borreliosis and co-infections in over 20,000 cases in the past ten years.  More and more Irish patients attend me in the clinic to get the right diagnosis and treatment.  Also, some Irish doctors have contacted me in recent years to get support in the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland.<\/p><p>  Lyme borreliosis is a bacterial infection by a spirochaete named borrelia burgdorferi, which can move everywhere around the body and be the reason for many symptoms and syndromes.  It is named the \"Known Unknown\" by Lyme borreliosis specialists, a chameleon-like bacteria that is difficult to diagnose and difficult to treat.  Lyme borreliosis is the fastest growing vector-borne infection in the United States.  A total of 300,000 patients get infected in the US according to the newest Centre for Diseases Control, CDC, USA reports, which means tens times more Americans than previously reported.<\/p><p>  Up to 50% of the ticks in Lyme-endemic areas are infected with borrelia.  The problem begins with the fact that just fewer than 50% of patients with Lyme borreliosis recall a tick bite.  Fewer than 50% of patients with Lyme borreliosis recall any bull's-eye rash - erythema migrans - as a typical sign for a fresh infection.  Without the recall of a tick bite or a bull's-eye rash, chronic Lyme borreliosis symptoms can be misdiagnosed as chronic fatique syndrome, CFS, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, depressions, autism and so forth.  In Ireland and all other countries worldwide, doctors are forced to use the borrelia-ELISA for borrelia antibodies as a screening test and not the borrelia Western Blot, even though the Western Blot has a higher test sensitivity, which means fewer false-negative results, and a higher specificity, which means fewer false-positive results.<\/p><p>  The common ELISA test, which one receives at the doctor's office, misses 35% to 60% of culture proven Lyme borreliosis.  The Western Blot finds about 60% of chronic infected patients, which means a lot of false-negative Western Blot results in the case of chronic Lyme borreliosis.  The laboratory tests for borrelia antibodies are not standardised and cannot exclude chronic Lyme borreliosis.  It is impossible.  Therefore, the European Union has spent &euro;1.1 million on the development of a highly sensitive and specific low-cost lab-on-a-chip system for Lyme diagnosis in the last two years by the Hilysens project.  My clinic, the BCA clinic in Augsburg, was one of the scientific partners in the Hilysens project.<\/p><p>  Lyme borreliosis is a clinical decision depending on Lyme-typical symptoms and differential diagnosis.  The average patient sees five doctors over nearly two years before being diagnosed with the correct diagnosis, Lyme borreliosis.  In Ireland and many countries, doctors are forced to treat a chronic Lyme patient for a restricted time with antibiotics.  The allowed maximum is four weeks in general, so only four weeks are allowed to treat a patient with chronic Lyme disease.  If the patient is not cured within four weeks, the definition of a \"post-Lyme disease syndrome\", PLDS, is given and most patients are treated symptomatically, but the persistent infection is not treated.  Many of these patients develop psychiatric disorders.  Short treatment courses with antibiotics have resulted in a 40% relapse rate, especially if the treatment beginning is delayed.  There has never been a study demonstrating that 30 days of antibiotic treatment cures chronic Lyme borreliosis.  Documentation is available which demonstrates that short courses of antibiotic treatment fail to eradicate borrelia burgdorferi.  A total of 40% of Lyme patients end up with long-term health problems.<\/p><p>  It is important to know and learn about each symptom which can be caused by borrelia burgdorferi to make the right clinical diagnosis in time to start the antibiotic treatment as soon as possible.  The patient should be monitored by the doctor after the treatment of any fresh infection, but especially during and after the treatment of a chronic infection.  The socio-economic costs for Ireland regarding misdiagnosed or too late diagnosed patients can be exorbitantly high, in addition to the costs for symptomatic therapies by painkillers or immune-suppressive remedies such as corticosteroids and all of their side effects for patients.  The earlier one treats a Lyme borreliosis patient, the better is the prognosis in general.<\/p><p>  My conclusions and proposals are as follows: first, teaching medical students at universities about all Lyme borreliosis symptoms by a standardised anamnesis, which means symptomatology,  and teaching them about problems with diagnostic tests and about treatment options, including the long-term treatment aspects; second, a basic course for general practitioners, GPs, about the handling of tick bites, symptomatology by a standardised anamnesis - a patient's account of their medical history, problems with diagnostic tests and treatment options for a patient by long-term treatment including the monitoring of the patient; third, initiation for studies about bacteria in the ticks or tick tests, improvement of diagnostic tests and long-term treatment and the development of new antibiotics against borrelia burgdorferi; and fourth, information campaigns for the Irish population on how to prevent tick bites and about symptoms in fresh and chronic infections.  The first step in that regard was taken by Jenny O'Dea, who is one of the first people I got to know here in Ireland.  She published a fantastic booklet for children and their parents to inform them about the risks and possibilities of Lyme disease.<\/p><p>  I offer the committee my full support and will be delighted to answer any questions the members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Armin Schwarzbach"},{"type":"speech","time":1385026500,"counter":909,"content":"<p>Thank you, Dr. Schwarzbach.

I will try to be as brief as possible and avoid the areas he has already covered.<\/p><p>  Lyme borreliosis is an ancient condition.  It affects humans in temperate parts of Europe and the United States.  Although it is ancient, the disease was only discovered and described as recently as 1982.  The first cases here were described in the mid-1980s and it is now accepted that the disease is endemic here.  Cases are not due to somebody having contracted the disease abroad.  A few might be, but the majority of cases are contracted here.<\/p><p>  The disease is transmitted by the tick,<i> Ixodes ricinus<\/i>, in this country.  It is commonly called the common tick, deer tick, sheep tick and in the west of Ireland it is referred to as an sciort&aacute;n.  It is the same beast.  To call something a tick bite is probably a misnomer because the tick remains attached to the victim for several days while it sucks blood.  There is no evidence that borreliosis can be transmitted by the bite of a flea, horsefly, mosquito, midge or anything other than a tick.  Lack of awareness of the risk of tick bite and of the symptoms of the disease on the part of the public and of general practitioners is the main impediment to both the prevention of the disease and its treatment.<\/p><p>  As Dr. Schwarzbach mentioned, the textbook first clinical sign of the disease is the bull's-eye rash, called the erythema migrans, which appears at the site of the tick bite.  However, it only appears in approximately 70% of cases of people who proceed to develop full-blown Lyme disease.  As a critical symptom, it might not appear at all, so treatment may not be instigated.  As the disease progresses, the nervous system in particular may be attacked, but there might also be joint and arthritic involvement as well as cardiac complications.  As a result, disease symptoms can vary from person to person.<\/p> <p>This can be confusing for patients who may share experiences and general practitioners, GPs, who find it causes problems for diagnosis.<\/p><p> There is an increasing risk of contracting Lyme disease in Ireland.  The risk is strongly correlated with the density of ticks in a particular area.  Persistence of the tick species transmitting Lyme disease in a particular area requires the presence of a sufficient number of large host animals on which the adult ticks can feed and obtain blood meals prior to producing a new generation of parasites.  The animals involved are usually cattle, sheep, goat or deer.  In Ireland up to 30 years ago, the particular tick species responsible for Lyme disease was, in relative terms, sparsely distributed.  They would have been known by livestock farmers in particular parts of the country as transmitters of a few diseases such as Redwater fever and Louping-ill virus to domestic farm animals.  The majority of urban dwellers would never have heard of a tick, let alone seen one.<\/p><p> Significant changes in the landscape have since occurred.  Re-afforestation and the development of recreational forest parks have provided ideal habitats for expansion of the population size and distributional area of both the native red deer and the introduced sika deer.  Escapees from fenced areas and parks, along with their reproduction in the wild, mean that deer are now widespread across much of rural Ireland.  For example, between 1978 and 2008, the distributional area occupied by red deer has shown an overall increase of over 560%.<\/p><p> The behaviour patterns of deer together with their short fur result in them being able to feed far greater numbers of ticks than, say, sheep.  As a consequence, we are seeing significant growth in tick numbers in areas where deer are common.  In some places, tick numbers are as high as any on continental Europe.  Greater use by humans of recreational forest parks and growth in outdoor activities such as hill-walking are resulting in increasing contact between humans and ticks.  This increased contact inevitably increases the risk of tick bite and, therefore, the risk of contracting Lyme disease.<\/p><p> A lack of public and medical practitioner awareness of the disease means that a patient presenting with it is often initially overlooked or misdiagnosed.  The delay is critical.  The longer the delay, the worse the outcome.  Most patients will have progressed to late-stage Lyme disease by the time they are treated.  Many late-stage patients fail to respond to conventional treatment and the disease can persist in a chronic state.<\/p><p> Improved treatment of Lyme disease in Ireland requires early diagnosis.  This demands an educational effort to make the public aware of the risk and potential consequences of tick bites and how to reduce this risk, as well as ensuring medical practitioners have the knowledge and competencies to detect, test for and treat the disease.<\/p><p> As things stand, deer numbers will continue to increase and will, therefore, serve to further amplify the growth in tick numbers.  Climate change and farming practices are together creating more favourable conditions for tick survival.  Increasing contact between ticks and humans will inevitably result in a rise in the incidence of Lyme disease.  It is not possible to significantly reduce either the deer population or the tick population by human effort.  In the absence of this, an educational approach will be the cheapest and most effective strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100004#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Eoin Healy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385027100,"counter":912,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Healy for his presentation.

However, Lyme disease is not regarded as a significant economic tick-borne disease in farm animals.<\/p><p>  Ticks are not distributed uniformly in Ireland, and even in regions where they occur in large numbers, they have particular habitat requirements.  They need shelter from the elements and a moist microclimate which they find in under-grazed farmland and in rough vegetation such as rushes, bracken, and heather.  Ticks have some fairly precise environmental requirements, especially when they leave the relative shelter of the base of the vegetation to find a new host.  They find a new host by questing, where they climb to the tips of the vegetation and grab onto an animal or person going by.  They need mild and moist conditions for questing, which are provided in late spring and in autumn in a typical Irish year.  This results in clearly defined spring and autumn peaks in tick-borne diseases.  On some farms the ticks have become adapted to one or the other season, while on other farms both peaks are seen.  Understanding the type of habitats that ticks favour and the annual peaks of tick activity in spring and autumn is one part of preventing Lyme disease.  We know when and where the highest risk of exposure will occur, along with the sub-populations of animals and humans most at risk.<\/p><p>  Lyme disease is strongly associated with deer in the USA, whereas in Ireland, research has suggested field mice and some ground-feeding bird species are more important as reservoir hosts.  In humans, we know Lyme disease causes a fever and a characteristic skin rash.  This can progress to cause central nervous system disease, arthritis and blood vessel damage in humans.  In animals, the same is true and the reported cases in the scientific literature worldwide have shown the main clinical signs associated with Lyme disease in animals consist of skin, neurological and arthritic syndromes, with some involvement of muscle.<\/p><p>  Research in other countries indicates that this organism is capable of causing sporadic disease in dogs, cattle and horses.  No confirmed cases have been reported from Irish animals to my knowledge.  However, it is likely there have been occasional undetected cases in animals here, given how common the organism and the vectors are and how commonly animals are bitten by ticks.<\/p><p>  There is some evidence that dogs are at higher risk of Lyme disease than other animals.  However, this may reflect the amount of time they spend in tick habitats, the number of tick bites they get, and the close attention they receive if they get sick.  As they are more likely to be exposed and affected, they are more likely to be detected.<\/p><p>  There are many gaps in our knowledge of Lyme disease in Irish animals that need further research in terms of the impact of the organism and the prevalence of Lyme disease in Ireland.  This year marks 21 years since barriers to trade in live animals between EU member states were lifted in 1992.  It would be timely to survey our tick population to check for the incursion of exotic tick species and to re-survey ticks for the agent of Lyme disease to monitor its distribution.<\/p><p>  Having said that, plenty of scientific evidence points towards widespread exposure to borrelia in Ireland.  Blood-testing of farmers in Northern Ireland has revealed evidence of widespread occupational exposure to borrelia.  This is likely to equally apply to other occupational and leisure users of marginal land and forestry.  Surveys that captured and tested Irish ticks have shown that many are carrying borrelia.<\/p><p>  Tick-borne diseases of Irish animals occur in well-defined areas and habitats.  Within these areas, relatively little tick-borne disease is seen in animals despite apparently heavy exposure to a variety of tick-borne pathogens.  This is because the exposure to ticks tends to occur from shortly after birth when the young animal may be protected by maternal immunity passed on in colostrum, the first milk.<\/p><p>  Other factors that impact on whether an animal is infected by a tick-borne disease include the phenomenon of co-infection.  If a tick is carrying a pathogen, as well as an immunosuppressive disease like tick-borne fever for example, then the chances of that pathogen causing disease are increased.  Many of the animal tick-borne diseases depend of these cold infections with tick-borne fever to cause the pathogen to multiply.<\/p> <p>Prevention of tick-borne diseases in animals consists of preventing and reducing the risk of tick bites.  Preventive treatment of animals against ticks is commonly employed in high risk areas to kill ticks or to prevent the organism from multiplying in the animals.  These measures are probably controlling tick numbers on animals and may be preventing us from seeing more Lyme disease in Irish animals, but Lyme disease is not the reason for applying these treatments.  Rather, it is for other tick-borne diseases such as Redwater and Louping-ill and other such diseases.<\/p><p> Treatment is reported in literature to be straightforward, with antibiotic treatment in the acute phase.  The important thing is awareness from an animal point of view and ensuring veterinary practitioners are aware of the possibility of Lyme disease as a differential diagnosis when dealing with an animal showing suggestive clinical signs.  This is an area where information campaigns and continuing education can increase the awareness and responsiveness of veterinary practitioners to possible cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. M&iacute;che&aacute;l Casey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385027700,"counter":915,"content":"<p>Our next speaker is Ms Lisa Vandergrift Davala, who has done extensive research on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100006#F00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385027700,"counter":916,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this invitation.  During the past two and a half years, I have had a chance to do extensive research in preparation for a documentary on Lyme disease.  Some 23 years ago, I contracted the disease and it took 20 years for the diagnosis.  We have arrived at an interesting moment in time as regards Lyme disease and tick-borne illnesses in Ireland.  Thanks to the joint efforts of patient advocates and this committee, we have seen Lyme disease made a notifiable disease in 2011.  Many Irish doctors are now willing to acknowledge the disease, to speak openly about their limited knowledge, to ask questions, to ask for information and educational resources and to suggest that patients give presentations to medical personnel.  Lyme disease has been the subject of two Seanad debates, in 2009 and 2012, acknowledging not only the burgeoning problem, but arguing that if resources did not yet exist in Ireland for patients to be diagnosed and treated, they must be given the support to seek help abroad.  Ms Jenny O&rsquo;Dea, who must be credited, co-founded Tick Talk Ireland and its excellent resource <i>ticktalkireland.org<\/i>.  Individual Lyme patients, through enormously supportive friendships, create the largest resource of all, by offering telephone and Skype support to each other during the harrowing effects of the disease and referrals to foreign testing and clinics.  A virtual underground railway has criss-crossed Ireland and most parts of the world.  We now have the beginning of recognition, of awareness, and of a willingness to have dialogue and to collaborate for progress.<\/p><p>  Equally, we must acknowledge the difficulty that foreign-tested, sero-positive and clinically diagnosed Lyme patients are having in ensuring their diagnoses by world-leading experts will be upheld when they return home to Ireland.  Difficulties also arise in having their disability status recognised or in being listed as having a notifiable disease, which needs to be considered when assessing the validity of those figures. <\/p><p>  Today, our focus must be to move forward and to contribute to resolving these medical conditions, which can only be denied at great cost to our nation&rsquo;s health, to the health of our agricultural industries and to Ireland&rsquo;s financial condition overall.  Last month, Britain&rsquo;s Lady Mary Mar asked attendees of the London Lyme conference what was the cost to the taxpayer of welfare benefits, social care, NHS provision and loss of income tax of maintaining these men, women and children in a state of health that precludes them from working and being active members of society.  Recent ESRI studies reveal skyrocketing numbers of children from birth to 19 years of age being diagnosed with MS in Ireland, with as much as 191% increase in a year, while experts, researchers and clinicians around the world have credited the very clear evidence that what we may have assumed were neurological or neurodegenerative diseases are actually patients who test positive for Lyme borrelia, which can resolve with appropriate treatment.<\/p><p>  A pathologist, Dr. Alan B. McDonald, has shown that seven out of the ten brain samples taken from diseased Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients after death were tested from the Harvard Brain Bank and were positive for Lyme DNA.  Dr. Dieter Klinghardt revealed that 100% of his neurodegenerative patients have tested positive for Lyme and progress with treatment occurs.  Mr. Michael J. Fox, the actor famously diagnosed at a very young age with Parkinson&rsquo;s, has now been found to have Lyme.  A study by neurologists at University College Hospital Galway found that the Republic of Ireland has one of the highest rates of Lyme disease in Europe.  According to the World Health Organization, Lyme disease is the world's fastest-spreading infectious disease but we cannot begin to discuss the numbers of infected people in Ireland without broaching the issue of accurate testing and availability of treatment.<\/p><p>  We have all been called here today to make a contribution to progress the awareness and treatment of Lyme and tick-borne diseases in Ireland.  The Oireachtas is the forum in which to ask bold questions and suggest even bolder solutions.  In the spirit of nothing ventured, nothing gained, I ask whether we have an epidemic of neurodegenerative diseases in Ireland or whether it is the ever-growing numbers of tick and vector-borne infections, which have progressed without prior detection and treatment in a country whose natural environment is a perfect habitat for these diseases and where the levels of infected ticks is well documented.<\/p><p>  In view of the research and clinical evidence from around the world pointing to the relationship between neurodegenerative diseases and the presence of borreliosis, can Ireland justify financially the expense of what may be needless disability?  Would we be willing, with the help of fellow European experts and highly sensitive testing, to test a sample portion of Irish sufferers diagnosed with MS, ALS, Parkinson&rsquo;s, Alzheimer&rsquo;s, motor neuron, etc., or to test an anonymous cross-section including these patients?  What if this small effort yielded a resoundingly positive correlation that could lead to a progressive way forward?  Most importantly, after today, if committee members or their family members were now diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease, would they not be consulting one of the overseas Lyme literate medical doctors and having their blood accurately tested before accepting a sentence to a wheelchair and a diagnosis, often made without the benefit of any laboratory testing, of having an incurable disease?  If we even thought we could help such patients, what would stop us?  Why not ensure a future that is not burdened with an ever-growing number of misdiagnosed, neurologically crippled patients who have no choice but to depend on a collapsing social welfare and health system?  It makes humane sense and it could also make financial sense.<\/p><p>  Our Irish doctors just want to heal people but they need to be trained in this disease and they must be told the truth that Lyme disease is in Ireland and that our only testing method, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA, which was developed to test for HIV originally, is a seriously flawed remnant from tainted guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and the Infectious Disease Society of America, IDSA, on the testing and treatment of Lyme disease that has now been publicly exposed as such through the investigations of Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal in 2008.  It is hoped that upcoming Washington hearings may finally lead to the prosecution of several individuals instrumental in the drafting.  Ireland need not have any obligation to use this misleading test, especially as we have excellent testing available now in Europe and the US and very exciting new testing on the near horizon in Europe, which will cost less than our current ELISA to administer and has an almost 100% sensitivity and specificity. <\/p><p>  None of the Irish doctors I have spoken to had known that the ELISA test&rsquo;s own manufacturer&rsquo;s paper insert, which stays in the lab and is never seen by doctors, states clearly that this test cannot disprove Lyme disease and that a clinical diagnosis must outweigh a negative ELISA.  However, it has been the failure to score on the test that has shut Irish Lyme patients out of treatment and forced them abroad.  Doctors need to be shown that paper insert as legions of Irish patients' futures depend upon it.  Furthermore, it is impossible for late stage Lyme patients to test positive on the ELISA, as we are too immune suppressed.  Today, very fortunately, we are honoured to have with us, one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts on Lyme disease, Dr. Armin Schwarzbach, who is generous with his information.<\/p><p>  It took 20 years to get my diagnosis and treatment.  By that time, I was unable to walk, I had Bell&rsquo;s palsy on one side of my face, I had nearly lost my life and almost all of what was in it.  I experienced symptoms of dementia and full paralysis.  That person, from two and a half years ago, could not have made this presentation.  I chose to know the truth rather than to be mothballed in a wheelchair with a neurodegenerative diagnosis and to suffer the horrors of my own body being eaten alive by bacteria until my demise. <\/p> <p>My greatest wish and the dream I have for Ireland is that we will now give that choice to all who need it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lisa Vandergrift Davala","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385028300,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Vandegrift Davala for her very moving testimony .

I am a Lyme disease patient from Limerick.  I am here to offer my own patient experience and also to give the committee a perspective on behalf of a number of patients who are experiencing difficulties in the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in Ireland.  Lyme disease is like the escape artist of diseases.  It is very difficult to find, even in blood tests.  Lyme disease is complicated for doctors to diagnose and is often misdiagnosed and under-diagnosed.  For patients, it is a painful and debilitating disease and it also presents a serious public safety issue in Ireland.  Lyme disease has more than 100 varied symptoms, including muscle and joint pain, back pain, headaches, muscle twitches, breathing difficulties and heart problems, and can at times result in paralysis and loss of sight.  For patients, the disease can feel like an intense mixture of a bad 'flu, severe arthritis and exhaustion but what differs is that symptoms can last for months or years.  In some cases, children are born with the disease.  The longer it is left untreated, the more damage Lyme disease can do.<\/p><p>  I would like to begin by giving the committee my personal experience of Lyme disease.  In July 2012 I got a tiny tick bite.  While I would like to be able to tell the committee this happened in a far off tropical location, it did not.  It happened to me at home in Pallasgreen, County Limerick.  I found the tick attached and removed it carefully but within three weeks I started to experience what I now know are typical acute Lyme disease symptoms.  I went to my general practitioner and had a range of tests carried out in Ireland, which all came back negative.  Looking back, one could say I was lucky that I found the tick bite and I was able to connect it to the fact that I became ill quite quickly.  I also knew of the dangers of tick bites.  Although I had a strong suspicion what was going on, Lyme disease was repeatedly ruled out by doctors.  In February 2013, I had specialist testing carried out in Germany, which confirmed that I had Lyme disease plus two co-infections.  <\/p><p>  In some ways, my story is an example of how complicated and fast acting the Lyme disease bacteria can be.  Before the tick bite, I was a keen amateur runner.  I was a voluntary coaching assistant with two athletics clubs in Limerick where I encouraged others to take up leisure running as a way to improve their health and well-being.  A month before the tick bite, I had won four medals at the Limerick county track and field championships, which to me was as good as, if not better than, winning Olympic gold.  I used to run approximately 20 to 25 miles a week and led an active, healthy lifestyle.  Within three weeks of the tick bite, I could not run at all and I have not been able to return to running since but, in many ways, that is the least of my worries.<\/p><p>  Apart from dealing with the disease itself, patients often face real challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in Ireland.  There are a growing number of patients who have tested negative for Lyme disease in Ireland who have subsequently tested positive through a specialist doctor or laboratory, for example, in Germany, Switzerland, Belgium or the USA.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, patient experience shows that some Irish hospital-based consultants refuse to acknowledge a diagnosis from a specialist Lyme disease doctor or laboratory from another country.  Without the support and expertise of these consultants, the Irish medical system finds it difficult, if not impossible, to help patients to deal with the disease.  This affects patients in a number of ways.  They are denied a diagnosis for a debilitating condition.  They have to find the money to travel to other EU states or countries to access treatment and, ultimately, their lives are at risk.<\/p><p>  While it is important to note that some patients who happen to test positive in Ireland, thankfully, get treatment but medical approaches vary considerably.  In preparing for today's meeting, Ms Brennan and I initially contacted 25 Lyme disease patients experiencing difficulties in accessing treatment in Ireland.  This number has since grown to more than 100 people - men and women from a range of ages, including young children, and from almost every county.  Information and a range of patient profiles was included in the longer submission sent to the committee in advance of today's meeting.<\/p><p>  Apart from these personal impacts, Lyme disease is also a serious public safety issue in Ireland.  By denying a specialist diagnosis of Lyme disease, patients are often tested for a range of other conditions, involving further blood tests, scans and referrals to other hospital consultants, leading to huge costs for the HSE or else paid for privately by patients.  Furthermore, there is evidence that Lyme disease can be transmitted sexually, congenitally from mother to baby and through blood donations.  The Irish Health Protection Surveillance Centre's disease surveillance report of April 2013 is of note here.  It states: \"surveys of blood donors indicate significant levels of sero-positivity in certain parts of the country (particularly in the West of Ireland): this suggests that a figure of 50 Lyme Borreliosis cases countrywide per annum could be a considerable underestimate.\"<\/p><p>  As patients, we are concerned that there is dangerous lack of accountability and governance with regard to the comprehensive diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in Ireland.  There is an urgent need to increase levels of awareness among the general public on the dangers of tick bites.  Prevention and early intervention improves a patient's chance of recovery.<\/p><p>  What needs to happen next?  As patients and citizens, we recommend a number of positive steps, some of which can be developed in partnership with the HSE.  The issue of Lyme disease should be addressed by the HSE at its next meeting with the committee.  The committee should appoint a rapporteur to carry out a detailed examination and report on the situation in regard to Lyme disease in Ireland and for patient representatives to be consulted as part of this process.  Patients feel there is a need for the HSE to establish a Lyme disease task group.  This group should include a range of expertise, including infectious diseases consultants, GPs, international Lyme disease experts and patient representatives.  It should also consult a number of other experts relating to patient symptoms, including chronic pain specialists, neurologists, rheumatologists, paediatricians, obstetricians, etc.  As patients, we are aware that Lyme disease is a very complicated illness.  We can understand that for doctors at all levels it also presents challenging and confusing scenarios where patients can present with a multitude of symptoms, in a variety of places, over a long period of time.<\/p><p>  We, as patients, feel the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in Ireland needs to be more patient-centred and more evidence-based.  Ireland has a real opportunity to work with up-to-date international best practice to improve this situation for patients aid the public.  Lyme disease is very much an orphan illness.  It is a minority illness and is not socially understood.  Patients with complex cases of the disease know that if they want to return to health, they must rely on international expertise.  While it could be said that Lyme disease is not overly prevalent in Ireland currently, due to increased travel by the population, this situation may change in the future and, from patient experience, we are also seeing more cases being contracted at home.  Furthermore, because so many patients are misdiagnosed with other illnesses, it is also impossible to say how many actual Lyme disease patients there are.  We do understand it is a relatively new disease within the Irish medical system and, as patients, we are encouraged by the leadership shown by joint committee in discussing this issue today.  We hope this issue will form part of further dialogue with the committee, the HSE and the Department of Health and are keen to be part of that positive development.  Again, we thank the committee for the opportunity to be here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100007#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Annette Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1385028300,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Moloney for her very sobering and challenge presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100007#G00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385028300,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I am very grateful that the committee has taken on board the seriousness of Lyme disease in Ireland and that I have the opportunity to make this presentation to it.  I am 39 years old and I live in Dublin with my husband and our three small children.  In August 2011, three weeks after my youngest daughter was born, I developed an ear infection.  Over the next six weeks, I had three such infections.  I was extremely weak and had a dreadful feeling I would just collapse.  Over the next 12 months, the weakness continued and I suffered daily from a multitude of symptoms.  The complete list of symptoms is simply too long to read out and the most important ones are included in my longer submission document.<\/p><p>  The worst symptoms were: burning pain in all of my muscles, where climbing stairs was near impossible; pain in all of my joints and, in particular, sacral joint pain which meant walking was often very painful; and relentless, excruciating inner and outer ear pain.<\/p> <p>For months I attended ear, nose and throat, ENT, clinics in Beaumont hospital on a weekly basis and was frequently at accident and emergency in the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital.  I saw more than nine different ENT doctors.  Steroid ointment was being put in, then taken out and put back in.  Sometimes I got relief and other times it was all pointless.  I was referred to a pain management specialist who prescribed nerve pain medication which did not help.  It was endless pain for months and I was so frustrated that we could not get to the bottom of the problem.  My ENT consultant was so baffled as to why I was not responding to treatment that he arranged for a second opinion for me.  I also had regular chest infections, bouts of 'flu, episodes of streptococcal throat and kidney infections.  I was constantly at my GP's practice or at the VHI SwiftCare clinics late at night needing antibiotics for the latest dose that came at me.<\/p><p> Managing the aforementioned symptoms and ongoing physical weakness on a daily basis was an enormous challenge.  Imagine trying to hold and feed a newborn infant while battling a feeling that your legs were about to give from under you, with two other small children, aged four and two, at your feet.  As a family we required enormous levels of help from grandparents in order to function.  The number of hospitals and clinics I had to attend was starting to increase.  These appointments were starting to exhaust me physically and mentally and left me wondering who could I turn to.  In total, I attended 11 hospitals and clinics in Ireland as a public and private patient, some on a very regular basis, looking for answers.  My medical bills in Ireland started to eat in to our savings but we had no answers to show for the money we were spending.  <\/p><p> In the summer of 2012, I was very lucky to be seen by an Irish GP who had spent 30 years working in the US and he recognised the symptoms of Lyme disease.  He referred me for an appointment with an infectious diseases consultant in Ireland who sent my blood to the UK.  The results from an ELISA test were negative and I was told I did not have Lyme disease and to go back to my GP.   With the support of the GP I learned of the Borreliose Centrum in Augsburg, BCA, Germany.  I had spent five years living in Frankfurt in my 20s and I felt very comfortable travelling to Germany for treatment as I am very familiar with the quality of their medical work and their approach to patients.  My blood tests for Lyme disease through BCA returned positive results.  It was such a breakthrough for my whole family that at last we knew why I was so unwell and why I was in so much pain.  There was immense hope for my future.<\/p><p> I then travelled to Augsburg in Germany.  For two hours a German Lyme disease specialist talked to me about all of my symptoms from my ears down to my toes.  We discussed all of my possible exposure to ticks.  Although we will never know when I was infected, it is highly likely it was when I was living in Montauk on Long Island in the US on a Jl student visa, as I lived in a wooden chalet surrounded by deer.  We were shown ticks and told to be careful.  Unfortunately, I never developed the classic bull's eye rash.  The borrelia bacteria that causes Lyme disease can lie dormant in a patient's body for months or years and only become active when the patient has become immune suppressed.  For me, the immune system suppression of pregnancy gave the dormant borrelia a chance to take over.<\/p><p> I started my treatment in October 2012 with two weeks in Germany having intravenous antibiotics.  Thereafter, I had 16 weeks of intravenous antibiotic treatment with a VHI Homecare team who looked after me so well in my own home.  I never thought I would ever have to call on such a service but I did.  I am so thankful it was available to me as it was excellent and played a pivotal role in my recovery.  Treatment brought such relief.  Within weeks my ear pain lifted and this gave me a glimpse of what life could be like.  The neurological symptoms<b><\/b>like noise and smell sensitivities also quickly disappeared.  So that members can really understand the difference this treatment has made to my life, I will draw comparisons between October last year and this year.  Last year, I needed a carer with me and a wheelchair for the walk through Dublin Airport for my flight to Germany.  This October I flew to Gatwick by myself for a conference.  My life is now filling up with social events that simply were not possible for me before treatment.  <\/p><p> My treatment for Lyme disease through BCA has restored my health and my life, which had been completely shattered for almost two years by this awful debilitating disease.  The money spent has been the best money I or my family have ever spent.  One of the best moments on this journey was going to see my ENT consultant.  I handed him my German results and he fell back in to his chair.  &quot;Lyme disease, I had never even thought of it&quot;, he exclaimed.  He was delighted for me as we now had the answer to the ear pain.  He congratulated me on persisting and getting to the bottom of my ill health, but most importantly for getting to the bottom of it all in only one year.  His own brother, a doctor in the US, had also had Lyme disease, but it took him two years to get his diagnosis.<\/p><p> I am now in contact with over 20 Irish people who are travelling to Germany for treatment, some of whom have had a much worse experience than me.  The system here is delivering for some but not for others.  That is why I ask that this committee continues its engagement with us, as patients, in order to improve the lives of those who struggle with this relatively new and complicated disease.  As Annette mentioned, engaging with the HSE would be an excellent start.  A rapporteur to look at Lyme disease across the country, taking into account increased travel over the last number cf years, and a Lyme disease task group in Ireland could mean fewer people having to endure the experience I had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100007#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Tracy Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1385028900,"counter":923,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Brennan and now call Deputy Kelleher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100008#H00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1385028900,"counter":924,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their submissions and particularly for sharing their personal experiences with us.

It was very interesting for me, as a doctor, to hear the presentation.  I feel I have had a CME exercise in infectious disease today.

My understanding is that the thrust of the argument is pointing in the direction that there are people who have the somewhat controversial chronic Lyme disease.  The first, fourth, fifth and sixth witnesses would be advocates for the position that there is chronic Lyme disease which requires long-term antibiotic therapy which is not given in Ireland and which necessitates people travelling.  It must be stated for the sake of balance that this is not a uniquely Irish phenomenon.  It is not because Irish doctors are uncaring but because there is about 95% international consensus that the entity is not well-substantiated and leading bodies, including the Infectious Disease Society of America, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Institutes of Health, have denied the evidence in favour of a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease infection.  In a major <i>New England Journal of Medicine<\/i> review article in 2007, there was substantial criticism of Blumenthal as having been intimidatory.  Individual researchers that have adopted the position that chronic Lyme disease is not yet validated have been personally threatened.  It is important we understand there are two sides to the argument and the position on whether chronic Lyme disease exists.  I would like specifically to get the opinions of Dr. Healy and Mr. Casey on whether they think the ELISA is not a valid test, and I would like to get Dr. Schwarzbach's information on the alternative blood test he is using.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100009#J00200","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1385029500,"counter":933,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the very good presentations.

We could spend two or three hours discussing all the points that have been made.  I will focus on the key points.  A clinical diagnosis is needed in this case.  The diagnosis must be made on the basis of the symptoms, which is very difficult.  One needs to give time to the patient.  An hour or more is needed to ask him or her about his or her medical history.  One must then find a correlation with a possible tick bite or other differential diagnosis.  That means it is a speaking medicine.  This is not done in universities or hospitals because of a lack of time.  This is done by general practitioners or by ambulance personnel.  That is how it is done in Germany.<\/p><p>  The doctors trust the ELISA technique.  The HIV ELISA was founded in 1980.  The antigenicity of <i>borrelia burgdorferi<\/i> is so complicated that it was a big problem to develop a good ELISA that is sufficiently sensitive.  There are several working groups in this area.  The EU knows about the problem.  That is why &euro;1.1 million was provided to improve the sensitivity of the test.  We developed new antigens as part of this new test system.  More subspecies have been found.  Borrelia is not one bacteria.  It consists of several subspecies.  <i>Borrelia miyamotoi<\/i> is a brand new subspecies which has been detected in Russia and the USA.<\/p><p>  We have to look for several subspecies.  The ELISA technique is a very weak technique because one could just put some antigens on the ELISA particle.  The immunoblot technique is a better technique.  On the other hand, not all patients develop antibodies in the body.  The next problem can arise if the patient is treated at an early stage with doxycycline, which is normally used.  In such circumstances, no antibody production will start in the body, which makes it complicated to diagnose.  If a clinical diagnosis is required, one must do a good anamnesis and a good symptomatology, including the differential diagnosis.  One needs to give the patient time.  It is not possible to do all of this in ten minutes.<\/p><p>  University studies that were done in the 1980s and 1990s do not accept chronic Lyme disease because they do not see chronic Lyme disease.  If patients go to their GP, rather than a hospital, with symptoms like those of fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis, they will be sent to a neurologist for spinal fluid analysis.  If that test is negative for Lyme disease, it will be excluded from consideration.  Neurologists also use spinal fluid for a very weak ELISA technique to exclude this.  That is impossible.  It cannot be diagnosed by laboratory tests.  A clinical diagnosis is required.  This needs experience.  It cannot be done by a normal GP without any experience.<\/p><p>  The universities do not teach students about Lyme disease.  Like other doctors of my age, I did not hear anything about this when I was a student.  Lyme disease is a very young disease.  It started in 1981.  The oldest patient is a 5,000 year old iceman.  It has existed for a very long period.  There are two different tendencies in the medical world.  The first of them relates to those with chronic infections.  The second of them relates those in the acute or subacute stages, who tend to go to hospitals.  In the other cases, they tend to go to GPs.  We have to care more for those with chronic infections rather than those in the acute or subacute stages.  It would be good to do this.<\/p><p>  The therapies are definitely too short.  One cannot tell someone they have been healed of a bacteria after four weeks.  This is what we do not see in our patients' group.  If one treats a patient with doxycycline for two or three weeks, one has to monitor the patient.  One cannot leave the patient alone.  One has to keep an eye on what happens afterwards.  It can be a very traumatic disease.  The committee has heard some examples.  This is my daily work in the hospital and the laboratory.<\/p><p>  Ireland is not alone in having this problem.  There is a strong move in this direction in the Czech Republic, Poland and Finland, which I will visit soon.  Each of those countries plans to do something about this problem to help chronically infected patients who have received tick bites.  Not everybody sees the tick bite.  That is what it makes it complicated.  Not everybody has the typical symptoms.  Some 10% of patients have the summer flu, for example.  Nobody asks whether one has received a tick bite when one has the summer flu.  It is not a typical question for a GP.  One has to know about this.  One has to learn about it.<\/p><p>  This can be a life-threatening disease at the end.  Chronic Lyme disease is not a disease for the hospital.  It is a matter for rheumatologists and neurologists.  The psychiatric question is very important at the end.  If one spends one's whole life suffering from pain, if one uses many painkillers and immunosuppressive medicines and if there is an explosion of bacteria in one's body, one will feel hopeless, particularly if one loses one's place in the workforce.  We need to consider what happens in such circumstances from a psychiatric perspective.  It is typical for patients to be sent to a psychiatric specialist.  I have seen thousands of such cases - not just in Ireland - in recent years.  It is not an Irish problem.<\/p><p>  I was also asked about the definition of a post-Lyme disease symptom.  Most doctors postulate.  That is not an explanation for me because I do some special tests.  I have been asked about these tests.  They came from the tuberculosis world.  One such test is the lymphocyte transformation test, which is the gold standard for tuberculosis.  Many patients - I do not know the exact number - do not react on the antibodies used in the immunoblot or ELISA techniques.  They react on the T cells.  I think we have to look increasingly at the T cells in the coming years.  There is a tendency in the scientific world and in laboratories-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100010#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Armin Schwarzbach"},{"type":"speech","time":1385030100,"counter":942,"content":"<p>Is there an awareness and a willingness among Dr. Schwarzbach's profession to change its methodology?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100010#K00600","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385030100,"counter":943,"content":"<p>Yes.

I have seen such mapping.  One cannot always rely on it.  Those who live on the east coast and take their holidays in the west might develop symptoms when they return.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre states on its website that \"likely estimates suggest that there are between fifty and a hundred cases each year\".  The data I have seen from the Cork and Kerry region suggest that this number of cases is encountered in that region alone each year.  I have estimated, based on the population size for that region extrapolated for the country as a whole, that there are more than 250 cases in this country each year.<\/p> <p>If we come at it from a different angle, it is reckoned that there are 65,000 new cases of Lyme disease appearing in Europe every year.  Based on the population size in Europe of approximately 735 million and on a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis of 4.58 million, that would give us about 400 cases a year.  Dr. Armin Schwarzback might be able to comment on this but certainly American testers would reckon that they are possibly picking up something in the order of one in ten cases; in other words, they are missing nine cases for every one they pick up.  If we were to take a somewhat more conservative view and say we are catching, say, one in four and if we have 400 new cases per year, that means that there are 1,600 cases a year in the country.  If we accept that there is such a thing as chronic Lyme and that a certain percentage are not responding to treatment and that their disease condition persists over a number of years, we must think about the burden of illness that is building up over a period of, say, five or ten years and the cost to the families, the sufferers themselves and the whole health system.<\/p><p> As to whether we could do anything about reducing the number of ticks in the environment or ticks on deer, it is an impossible situation.  There are deer everywhere.  I am not recommending a deer cull or anything like that but it is just that the situation with deer is out of control.  To wipe out ticks on one acre of land would almost be impossible.

A wide number of points have been raised.  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked if the symptoms were similar to those of humans.  The clinical signs described for animals are very similar to what is described as acute Lyme disease.  To take up the point raised by Deputy Dan Neville, acute Lyme disease is not a controversial diagnosis.  It is a well established condition.  The controversy is probably over what Senator John Crown identified as the ELISA negative chronic Lyme disease.  That is a controversial area.  That is not my area of expertise.  I am open certainly to testimony of the type we have heard here today.  There are other pieces of what one could call circumstantial evidence that could support it.  It has been shown in peer review publications that the organism can persist for years in the brains of mice.  In all of this we need to work towards a case definition, which would combine clinical science, test findings and pathology.  To that extent, that package has not been put together so far as I have read.  Certainly, in animals there is no suggestion of a syndrome of chronic Lyme disease but, I think, in animals we are missing acute Lyme disease.  I think many cases are being missed.  The points made by Dr. Eoin Healy are absolutely correct that there is much under-diagnosis of Lyme disease in both animals and in humans.<\/p><p>  On the research front, there is a huge gap in our knowledge.  Some of the work done on the distribution of ticks and on mapping probably needs to replicated.  Dr. Annetta Zintl and Dr. Theo de Waal<b><\/b>in UCD are interested in doing further research on the distribution of ticks.  If we progress that on to ticks that are collected as part of that survey could be tested for some of the organisms that cause some of these tick bird diseases, including borrelia, it would add significantly to our knowledge.<\/p><p>  On the ELISA test, it seems to be uncontroversial from an animal point of view that it would do well in acute infections.  The controversy is over whether, in untreated infections when the antibody response drops and the ELISA is no longer detecting antibody, the organism is still present and still causing disease.  Again, we have to be mindful that 25 years ago stomach ulcers were not treated with antibiotics and a bacterial cause was not recognised.  An open mind is important.  I would think that scientifically the jury is still out in terms of peer review publication.  I am not contradicting what people have said here today but in terms of what is in the published literature, and it is not my area of expertise, certainly on the animal side we have not seen the chronic Lyme case proven.  One hears compelling testimony from people.  I think we have to keep an open mind on that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100011#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l Casey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385030700,"counter":956,"content":"<p>First of all we have to talk about the vilification of patients.  It is something that came up in one of the questions, the horror of being told by a physician or a consultant that one must be making it up.  Unfortunately, this is a scenario that happens too frequently.  I have been loth to talk too much about my personal situation but in view of the questions this morning, it is compelling that I say something.  Two and a half years ago I attended a top hospital in Dublin with the two top neurologists.  One turned to my husband and said, \"I think you ought to consider a psychiatric evaluation for your wife\".  I sat in the wheelchair, having failed numerous neurological tests, yet what we were being told to do was to go the psychiatric route.  What happens when a disease is vilified and is not given sanction?  If I told somebody I had Parkinson's disease or if I said that to friends, family and community, there would be a collective \"ah\" and support would be given immediately.  It is a disease and a name - warm and fuzzy - and lots of support is provided.  When one says one has Lyme disease, one can hear the crickets twitter and people look at one.  There is not the sense of \"we know what to do, we know you have a disease for which nothing can be done, so we will surround you and take care you and one should not worry about a thing\".<\/p><p>  Too often the situation for Lyme patients is that once they receive the diagnosis, and they have had to work very hard to do so, even their own families can reject.  It is such a horrifying situation to know that one's own Government's health system and most of the doctors in it do not recognise the thing for which one is now being treated successfully.  I would argue that whatever controversies there are with the idea of chronic Lyme disease or the diagnosis using the ELISA, we are three of thousands in this country with this disease.  Without the treatment we have received I doubt that any of us would be able to lift our heads up to a microphone this morning.  At least two of us have been in a wheelchair within recent years.  We would welcome evidence based and peer reviewed work on this and surely that will come, but we are the canaries in the coalmine.

We might only pick up on one out of every ten cases, but hopefully we are a bit better now and are picking up on one out of every four.  Some time ago I came to think that there are probably four different types of patients in Ireland connected to this area.  We have the Lyme disease patients who tested positive and who were, perhaps, able to access treatment, although that treatment could be varied and limited.  There are those of us who tested negative and who decided to pursue another option and to get an international diagnosis.  In my case, it was clear, as, luckily, I had found the tick bite and pursued another course of research.  There are also patients who tested negative and who did not get a second opinion.  They probably believed the ELISA test or the Western Blot test and think they are clear of Lyme disease.  There are also probably patients who have never been tested for this at all and who have no idea that their possible condition could be caused by it.<\/p><p>  On the option of second opinions and whether there is a facility to work with existing hospitals on this issue, unfortunately, patient experience is that this is not a good option.  We know of one patient who was told by an infectious disease consultant, despite the availability of hi-tech diagnostic information from Germany and with seven cases backing up the evidence, that he could try and seek a second opinion on it but that there were four or five people working in this area in Ireland and they were all agreed on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100012#M01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Annette Moloney"},{"type":"speech","time":1385031300,"counter":969,"content":"<p>Why is that the case?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2013112100012#M01300","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1385031300,"counter":970,"content":"<p>In my experience, some infectious disease consultants have a broad range of experience, but perhaps they do not have specialist experience in the area of Lyme disease.  They may not have had the positive experience other clinicians have had of seeing somebody come through a long treatment with a positive outcome.  There are complications around the fact that one of the long-term treatments for Lyme disease is long-term antibiotics.  Almost everything else in the health system tells us that the over-prescription of antibiotics is a big problem.  We then say that we have done our research and would like to request long-term antibiotic treatment, or in some cases IV antibiotic treatment, but this is blocked.<\/p><p>  There are also scenarios where when that knowledge and further referrals are not available, patients are told they will be referred to a rheumatologist for this other condition and that they should take a course of steroids in the meantime.  Giving steroids is like giving Red Bull to a patient with Lyme disease.  They will increase the level of the infection hidden in the person's connective tissues throughout the person's system.  In my case, I believe the fact I was fit and healthy in my early 40s meant the Lyme disease had a better chance of getting access to my connective tissues.  Looking back, this was unfortunate.  Also, due to the psychiatric aspect of the disease, some patients have been recommended anti-depressants.<\/p><p>  Some members have asked about the Western Blot test and the ELISA test.  I failed both of those tests here, but my tests came up positive in Germany.  There is a conundrum there in terms of international expertise.  Lyme disease is a notifiable disease, but neither of the two GPs I tried to work with here could notify my case of Lyme disease because it was based on an international diagnosis and was blocked by an Irish hospital-based consultant.  There is a great will on the part of GPs who see cases of Lyme disease on a regular basis.  We had a fantastic GP who was available to meet with us today, but he is in the same predicament in terms of lack of support.<\/p><p>  On insurance, I pay a significant amount in family health insurance per year, again because of my treatment being blocked by a hospital-based consultant.  I cannot get any support in that regard.  In terms of my status, I endured five and a half months of oral antibiotics during the summer.  Treatment for Lyme disease often makes symptoms worse.  Patients require ongoing ECG tests and liver analysis to ensure their systems can deal with the treatment.  I must now be retested in January, and based on my current symptoms, it is quite likely I will need longer term treatment, which could involve travelling to Germany for IV treatment.<\/p><p>  We are keen to look at the positives.
