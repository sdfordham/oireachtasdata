As the Deputy may be aware, unlike alcohol and tobacco, SSDs are not a controlled product under the EU general excises directive, and therefore cannot be stored in tax warehouses for release and tracking so that raises issues in itself.  Therefore, it will be crucial that effective compliance measures are incorporated in the design of the tax to support collection in a Single Market environment in which the free movement of products cannot be impeded and products cannot be made subject to cross-border or excise movement controls. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the UK announced the introduction of a soft drinks industry levy in March 2016, with an extensive period of industry and stakeholder consultation, before the levy is actually imposed from April 2018.\u00a0  Given the border that is shared between Ireland the UK, and the supermarket chains which operate and supply SSDs in both jurisdictions, it is important that we examine carefully how the UK tax will operate, and consider the effects\u00a0that\u00a0the design and timing of the introduction of\u00a0the UK tax may have on an\u00a0Irish tax on SSDs.<\/p>  <p>  At this point I\u00a0have confidence\u00a0that\u00a0a tax on SSDs can be\u00a0introduced from 2017.

As a result, Ireland currently applies the zero rate to a range of goods and services including most foods, children's clothes and shoes, and oral medicines.

They make up the vast majority of businesses in Ireland and account for approximately seven in every ten jobs.  Supporting the finance needs of these businesses is therefore a priority for this Government. <\/p>  <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was incorporated in September 2014 and its goal is to ensure access to flexible and lower cost funding for Irish SMEs.  The SBCI launched its first product programme in February 2015 and lending to SMEs commenced in early March 2015 through its initial on-lending partners, AIB and Bank of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Up to the end of December 2015, in its first nine months of operation, the SBCI lent some &euro;172 million to approximately 4600 SMEs.  The loans have been taken up by Irish SMEs for a variety of purposes and across a range of sectors in the economy.  84% of loans were for investment purposes and the average loan size is approximately &euro;37,000.  There is a wide geographical spread and the vast majority of loans are to regionally based SMEs outside Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  To further meet the financing needs of SMEs, the SBCI has expanded the number of on-lending partners through which its funds can be accessed.  The SBCI now has a total of six on-lending partners.  These are AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Merrion Fleet, Finance Ireland and First Citizen.<\/p>  <p>  The increased number of on-lenders is a key step in creating greater competition for SME lending in the Irish market, by supporting smaller indigenous providers of finance and providing funding for a broader range of products, including Asset Finance, Leasing and Contract Hire.  The SBCI is in advanced discussions with a number of other potential on-lenders.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that of the SBCI's initial funding capacity of &euro;800 million, &euro;791 million has now been committed to its on-lending partners to support the financing needs of SMEs.

The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.\u00a0 Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  When it was introduced initially the CCMA contained a six month (later extended to 12 months) moratorium for co-operating\u00a0borrowers whose mortgage\u00a0was in arrears (or pre-arrears).\u00a0 This was revised in\u00a02013 and replaced with a requirement that a lender is required to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose, before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.\u00a0 Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement or the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.\u00a0 This gives co-operating borrowers time to consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.<\/p>  <p>  The combined effect of these two protections (an eight month protection period and a requirement for three months' notice) is that, for a co-operating borrower, legal proceedings may not commence until three months from the date the letter (setting out one of the above positions) is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to also note that the commencement of the court process is not a signal that a repossession will occur.  It may often be the case that the process then prompts borrowers to re-engage with their bank and to find a solution.\u00a0 Often these cases are adjourned to allow both parties time to find a sustainable solution.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.\u00a0\u00a0The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory\u00a0avenue to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.\u00a0 If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.\u00a0 Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to,\u00a0insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.\u00a0 Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.<\/p>  <p>  The numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.\u00a0 Data released by the Central Bank on 10 June shows that to end-Q1 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last eleven quarters.\u00a0 Some 120,447 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.\u00a0 It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that borrower will be able to remain in their family home.\u00a0 Consequently, I would urge borrowers in this situation to contact the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) who are in a position to provide free and confidential support to borrowers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300065#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":86,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[17495\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300065#WRB02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he believes that the framework agreement between the State and the banks is fit for purpose, given the numbers of repossession cases and manner in which they have been handled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":87,"content":"<p>The Relationship Framework documents for AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB were specified and published\u00a0in March 2012,\u00a0while Permanent TSB's was also\u00a0amended on 23\u00a0April 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The framework documents, which generally formed part of the recapitalisation agreements, define the relationship between the Minister and the relevant institution.  These documents are drafted and structured to ensure that the institutions will operate on a commercial basis and independent of the Minister in respect of their day to day operations.  The role of the Minister is also set out and reflects his shareholding in the relevant institution and also the other support provided to that institution.<\/p>  <p>  As a result the Minister has\u00a0no statutory function in relation to the day to day\u00a0banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the\u00a0board and management of the relevant institution.<\/p>  <p>  However from a general policy perspective, the approach of the Government is to support people in genuine mortgage arrears and where feasible, to put in place a sustainable restructure to address and resolve such a difficulty.  This is clearly set out in the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears where it requires a lender in respect of a cooperating borrower to explore all of the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by that lender and that a lender must document its consideration of each option examined and the reasons why the options offered or not offered to the borrower are, or are not appropriate and sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  If a solution cannot be agreed between borrower and lender, or if it is agreed that a mortgage restructure is not a sustainable solution, there are alternative mechanisms available to allow a debtor remain in the house in appropriate cases.  For example, the Mortgage to Rent scheme is available in cases where the house and household would be appropriate and eligible for social housing.  Where the borrower and lender cannot agree on a sustainable mortgage restructure, the debtor has the option to formulate and propose a PIA to his\/her secured and other creditor(s).

The postponement arose from\u00a0one of the recommendations of the review.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the\u00a0remaining recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report to be considered in full. Local authorities receive income from a variety of sources including grants from Central Government, Local Property Tax allocations, commercial rates and other locally raised charges. <\/p>  <p>  Local Property Tax was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions and making the taxation system less dependent on other taxes. <\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than they received as General Purpose Grants from the Local Government Fund in 2014.

The postponement arose from\u00a0one of the recommendations of the review.<\/p>  <p>  The postponement also gives sufficient time for the\u00a0remaining recommendations in Dr Thornhill's report to be considered in full. Local authorities receive income from a variety of sources including grants from Central Government, Local Property Tax allocations, commercial rates and other locally raised charges.<\/p>  <p>  Local Property Tax was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions and making the taxation system less dependent on other taxes. <\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than they received as General Purpose Grants from the Local Government Fund in 2014.

The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment. In this regard solid fuels, which have been traditionally favoured by household consumers,\u00a0have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.\u00a0 As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important they are taxed.\u00a0 While the carbon tax was introduced for transport fuels in December 2009, its application to solid fuels was delayed to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply. Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011\u00a0and the\u00a0carbon tax was then applied to solid fuel on a phased basis in 2013 and 2014.Coupled with the long lead in period to the implementation of carbon tax on solid fuels generous grants have also been provided, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, via Better Energy Homes and also provides home energy upgrades free of charge to vulnerable households via Better Energy Warmer Homes to reduce dependence on combustion of fossil fuels for home heating.\u00a0 The Better Energy Homes Scheme has to date provided over &euro;190m in funding to over 185,000 homes resulting in a reduced energy demand. The carbon tax, as part of the overarching energy strategy, is a key tool to reduce emissions towards meeting our climate change commitments.\u00a0 Greenhouse gases are contributing to climate change and as a signatory to the UNCOP 21 Paris Agreement, Ireland has committed to play its part in reducing emissions.\u00a0 The carbon tax is deemed to be the most cost effective way of reducing overall emissions and therefore plays an important role\u00a0in providing incentives for emission reduction activities in this regard, and it is important the tax is levied\u00a0on all fossil fuels fairly to encourage behavioural changes.

As part of this review, a public consultations process was conducted in 2014 to which there was a significant response with substantive and wide-ranging views received about the law and practice in respect of judicial appointments.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, any new proposed legislation in this area will also be the subject of full consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny so there will be ample further opportunity for interested persons and groups to express their further views in relation to the matter. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently eight vacancies in the various courts and further vacancies will arise before the end of this year.  I am currently considering the best approach not only in relation to filling the existing vacancies but also in terms of bringing forward the reform legislation.  The Deputy will appreciate that while I cannot be definitive in respect of this issue today, I can say that the Government is likely to determine the approach to be taken on this matter in the coming weeks taking all of the relevant matters into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300067#WRD04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sex Offenders Restrictions","counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300067#WRD05000"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[17662\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300067#WRD05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the Sex Offenders Act 2001 empowers the authorities to place restrictions on sex offenders, who have committed sex assaults against children, living in proximity to or overlooking playgrounds; if there are guidelines on these issues for the attention of the relevant authorities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1243","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":197,"content":"<p>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides that all sex offenders, subject to the provisions of Part 2 of that Act, must notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of their name and address, and any subsequent change to those details, for a specified period of time following the relevant conviction.

While the report and recommendations from counsel were not provided to complainants, I had sought to ensure that letters to complainants informing them of the outcome of the review of their particular complaints should set out the recommendation of counsel and also outline, as far as possible, the reasons for that recommendation.

I accepted this recommendation and informed the complainant of my decision. Subsequently, in consultation with the Attorney General on this and the other cases where an inquiry was recommended, I decided that a statutory inquiry under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act would be a more effective instrument for such an inquiry.

The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.\u00a0 Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  When it was introduced initially the CCMA contained a six month (later extended to 12 months) moratorium for co-operating\u00a0borrowers whose mortgage\u00a0was in arrears (or pre-arrears).\u00a0 This was revised in\u00a02013 and replaced with a requirement that a lender is required to wait at least eight months from the date the arrears arose, before legal action can commence against a co-operating borrower.\u00a0 Separately, regardless of how long it takes the lender to assess a case, and provided that the borrower is co-operating, the lender must give three months' notice to the borrower before they can commence legal proceedings where the lender does not offer an alternative repayment arrangement or the borrower does not accept an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender.\u00a0 This gives co-operating borrowers time to consider other options such as a Personal Insolvency Arrangement. <\/p>  <p>  The combined effect of these two protections (an eight month protection period and a requirement for three months' notice) is that, for a co-operating borrower, legal proceedings may not commence until three months from the date the letter (setting out one of the above positions) is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to also note that the commencement of the court process is not a signal that a repossession will occur   it may often be the case that the process then prompts borrowers to re-engage with their bank and to find a solution.\u00a0 Often these cases are adjourned to allow both parties time to find a sustainable solution.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that in a repossession case before the Courts a borrower's rights are not confined to the provisions of the CCMA.\u00a0\u00a0 The 2013 Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act has provided a new statutory\u00a0avenue to borrowers in a repossession case involving a primary dwelling to seek an adjournment of the repossession case to allow the borrower the opportunity to consider and, if so decided, to propose a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) to creditors in order to resolve an unsustainable debt position.\u00a0 If this is approved by the Court, the debtor would then be in a position to formally propose an alternative and sustainable payment arrangement irrespective of whether or not the primary home lender considered or rejected such an arrangement under the CCMA.\u00a0 Also, under a PIA there is an onus on the personal insolvency practitioner to,\u00a0 insofar as is reasonably practicable, formulate a proposal on terms that will not require the debtor to dispose of an interest in, or cease to occupy, a private principal residence.\u00a0 Even if such a PIA proposal is rejected by creditors, the Personal Insolvency Act has now been amended to provide that the proposal can then be submitted to a Court for adjudication.<\/p>  <p>  The numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.\u00a0 Data released by the Central Bank on 10 June shows that to end-Q1 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last eleven quarters.\u00a0 Some 120,447 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.\u00a0 It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that borrower will be able to remain in their family home.\u00a0 Consequently, I would urge borrowers in this situation to contact the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) who are in a position to provide free and confidential support to borrowers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300069#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax Regime","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300069#WRF00550"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[17747\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300069#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider a higher rate of tax on excessive profits made by vulture funds, for example, where margins are greater than 50%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Weaker than expected trading partner growth would negatively impact on Irish growth through reduced exports.  Growth in Emerging Market Economies disappointed in 2015, and while Ireland's direct trade exposure remains relatively small, we would be exposed to a more generalised slowdown in the world economy.  The upcoming referendum on EU membership in the UK is another downside risk facing the Irish economy with Ireland potentially more exposed than most to a UK exit.  Figures published this month showed a deceleration in merchandise trade which may be indicative of a delayed spillover from the slowdown in global trade observed in 2015.

The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises.  The Act means that any purchasers of loans books are required either to become regulated themselves by the Central Bank or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans.<\/p>  <p>  The Act also ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  It also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit firm to perform such an action, thereby further enhancing the consumer's protections.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is now the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of credit servicing firms. Credit servicing firms must comply with all relevant requirements of financial services legislation, including the various codes mentioned already and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).<\/p>  <p>  In addition to compliance with Central Bank codes of conduct, credit servicing firms will have to demonstrate to the Central Bank that they have:<\/p>  <p>  -  Robust governance and adequate resources to ensure compliance;<\/p>  <p>  -  Agreements with loan owners that enable the credit servicing firm to fully comply with its obligations under Irish financial services legislation; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Adequate and effective control of loan servicing in the State to enable Central Bank oversight. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides protections for borrowers who endeavour to meet their commitments in relation to their mortgages and the 2015 Act ensures that these protections apply when a loan has been sold.<\/p>  <p>  The CCMA sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.

Last year I requested a report on the issue from the Central Bank. The Report entitled, 'Influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland' was subsequently published on the Department's website and is available here: <i>. <\/i><\/p><p>This research identified three main reasons for higher rates in Ireland.  First, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks. In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues.  Profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.<\/p><p>I also met with the main mortgage lenders in May last year and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to existing and new Irish mortgage customers was too high.\u00a0 The banks agreed to review their rates and products and to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for standard variable rate customers.  In September 2015 I concluded a series of\u00a0follow up meetings with these banks and I think that it is fair to say that there have been considerable movements in the mortgage offerings of the Irish banks in the last twelve months. \u00a0Furthermore, the fact that some of these offers have been\u00a0announced recently\u00a0is a vivid illustration of the effectiveness of the Government's policy, that competition is the best way to put pressure on the banks to reduce rates. <\/p><p>In this regard, I am pleased to note that a Central Bank statistical release of 10 June 2016 showed that Principal Dwelling House (PDH) mortgage rates fell across all instrument categories over the 12 month period ending in the first quarter of 2016.  The most pronounced fall was observed for standard variable rate mortgages which declined by 49 basis points to 3.64 per cent over the year ending Q1-2016.  Fixed rate PDH mortgage rates also declined, with rates fixed for 1-3 years falling by 34 basis points over the same period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300070#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Regulation","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300070#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[17790\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300070#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of life loans in respect of residential properties in issuance here; the total amount owed on these loans, if such loans are still being marketed by banks, if he is satisfied that consumers are being made fully aware of the risk associated with a life loan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Central Bank that Lifetime Loans are regarded as a niche product and they have not been provided in the Irish market for a number of years.

Its purpose is to discourage over-funding and over-accrual of pension benefits through tax-relieved and tax-subsidised arrangements.  The regime achieves this by imposing a significant tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. <\/p>  <p>  When the SFT limit was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 to a level of &euro;2.3 million, with effect from 7 December 2010, and was further reduced in Budget and Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 to &euro;2 million, with effect from 1 January 2014, the clear legal advice to the Government (as at the time of the original introduction of the regime in 2005) was that an individual who had pension rights in excess of the SFT limit at the relevant dates was entitled to protect or \"grandfather\" those rights.  Accordingly, the legislation provided that such individuals could protect their higher pension values, subject to certain ceilings and conditions, by applying to Revenue for a PFT certificate. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is seeking to establish the cumulative level of protection afforded and the estimated tax foregone resulting from the grandfathering arrangements outlined above.  In relation to the tax foregone as a result of the PFT legislation, the Revenue Commissioners are not in a position to compute this figure for a number of reasons such as, the fact that it is not known when exactly the individuals who have PFT's will retire; what tax free lump sums, if any, they may be entitled to take from their pension fund; what the tax rate will be when they retire and the size of their pension fund at retirement.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The concept of \"tax foregone\" is arguably more applicable in the context of tax reliefs where there is a choice as to whether to pursue the particular policy stance or not.  In that regard, it is important to note that these grandfathering arrangements were not considered optional and were provided in the legislation following legal advice to that effect from the Attorney General.  In other words, introducing the SFT regime to put an end to the provision of excessive pension pots at the expense of the general body of taxpayers required the simultaneous protection of pension rights that had been built up legitimately by individuals under the tax provisions that applied up to the relevant dates.  This was the firm legal advice to the Government when the SFT was introduced and on each subsequent occasion that the SFT limit was reduced.  The choice, therefore, was to introduce the SFT regime with grandfathering or not at all. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that in 2015 they issued a total of 501 PFT certificates with a total value of &euro;1,107 million.  The combined overall total number and value of PFT certificates issued since 7 December 2010 is 1,584 and &euro;4,387 million, respectively. <\/p>  <p>  The cumulative additional value of pension benefits protected in 2015 as compared with the SFT limits applying amounted to &euro;105 million.  The cumulative additional value of pension benefits protected as compared with the SFT limits applying at 7 December 2010 and 1 January 2014, respectively, amounts to &euro;942 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300070#WRG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":326,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300070#WRG02900"},{"type":"question","counter":327,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[17800\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300070#WRG03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the yield from excise duty and value added tax on the sale of alcoholic products, in each of the years from 2011 to 2015, broken down by reference to licensed premises and off-licences, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":328,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the total amount of revenue generated for the Exchequer in each of the past five years from Excise and VAT on Alcohol is as shown in the following table. <\/p><p>Information regarding the sale of alcohol either on or off premises is not available.

The Charter is an initiative of my Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, working in association with the Arts Council.  The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the Charter as providing an unprecedented opportunity for children and young people to engage in a proactive and meaningful way with arts in education in Ireland and commits to its implementation.  Good progress has been made on implementation of the Charter objectives, as set out below under a number of key headings.<\/p><p>A - The Arts in Education Portal <i>(<\/i>www.artsineducation.ie<i>)<\/i>: Ireland's first Arts in Education Portal, the key national digital resource for arts in education in Ireland, was launched in May 2015.  Since its launch up to the end of March 2016, there have been 18,145 visitors (per session) with 43,295 page views, an average of nearly 4,000 page views per month.  A celebration and demonstration of the success of the Portal formed part of the National Arts in Education Day, held at The Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) on 23rd April 2016.<\/p><p>B - Teacher &ndash; Artist Partnership as a model for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) initiative: An important development is the more focused attention to helping artists and teachers to develop together their understanding, expertise and creative pitch for arts in education work for children at different age levels.  A significant initiative in this regard was the initiation in 2014 by the Charter Group of a pioneering programme of joint teacher - artist collaboration in continuing professional development.  The scheme, 'Exploring Teacher Artist Partnership as a Model of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Supporting and Enhancing Arts Education', commenced in 2014.  It is intended that the Education Centres, responsible for local delivery of national programmes of teacher professional development on behalf of my Department, will have the capacity to implement this model locally and regionally into the future.  This will be possible through strategic planning involving collaboration and co-operation with the various Local Authority Arts Offices, art organisations, educational institutions and school communities.<\/p><p>C - Artists in Residencies in Higher Education Institutions: Significant developments regarding arts in education for initial teacher education have also been taking place.  Higher education institutions, particularly colleges of education, have been extending their offerings of arts in education courses and experience for student teachers.  The provision of a set of 'artists in residency' bursaries by the Arts Council, for such institutions, has been a major boost to this work.<\/p><p>D - Artists-Schools Guidelines: The Artists-Schools Guidelines were originally published in 2006. A number of changes have occurred in the arts in education landscape in Ireland since the Guidelines were first published.  A significant change arising from the Charter is the launch of a national digital resource for the arts in education at www.artsineducation.ie.  Given this changing landscape, the Arts Council, on behalf of the Implementation Group of the Arts in Education Charter, is currently reviewing the Artists-Schools Guidelines to examine whether and how they should be updated to continue to act as a useful resource.<\/p><p>E - Nationwide Mapping of Arts Provision, Relevant to Education: Planning is underway to incorporate a mapping of organisations, events, artists and locations at regional and local level throughout the country, which could be drawn upon for arts-in-education purposes.  This will be incorporated in the Arts-In-Education Portal on an incremental basis.  This could be a major resource for schools, and also help to highlight areas of limited or poor provision, with a view to its remediation.<\/p><p>F - ARIS &ndash; Arts Rich Schools: The Arts in Education Charter charges the Arts Council, in co-operation with the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht and my Department, with the promotion of Arts Rich Schools (ARIS).  According to the Charter &ndash; 'ARIS will incentivise and recognise those schools (primary and post-primary) which in a range of ways make the arts a key part of school life and place the arts centrally within the life of the school community affecting pupils primarily but also teachers, parents, other staff and community.'  A working group is assisting with the development of Ar&iacute;s and the development of a feasible implementation plan for a first phase of Arts over three years (2017-2019).<\/p><p>G - Research in Arts in Education: The Arts in Education Charter refers to the need for access to research that builds on existing good practice and explores new models of arts and school practice to create a source of knowledge and experience for policy makers and practitioners to draw on.  The Implementation Group has had communications with the Higher Education Authority, higher education institutions and associated bodies on how best a repository of such research can be established as an on-going source of such provision.  Discussions are still underway with the aim that such a National Digital Research Repository for Arts in Education would be established over the next 18 months. <\/p><p>H - Music Generation: The Music Generation initiative is co-ordinated and managed by Music Generation Ltd. through its National Development Office. Between 2010 and 2015, 11 Music Generation Music Education Partnerships (MEPs) were established as part of Phase 1 of the initiative, with the aim to provide non-mainstream vocal and instrumental music tuition for young people.  In 2015, Music Generation Ltd. announced Phase 2 of the initiative during which up to 9 additional new MEPs will be established over the period from 2016 up to 2020.Initial funding for 50% of Phase 1 of the Music Generation initiative came from philanthropic sources with the remaining 50% funding from MEPs, with the Exchequer taking up 50% funding after 3 years. Phase 2 will similarly funded.<\/p><p>I - Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme: The Department of Education and Skills also established the new Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme in February 2016, worth &euro;50,000.  The Purpose of the scheme is to provide support by way of a cash grant to established, smaller-scale, non-mainstream music education\/community music initiatives with limited or no access to other forms of public funding.<\/p><p>J - Local Arts Education Partnership (LAEPs): A further objective of the Charter which will make a major contribution to rooting arts in education at local and regional level as normative provision, is the Local Arts Education Partnerships (LAEPs).  The impact of co-operative efforts by the statutory agencies, the local authorities and the Education and Training Boards (ETBs), in conjunction with the regional Teacher Education Centres and other agencies, have potential to re-shape the landscape of arts in education provision in Ireland.<\/p><p>K - School Policies: The Charter envisages that schools, in their school policies and plans, shall incorporate arts in education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  Schools will be assisted by my Department in this aspect of their school planning and self-evaluation.  Making provision for arts in education practice will also be reflected in the design and equipping of school buildings.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has also established reciprocal partnership with the Arts Council in the promotion of the arts in schools, as set out in the Charter.<\/p><p>Implementation of the Arts in Education Charter is overseen by an Implementation Group, chaired by Professor John Coolahan.  The group reports bi-annually to me and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The group presented its fourth bi-annual report in April 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300072#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":410,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[17901\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300072#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of artist residencies provided within colleges of education with reference to the Arts In Education Charter; the location of these residencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":411,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the Arts in Education Charter as providing an unprecedented opportunity for children and young people to engage in a proactive and meaningful way with arts in education in Ireland and commits to its implementation.

Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  A landlord may not terminate a Part 4 tenancy except on clearly defined grounds which are set out in the Table to section 34 of the Act.  Where any rent owed by a tenant is in arrears for a period of 28 days or more, section 37(2) of the Act provides that the tenancy will be deemed to have been terminated by the tenant if the tenant has vacated the dwelling and no notice of termination has been served by the tenant in respect of the tenancy.

The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are currently based on the rent supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration.

There is no direct contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department.  Recent figures show that direct payments to nominated payees are made in approximately 12,300 cases (22% of cases).  In these cases the rent supplement recipient must continue to make arrangements to pay their minimum contribution required under the scheme directly to their landlord.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP).  The efficiency of the rent supplement scheme would be significantly affected if all payments were to be made directly to landlords, for the provision of a short term support.  Under HAP the local authority pays the full rent directly to the landlord with the HAP recipient required to make a differential rent contribution to the local authority.  HAP is currently operational in 19 local authority areas with payments being made in respect of over 10,370 tenancies.<\/p>  <p>  It remains open to the landlord to bring to the attention of this Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent.  Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.<\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that overpayments are prevented, and if they occur, they are regarded as a debt to the Exchequer and every effort is made to recover the amount over paid.  If the Deputy has details of a particular case where they suspect misuse of rent supplement, the details should be provided to my Department for review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300073#WRK03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":466,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300073#WRK03500"},{"type":"question","counter":467,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[17655\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300073#WRK03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to ensure that his Department releases the rent supplement for a person (details supplied).","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":468,"content":"<p>The person concerned was awarded a rent supplement under the rent supplement initiative in May 2014.

The income thresholds reflect a number of objectives: to maintain the incentive to take up employment; to reduce the risk of household poverty; and to provide a more consistent level of support per child to poor households.<\/p>  <p>  Between 2010 and 2015 FIS income thresholds remained unchanged.  In Budget 2016 they were raised by &euro;5 for families with one child and &euro;10 for families with two or more children, at a cost of &euro;18 million in a full year.  The average weekly payment made to families is currently estimated at &euro;135 per week.  Since 2010 the number of families in receipt of FIS has doubled.  <\/p>  <p>  Based on the most recent FIS recipient numbers from early June 2016, the cost of further increasing the weekly FIS income thresholds by &euro;5 per child per week is estimated to be in the region of &euro;19.2 million.  The cost of increasing the thresholds by &euro;10 per child per week is estimated to be in the region of &euro;38.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has no way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the potential in-flow from raising the income thresholds as proposed by the Deputy.  Therefore neither of the estimates above includes the potential additional costs associated with such a measure.  <\/p>  <p>  Any changes to the FIS income thresholds would have to be considered in an overall Budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300074#WRL02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Payments","counter":503,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300074#WRL02150"},{"type":"question","counter":504,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[17789\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300074#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of cases before the High Court in which the payment of child benefit is being contested on equality grounds; the implications of these cases for general policy in relation to payment of child benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

We have also provided over &euro;2 million since 2014 to our NGO partners for lifesaving emergency services to South Sudanese refugees in the Gambella camps in Ethiopia and the Adjumani camps in northern Uganda.

Ireland, along with its EU partners, supports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of those States.  Ireland has repeatedly raised the human rights situation in Syria and Iraq at the UN and the EU.  Ireland has called for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, given the multiple and credible reports of crimes requiring international action and the failure to prevent and reported accountability of the Syrian authorities for the overwhelming majority of these crimes.  Ireland has also repeatedly made clear its strong support for the UN-led negotiations to agree a political solution to the Syrian crisis, based on the 2012 Geneva Communique principles.  Ireland has urged international stakeholders, including the Assad regime&rsquo;s backers, to give their full backing to the UN process.   The Government is also strongly supportive of the 2014 political reform and national reconciliation programme announced by PM Abadi of Iraq.  Integration of all religious and ethnic groups in Iraq is a vital response to supporting Iraq&rsquo;s unity, integrity and sovereignty.  This is a critical political response to parallel security efforts to confront Daesh and to end the threat of jihadist terrorism and the safe haven posed by Daesh control of parts of the territory of Syria and Iraq. <\/p>  <p>  The domestic situation in Turkey remains a matter of concern, both for Ireland and our European partners.  I would like to reiterate the serious concern I have expressed several times already in this House at the escalation of violence since the breakdown of the ceasefire between the Turkish Government and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) last summer.  This breakdown has been all the more regrettable given that there were positive signs in the peace process as recently as early 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the peace talks between the Turkish Government and the PKK and, through the work of the Conflict Resolution Unit of my Department, financial assistance has been provided to an international NGO which has facilitated study visits to Ireland by Turkish and Kurdish MPs, journalists, and advisers working for peace.  The current situation demonstrates clearly the critical importance for all sides to cease hostilities and return to dialogue and I take this opportunity to urge again all sides to do so.  The most recent Progress Report on Turkey, published by the European Commission in November 2015, emphasised the importance of this too. <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has participated in discussions at the European Council on the issue of human rights in Syria, Iraq and Turkey.

The NHQRS was established to provide a broad overall picture of the quality of our health services.  It is intended to demonstrate to individual hospitals and other health service providers the importance of examining their own data in order to improve the services they provide. It must however, be understood that the performance and quality of a service cannot be measured by one indicator alone.  This is why the NHQRS presents an  analysis of a range of indicators that reflect different parts of the services and allows progress and priorities in the health system to be identified.  The NHQRS will help to inform many improvements in service outcomes for patients. <\/p>  <p>  The information will inform my priorities as Minister for Health, it will provide intelligence and information for the 10 Year Plan for Health and I hope the Health Committee will avail of the opportunity to be briefed on this.  It will also inform my Department's Statement of Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  The Second annual NHQRS Report was published last Thursday 16th June.  It is very encouraging to see  improvements in many areas, for example in the areas of immunisation, uptake of cancer screening and survival rates for patients with breast and colorectal cancer  which are improving at a rate faster than most other European countries in the OECD.  One example of how this information will be used is to ensure that the cancer indicators feed into the new Cancer Strategy currently being drawn up by my Department.    Similarly, the figures for stroke patients, indicate  over 80% are admitted to hospitals with a designated stroke unit which, again, is to the forefront of other OECD countries. <\/p>  <p>  I recognise that there are areas identified where further room for improvement exists. In particular, considerable variation can be seen between counties in rates of hospitalisation for common chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, diabetes and heart failure. Identifying this variation is a first step to addressing the reasons why this variation exists and to improving it.  For example, the information on COPD is already informing requirements in Primary Care and the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) COPD Guideline being developed by the HSE Clinical Programme for the management of this disease.<\/p>  <p>  It is international standard best practice not to report rates for small numbers such as hospitals with less than 100 cases as outlined in the NHQRS Report.  The number of cases for each hospital are, however, reported in the NHQRS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300077#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":625,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300077#WRO01550"},{"type":"question","counter":626,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[17649\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300077#WRO01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"to grant funding to a school (details supplied) in order that they may maintain the services they provide, after a hospital withdrew funding from the school, resulting in the loss of vocational education services.","asker":"1305","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":627,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

It is currently being provided to a cohort of patients involved in the piloting and feasibility study for Suboxone. <\/p>  <p>  At the request of the Department of Health, the HSE set up an implementation group to introduce, supervise, monitor and review the wider availability and cost of buprenorphine\/naloxone products for opioid substitution therapy.  In January 2016 the Director General of the HSE submitted the report of this Opioid Substitution Implementation Group to my predecessor, the Minister of State with special responsibility for drugs strategy.  No decision on the report was taken at that time. The report recommends the phased, increased access to buprenorphine\/naloxone for a cohort of patients in specific circumstances, subject to required legislation being enacted and resourcing.  It was noted in the report that additional funding would be required and that these additional resources for 2016 had not been allocated.  <\/p>  <p>  The mechanisms proposed in this report will require legislative changes to be made.  If the provision of Suboxone is to be given the same statutory basis as methadone, in order to ensure its safe, appropriate and cost-effective use, an amendment to the Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations 1998 will be necessary. <\/p>  <p>  The Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2015 was enacted as emergency legislation in March 2015 following a Court of Appeal decision on a constitutional challenge to section 2(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  The 2015 Act reconfirmed the existing Ministerial regulations and orders made under the 1977 Act, including the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 and the 1998 Methadone Regulations.  As a result, these Regulations may only now be amended by primary legislation. <\/p>  <p>  As you know, on Tuesday the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2016 was published.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to protect public health by bringing certain substances which are open to misuse and known to be traded on the illicit market under the scope of the Misuse of Drugs legislation, as well as aiding the law enforcement functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service.  The Bill provides for a small number of other amendments of a technical nature including the &lsquo;unlocking&rsquo; of the previously confirmed Regulations and Ministerial Orders.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that this Bill can be enacted before the summer recess.  Controlling the substances in the Bill is part one of a two-step process.  Regulations are also required to allow legitimate users (patients with a prescription, health professionals) to possess the newly controlled substances.  Work is underway on drafting these regulations as a matter of priority.  Any regulations made in relation to buprenorphine\/naloxone will be drafted subsequent to this legislative agenda and will then be subject to the 3-month EU notification under the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive 2015\/1535\/EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300078#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[17676\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300078#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on the fact that according to recent research published by Health Research Board, there has been an increase in the number of persons dying from methadone overdoses, with the number of deaths due to methadone overdoses, the largest cause of deaths by poisoning in Ireland, ahead of even heroin overdoses; if, based on this data on methadone overdoses, he will fast-track the availability of Suboxone, to provide an alternative to methadone, as a way to reduce such overdose risks, given the much lower risk of overdose from Suboxone; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":655,"content":"<p>According to a Health Research Board report on drug-related deaths for 2013, the latest year for which data is available, the total number of drug-related poisoning deaths increased from 361 in 2012 to 387 in 2013.  Methadone was implicated in 93 poisoning deaths in 2013, compared with 86 in 2012.  However, the majority of poisoning deaths  where methadone was implicated, involved other drugs.  There is clear evidence to indicate that having access to drug treatment is one of the major factors in reducing drug-related deaths.  <\/p>  <p>  Suboxone is a medicinal product comprising the drugs buprenorphine and naloxone.  It is authorised as a substitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment.

The report recommends the phased increased access to buprenorphine\/naloxone for a cohort of patients in specific circumstances, including the resources required, subject to the required legislation being enacted to provide buprenorphine\/naloxone on the same statutory basis as methadone.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist which is used to reverse the effects of overdose of opioids such as heroin, morphine and methadone and has been proven to be an effective way of reducing the number of opioid overdose deaths.  In May 2015, the HSE undertook a demonstration project to assess and evaluate the suitability and impact of using a pre-filled Naloxone injection which is designed for non-medical administration in Ireland.  The project involved 600 opiate users receiving take-home naloxone on prescription.  It also included those recently released from custody who have been identified as at high risk of opioid overdose.  These drug users and those close to them have been trained on how to administer naloxone and to recognise the signs of an overdose.  The HSE has advised that an evaluation of the demonstration project has been completed and a national implementation plan is currently being developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300078#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Allowances","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300078#WRP01050"},{"type":"question","counter":657,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[17686\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016062300078#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost of reintroducing allowances for public sector workers in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":658,"content":"<p>The outcome of the Review of Public Sector Allowances was published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 18 September 2012. <\/p>  <p>  The Delegates (and Chairpersons) Allowance (payable to officials who travel outside of Ireland and the UK to represent Ireland at meetings of the EU or other international organisations, or who act as Chairpersons of EU committees) was abolished for both new beneficiaries and existing staff.

The Programme&rsquo;s\u00a0content and design was formulated in light of previous experience and performance and reflects the outcome of extensive stakeholder consultation and does not include support for anaerobic digesters or bio-energy production on farms.  Both anaerobic digestion and bio-energy production were previously funded under the RDP and nationally but uptake was unsatisfactory and interest in the schemes generally poor.  Under the Rural Development Programme 2000 -2006 a Pilot Waste Processing Facilities Scheme made funding available for the installation of anaerobic digesters on 10 Irish farms.  Of the 10 applicants who were approved under the scheme,\u00a0two applications were finalised and drew down the grant available and a further two cases have been given an extension to the end of 2016 to complete the work. <\/p>  <p>  The Bio-Energy Scheme commenced in 2007 on a nationally funded pilot basis and continued to be nationally funded until 2010.  The scheme was co-funded under the RDP 2007-2013 for the years from 2011 to 2014.  The Bioenergy Scheme 2015 provided once off capital grants up to 40% subject to a maximum of &euro;1,040 per hectare to facilitate the establishment of willow for use in renewable energy production.  Previous schemes had covered both willow and miscanthus. \u00a0Grant aid was payable in respect of ground preparation, seed purchase and planting costs.  Up take on the Scheme was poor and attracted only four applications.  The 2015 Scheme was nationally funded.  The continuation of the scheme of support for the growing of bio-energy crops\u00a0is currently under review. <\/p>  <p>  On the broader issue of support for renewable energy, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources leads in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy policy and oversees the Renewable Electricity Feed-in Tariff (REFIT) schemes.  These Schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid.  The schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period.  The technologies supported include onshore wind energy, hydroelectricity, landfill gas, waste-to-energy and biomass technologies, including anaerobic digestion.  Electricity and\u00a0heat\u00a0produced from\u00a0anaerobic digestion (AD)\u00a0are\u00a0supported under the REFIT 3 scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is currently examining the design and cost of introducing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) to encourage the development of Ireland&rsquo;s abundant and indigenous renewable energy resources.

When finalised shortly there will be some 6,000 successful applicants under the 2015 National Reserve.  As all of the National Reserve funding has been utilised, there is no funding available to cover the operation of a 2016 National Reserve.  For 2016 the only source of funding available to the National Reserve will be from &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; on the sale of entitlements without land and indications are that the level of funds that will arise from &lsquo;clawback&rsquo; during the 2016 scheme year will be minimal.  The Regulations also provide that Member States may apply a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements in order to provide funding for the National Reserve. <\/p>  <p>  The operation of a National Reserve for 2016 would require the re-opening of the 2016 Basic Payment Scheme for applications as, under EU Regulation, applicants to the National Reserve must also submit a valid Basic Payment Scheme application for the year in which they submit the National Reserve application.  As the closing date for Basic Payment Scheme applications has now passed, farmers have finalised arrangements regarding the declaration of land for the 2016 scheme year which would have implications for potential National Reserve applicants.  The re-opening of Basic Payment Scheme applications at this stage would likely delay the processing of such applications for 2016, with the consequent potential for delay in payments.  Furthermore at this stage many young farmers may have entered arrangements to lease in entitlements in 2016 in order to avail of the Greening payment and Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme payment.<\/p>  <p>  From 2017 onwards the National Reserve will be replenished from unused entitlements, as EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that entitlements that are unused for 2 consecutive years are surrendered to the National Reserve.

With these significant\u00a0changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar PV in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, to contribute to our renewable energy targets and to support economic growth and jobs.  It is also recognised however, that while the cost competitiveness of solar PV has improved, it would still require a subsidy in order to be developed on a commercial basis.<\/p><p>Work is now on-going to examine the design and cost of introducing a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) to encourage the development of Ireland&rsquo;s abundant and indigenous renewable energy resources.  This scheme will examine the economic viability of supporting a range of new renewable energy technologies in Ireland - including solar - and will help to further reduce energy-related emissions. \u00a0While the scheme is not purposely designed to meet our 2020 obligations it is likely to make some contribution to those targets.<\/p><p>The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity are the REFIT (Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff) schemes.  While the REFIT schemes are now closed to new applications,\u00a0the schemes cover a range of technologies, including wind energy, biomass technologies and landfill gas.  The REFIT schemes have proven very successful at incentivising the\u00a0increase\u00a0in the use of renewable energy in Ireland.  A\u00a0report published by the Council for European Energy Regulators found Ireland to have one of the lowest levels of monetary support per unit of gross electricity produced and maintaining this value for money for end consumers will be an important element of any new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme.<\/p><p>While the inherent benefits of an increased use of renewable energy in Ireland are apparent in terms of\u00a0displacement of fossil fuels, consequent emissions reductions, increased security of supply and reducing the potential impact of fossil fuel price volatility, it is equally important to understand the potential cost of this transition.<\/p><p>Quantifying this cost is a complex task due to the number of influencing components.  For example, while renewable electricity generation introduces savings by reducing the need to burn fossil fuels, this\u00a0is offset\u00a0to\u00a0a certain extent\u00a0by increased costs of system operation, the need for additional network investment and the capital and operational costs of the renewable generators.  In the past a number of studies have been completed by various parties in the energy sector focusing on particular aspects of this issue.  However, a broad based analysis\u00a0is being\u00a0finalised\u00a0by my Department, the SEAI, Eirgrid and the CER, which\u00a0looks at the range of components contributing to the projected costs and the financial impact on the electricity customer.
