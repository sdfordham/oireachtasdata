I thank the officials from my Department, whom I have introduced, for their hard and detailed work on the review and for providing the committee with all the information it required for this meeting and in relation to its further discussions in regard to other sectors.  A large volume of information on allowances has been provided which it is hoped will be of help to the committee.  We are also available to provide further information if members of the committee feel that is useful.<\/p><p>  Last week, I briefed the committee on the overall aims of the review of public service allowances and the next steps proposed in each sector.  Today, I will speak about allowances which are common to two or more Departments within the Civil Service.  Members will be aware that the allowances review conducted by the Department is the first comprehensive public service-wide attempt to address outdated allowance-based pay structures across the public service, many of which date back to the 1920s and have built up progressively over the years to address many different issues at particular times.  The review to date is the first step of an ongoing process.  It is also only one element of a sustained programme of cost reduction and productivity increases across the public service.<\/p><p>  Members will be aware from previous discussions that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and Government have set out a plan to reduce the overall cost of the public sector by 20% between 2008 and 2015, through a variety of different measures.  My purpose here is to speak on the review as it relates to the very small number of Civil Service allowances common to two or more Departments.  The committee has been provided with information in respect of those allowances, the cost of which to the system is &euro;4.7 million, with most being paid to the lowest paid grades in the Civil Service.  I will comment further on these allowances later.  I have also been requested by the committee to discuss allowances paid to Members and parties of the Oireachtas and I am happy to do so.<\/p><p>  It is important to point out that the term \"allowances\" covers a wide variety of payment types, namely, reimbursement of expenses, payments for qualifications held and allowances which were introduced in recognition of particular duties being undertaken.  In the context of the review, it was evident that many allowances were used or retained as a supplement to basic salary for particular groups.  This is particularly relevant in the context of those allowances pertaining to the Civil Service.  While they may have been introduced for a valid purpose, in particular to resolve a dispute in the era of pay relativities, they continue to be paid despite that justification for them no longer holds.<\/p><p>  It is our view that allowances should only be payable in circumstances that meet the criteria set out for the review.  Those criteria are that they should reflect the arduous nature of unsocial hours, including the need to remain on call at weekends and other times, clearly associated with the duties of posts, they should ensure work of additional value is actually received by an employer, or they should cover an actual cost accruing to the employee derived from their employment.  These are the important criteria set out as the basis for this review.<\/p><p>  The common Civil Service allowances are those in payment on the same basis in two or more Departments across the Civil Service.  These allowances form only a small part of the overall Civil Service pay bill.<\/p> <p>Based on the data submitted to the Department for 2011, they cost an estimated &euro;4.7 million.  This represents 0.35% of the overall pay bill for the Civil Service, which for 2011 was &euro;1.34 billion.  This is a very small quantum of money in percentage terms, probably smaller than any other sector the committee will have the opportunity to review.<\/p><p> Allowances do not normally form a part of the pay of civil servants, who generally receive basic salaries only.  No duty-based allowance is payable to senior management such as Secretaries General or assistant secretaries.  One group of allowances was paid to management grades, primarily principal and assistant principal officers, and higher executive officers, for attendance at overseas meetings.  These were the chairpersons' and delegates' allowances, which made up 17% of the overall cost of allowances in the Civil Service in 2011 and amounted to &euro;800,000.  This cost was expected to increase during the course of the forthcoming EU Presidency in 2013.  The Government decided to abolish this allowance for current incumbents and new beneficiaries following the review, and this decision has been notified to Departments.  Of the &euro;4.7 million costs in 2011, &euro;800,000 was for this allowance, which has been abolished.  The 0.35% share of the pay bill will be lower for 2013 when the decision is rolled out throughout the system.<\/p><p> The largest number of the common civil service allowances, 14 of the 20, are paid to service officers, who are a group of low paid civil servants.  The wages of service officers vary from &euro;398.74 a week to a maximum of &euro;495.55 a week.  Like the pay in some other sectors, over many decades their basic pay rates have been supplemented by allowances.  The allowances are payable for specific additional tasks.  The review concluded that a medium-term review and restructuring of the pay arrangements for these grades is merited.<\/p><p> The review also found that the retention of a part of the allowances paid to Ministers' private secretaries after they completed their duties was no longer merited.  Private secretaries to Ministers could retain 50% of the allowance after they ceased being private secretaries.  New individuals taking up these posts will not be able to retain this allowance after they leave.<\/p><p> Other than these, the review found the remaining small number of the common civil service allowances in payment are justified, as one might expect given the small number that fall within the category.  They provide value to the employer, apply to a small number of personnel and are mostly paid to staff at the lower end of the salary scale.  The Department will engage with staff interests through the various representative councils with a view to securing their early agreement to the changing or elimination of certain allowances we have identified.  I am happy to discuss these common allowances for the Civil Service with the committee and answer any questions from members.<\/p><p> In this session the committee intends to examine the allowances paid to Members and parties in the Oireachtas.  While the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is the regulatory authority with regard to the Oireachtas allowances regime, the amounts paid under this regime to Members of the Oireachtas are administered and paid for by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The Accounting Officer, Mr. Coughlan, is present to speak to the payment of these allowances.  The only allowance paid directly by the Department to Members or parties is the party leaders' allowance and the Minister has indicated his intention to review this.  For the committee's information, this cost &euro;7.92 million in 2011.  We are happy to assist the committee in its work this afternoon and in subsequent reviews of various sectors and I ask the Chairman to let us know if we can provide any further information or assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300003#B00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350997800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I am glad to have this opportunity to address the committee on this issue.  In my letter of 4 October to the clerk to the committee I outlined under broad headings, the various allowances paid to Members.  Article 15.15 of the Constitution stipulates that provision be made by law for the payment of allowances to Members of the Oireachtas in respect of their duties as public representatives and for travelling and other facilities in connection with these duties.  Expenditure under these various headings has fallen broadly in line with other cuts in the public service generally.  I have circulated a detailed breakdown of these figures relating to each allowance.<\/p><p>  From this breakdown it is clear the principal allowance is the parliamentary standard allowance, PSA, which is provided for under the 2009 legislation which consolidated the allowances into one allowance, the PSA, with two tranches, namely, the travel and accommodation allowance, TAA, and the public representation allowance, PRA.  The scheme which came into operation in March 2010 was also innovative in providing greater transparency in terms of verification and coincided with a number of budgetary cuts imposed by the then Minister for Finance across the public service.<\/p><p>  To put the PSA scheme in perspective, since there is often incorrect speculation on what allowances our parliamentarians are provided with, the total spend on Members' expenses this year will be approximately &euro;11.7 million or 11% of the total parliamentary budget.  The corresponding figure for Members' salaries is just under &euro;20 million or 18.3%.  The total spend on allowances and salaries this year, therefore, will be &euro;31.7 million.  This represents a fall of approximately 16% since 2008 when the total spend was &euro;36.7 million and represents a tiny fraction - one thousandth - of total State expenditure for 2012.  Of course, this is not to belittle what is a significant sum or to say that we should not have excellent monitoring, audit and control systems around the expenditure, which we do, but simply to position the sums involved in the overall picture.<\/p><p>  All allowances bar two are statutorily based and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, as Mr. Watt indicated, is the regulatory authority who, under law, sets the rates and scope of the allowances.  The PSA is under review by the Minister.  A review was earmarked originally to be undertaken within a year of the new scheme but was delayed due to the 2011 general election.  For obvious reasons of a potential conflict of interest, neither the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission nor Members can set the rates or scope of these allowances.  However, as an aside and in view of the apparent persistent negativity in regard to any expenditure in this area, the question arises as to whether it is time for the Minister's role in setting the rates and scope of allowances to be changed to an independent body, as is the practice in other countries.  I suggest consideration of this option from the perspective of ensuring public trust in how these public funds are accounted for but also as it may help insulate our parliamentary democracy and our parliamentarians from unfair commentary that is corroding the public's trust.<\/p><p>  Longer serving committee members will recall that the higher body on remuneration used to include Members' allowances in its review in the late 1980s and 1990s.  While the review body decided subsequently in 1996 in effect to leave claims for improvements in expense allowances and facilities to the Minister for Finance, many of the key elements of the system of allowances as we knew it up to the change in 2010 arose from analysis and recommendations by the independent review body.  Unlike other Civil Service and public service allowances, Members' allowances, being statutorily based, are not amenable to being the subject of business cases.  For all of these reasons, it may be more appropriate to have the review of allowances for Members restored in the future to an independent body review mechanism.<\/p><p>  In the context of this committee's review of allowances, it is important to draw a distinction between allowances for Members and other public service allowances.  By definition Members of the Oireachtas are not public servants in the accepted sense of being an employee.  The allowances and expenses system for Members is thus not a regime of company expenses but a series of payments provided for in the Constitution and set mainly by law arising from election to or appointment as a Member of the Oireachtas.  The payment of the expenses incurred is subject to the normal system of Civil Service administrative controls, and the rates applicable for Members' travel and accommodation expenses are based on the rates payable to public servants.<\/p><p>  The role of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service is thus to ensure the payments are made in compliance with our system of financial controls and in accordance with the laws providing for them.  In this regard it should be noted the statutory schemes require self-certification by Members and thus operate to a very significant extent on trust.  That being said, there is a robust system of financial controls in place.  For example, the Members' public representation allowance has been subject to two independent external audits since its inception in 2010.  Moreover, in 2009 the internal auditor for the Houses of the Oireachtas Service conducted an audit of the payment systems and administrative control procedures for Members' allowances and the processing of these allowances was found to be satisfactory with many strong controls in place.<\/p><p>  I have tried to give a brief pen picture of the Members' allowance regime and to draw the distinction between these and other allowances under the committee's examination and I have emphasised, as with all public expenditure, that the expenses are subject to rigorous financial controls within the relevant law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Coughlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1350997800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.

I do not see the logic of that.  There is a big disparity between the vouched and unvouched options.

Understandably, hard-pressed taxpayers would question the existence of a party leader's allowance.  If we are going to reform politics and phase out corporate donations with all the negativity that brings, the party leader's allowance becomes all the more central in terms of funding democracy but, as with other things, it must be accounted for.  It jumps out as very odd that the allowances paid to each of the political parties must be accounted for, which is as it should be, but that payments made to Independent Deputies and Senators are not scrutinised in the same way.

Based on the distance from Leinster House and if a Member travels his or her required amount per annum, his or her payment is divided into 12 equal instalments and he or she gets it by electronic payment at the end of each month.  We had a controversy in the month of August when many Deputies were not here.  Given how the Houses of the Oireachtas Service processes the payments, the public understandably came to the conclusion that Deputies were claiming and were being paid travel expenses to and from the D&aacute;il when many Deputies did not travel.  That system of payment was damaging to the body politic.<\/p><p>  At the end of each month the Houses of the Oireachtas Service knows how many times we clocked in during the month.  Given that it is in the service's computerised system it would not be too complicated to issue the cheque as follows.  If I travel to Leinster House six times one month, 22 times the next month and seven times the following month, I would get paid for that.  It should not be an administrative burden.  I do not need to submit documentation - it is all on the electronic fob.  During months when the D&aacute;il is in recess and over the Christmas period, when Members would not be travelling to and from Leinster House, we would avoid cheques being sent to Members for what the public rightly believe is for travel to and from Leinster House.  Instead of taking the handy administrative procedure of dividing the annual amount by 12 monthly payments, the service should pay it on the amount of travel undertaken and have it reflected monthly.  Then we might find a number of visits during the months of March, April and May and a lower amount of visits in July and August.  The payments to us would then reflect our attendance here, as they should.  Treating it differently has been damaging to the body politic.

Mr. Coughlan said earlier that 39 Deputies claimed the lower, unvouched amount.  If those 39 Deputies claimed the full amount, the extra &euro;10,700, it would be an extra cost of &euro;612,300 to the taxpayer.  If the 12 Ministers who are claiming the smaller amount claimed the maximum vouched amount, it would be an extra cost of &euro;96,000 to taxpayer.

So rather than having a pay-scale director, they stay on the PO scale and they get an allowance.  It is analogous to the situation in the education system where a teacher is made principal and gets an allowance for being a principal.  That component is called the principal allowance when, of course, it should be a different pay scale for principal - absolutely.  It is just the way the system has built up over time.  Our preference would be - the Minister has said this - that allowances that are clearly pay for, as the Deputy says, higher duties for different responsibilities should be called pay.  That is the exercise we are going to have to engage in to clear all this up and clean it up.

We have spoken about allowances in the public service and Civil Service and one knows what was expected of the paperkeeper or franker in respect of the allowance they received.  However, it appears we are locked into a system of payments and no one has related these payments to the costs involved in being a Member of the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  Such figures could be applied to the various allowances.  The reason I am raising this is because I have always argued allowances should be vouched.  Someone should quantify what it is all about.  My question is with regard to who will address this.  We fob in here for a certain number of days, but no one fobs me in or out of my constituency office when I work there.  No one physically checks on the size my office, how I conduct my business or how long I am there.<\/p><p>  Deputy McDonald referred to the Chairman's allowance.<\/p> <p>I will not defend it in any way but nobody has made an assessment of what they do for that money.  Are extra hours really put in in terms of chairing this or any other meeting of the committee?  I do not mind doing my job but in terms of being paid for expenses or allowances that are properly and legitimately incurred in the course of those duties, I believe Mr. Watt, the Minister and Mr. Coughlan and his officials should have a greater understanding of the costs of how we actually function.  I am not making any case for us.  I am simply saying that this would be done in business.  One would find out what one's 226 cost centres are about and what it is that they do.  Is that what we are electing and paying them to do?  When one gets elected here, as Deputy Murphy said, one is given one's book about how the House functions and allowances and so on.  Mr. Watt mentioned it in terms of people consulting us about what we do and how we influenced those decisions in the past to increase the levels of allowances or not.  However, people are paid to sit in the committee at &euro;9,500 per head and I do not know whether that is value for money.  I would ask the Department and the Houses of the Oireachtas Service to look at what we do in this House.  How do they know if they are getting value for money out of me or anybody else in this House.<\/p><p> To address a point raised by Deputy Fleming because it is a legitimate one, if all of these people - 39 Deputies, 12 Ministers and 44 Senators - were to claim their allowances at the higher level, how does one know they will claim them at this level?  How does one know that they run an office that costs them \"X\" amount for electricity or the telephone because one does not know?  The basis for any system must be based on the reality of what is happening to Senators, Deputies and Ministers.  I cannot understand how when one is appointed a junior or senior Minister, one goes from this place and has allowances from here but the Department pays one something else.  That needs to be analysed and to stand up in terms of the argument for it.  Then we might not have the type of negative commentary or misunderstanding we get from the public because it is a factual thing.  If that is seen as being reasonable to ask for, who will undertake that analysis of the cost?  Will it be Mr. Coughlan or Mr. Watt?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300014#N02900","speaker":"965","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351004400,"counter":437,"content":"<p>It is certainly not myself or our Department.

I apologise for being late as I was in another meeting.  The point made by Deputy McDonald is very fair.  Many of these allowances are doing a disservice to people in the public service, and a number of people I have met who are civil and public servants are nearly embarrassed by the legacy system that exists.  They want to see it reformed.  Where an allowance is pay for additional responsibilities, such a system also exists in the private sector.  People doing a different job would get additional pay, and calling it an allowance is a bit of a misnomer.  Such payments are grouped with allowances that are indefensible and outdated.<\/p><p>  If the witness has answered any of my questions, he should feel free to tell me.  I will certainly make my contribution to the committee's report on the business cases.  The phrase \"business cases\" leaves much to be desired.  I have read many of these and they are not really business cases because they are very sparse on detail.  In some cases they do not answer all the questions that have been put.  I take the point that resources are deployed to where the most savings can be made for the taxpayer but this committee will have quite a bit to say about the issue of business cases.<\/p><p>  We spoke about the 1,100 allowances but where do we want to get to in terms of numbers?  How far are we down the road?  I presume that even after we have carried out wonderful reforms and streamlined elements into core pay, there will be a number of remaining allowances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300018#R01100","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351006200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy about the legacy.  Within the Department we are trying to deal with a variety of legacy issues across the public service in this and other areas.  There must be a sense of realism in that even with the burning platform of our current fiscal deficit, there is the issue of the system's capacity to address these within a timeframe.  I share the Deputy's views about allowances, and the way this has been portrayed has not been very good for the public service, with much misinformation in the public domain.  We must move on to modernise the structures, ensuring that pay reflects higher duties.<\/p><p>  With regard to the business cases, perhaps that was not the best way to describe many of the submissions, although some are better than others.  We welcome the views of the Deputy and the committee in that regard.  We initiated this process, which had never been done before, and colleagues deserve credit for providing enormous amounts of information and getting to the bottom of an element of the pay bill which was very unclear.  People did not previously have good sight on this but that has been remedied.  The Minister and colleagues should be commended on starting the review, although there has not been much credit because of how it worked out.  I accept the point about the business cases.<\/p><p>  From the 1,100 allowances, I suspect that after a certain period we will have a good deal fewer.  The best way to view this may be through the value of the allowances.  The main elements that formulate the largest part of the pay bill will be in some way incorporated into pay and there will be clearer pay scales and structures.  We wish for the qualifications and principal allowance for teachers, or the rent allowance for garda&iacute;, for example, which make up the largest portion of the pay bill, to be subsumed - as the Minister noted - into a sensible pay structure.  I imagine there will be fewer allowances and people will not have as much fun as we have had going through them all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300018#R01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>Is there a timeline on moving the priority allowances?

It has created a two-tier process in how we view different people in the public sector.<\/p><p>  When we had representatives of the Defence Forces before us last week, it was nearly embarrassing to be an Irish citizen, let alone a public representative, when we saw the measly salaries that some privates in the Defence Forces earn.  From what I can see, when the nation had money, rather than addressing the fact that some privates in the Army earned in and around the minimum wage, if not less, we threw them a few allowances.  Rather than grappling with the fact that these people were grossly underpaid and earning less than the minimum wage, we gave out the allowances.

It is an observation to think about more than a direct question.  We speak about office accommodation being provided in Leinster House for Deputies whose staff are based here.  That is fine and I have no issue with that.  I am just trying to separate them from those who are claiming.  I am also following on from questions asked by the Chairman.  He asked if anybody had checked out the cost of running a constituency operation, whether in Dublin 4 or west Cork.  The cost might be different.  I would link that to the remarks made by Mr. Watt.<\/p><p>  There has been about a 10% reduction in public service numbers in recent years.  Even in the Civil Service, the numbers have dropped by about 3,000.  Let me make a suggestion as a cost saving measure in regard to expenses for Deputies.  It is something I have suggested publicly on a number of occasions previously.  If Deputies choose to have their staff based in Leinster House, that is fine but if Deputies do not, they should be allocated space in government or a local government office in their constituency.<\/p><p>  Some 3,000 staff have left the Civil Service.  It was said that 127 of us have claimed a grant for setting up a constituency office.  I can think of no constituency where there would not be space in a government office, a Department which has been decentralised or a local council office.  We might not even need to go to the HSE. A formula could be worked out that a Deputy is entitled to 1,200 sq. ft of office space to cover staff and meet members of the public.  That could be allocated to a Deputy.  I believe there is excess space and probably excess furniture as a result of the 3,000 staff who have left.<\/p><p>  Some people might resist this and say the Deputy must be independent of the public service because sometimes we must battle with public servants and we do not want to meet them in the canteen at lunch time.  However, there is an opportunity, if people think outside the box, to provide space in public buildings.  There would be no basis whatsoever for Deputies to submit any expenses, vouched or unvouched, for constituency offices.  It would result in a major saving and a rationalisation of locations.  It could be done at minimal cost and it would remove Deputies from the process entirely.  People would see one's office in a government building in a town.  I am sure the OPW could offer a suite of facilities with the required space and suitable for any Deputy.  <\/p><p>  We are in an unusual position.  To do our job as semi-public servants, we have to source and pay for our own office accommodation, desks and telephones and then put in a claim.  No one else in the public service is expected to provide their own accommodation and seek reimbursement for the cost of providing their own telephone and photocopier.  We should be offered facilities in a government office in our constituencies.  It would remove this item from the debate.  I ask Mr. Watt to think about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300019#S00600","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006800,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I bag Farmleigh - I want to get in early.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300019#S00700","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006800,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Watt take my point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300019#S00800","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351006800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300019#S00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006800,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions and Mr. Watt and Mr. Coughlan and their officials for attending this meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2012102300019#S01000","speaker":"965"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351006800,"counter":566,"content":"<p>The witnesses withdrew.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351006800,"counter":567,"content":"<p>The committee adjourned at 4.55 p.m. until 11.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 24 October 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine","time":1350997200,"counter":568},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>The Joint Committee met at 14:00<\/p><p>MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Deputy Tom Barry, Senator Michael Comiskey, Deputy Pat Deering, Senator Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill, Deputy Colm Keaveney, Senator Susan O'Keeffe, Deputy Michael McNamara, Senator Pat O'Neill.

The combination of research and innovation support in one organisation uniquely positions Teagasc to ensure effective and efficient knowledge transfer in rural areas to generate sustainable wealth creation.  This marks Teagasc apart from other knowledge providers, such as those in the higher education sector.  The organisation conducts knowledge management activities in the agrifood sector through research to generate and procure new knowledge and information, advice in transferring information, and education and training to increase capacity of people within programmes.<\/p><p> Teagasc has identified information and communication technology, ICT, as one of the major opportunities available to increase the adoption of key technologies at farm level and to assist in the delivery of modern advisory services to Irish farmers.  Under continuous efficiency gains, Teagasc has implemented an organisational change programme in recent years in order to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and delivers value for public money.  The implication of this is that in the future Teagasc will be a smaller, highly innovative, efficient and focused organisation.<\/p><p> Teagasc has used computerisation of farmer information since the 1970s when it provided computerised analysis of farm performance for comparison or benchmarking purposes.  Examples include DairyMIS, which was used to analyse data on farm efficiency factors and the national farm survey analysis, which is used for economic research purposes and international comparisons.  The information Teagasc collects and processes is a very important asset in showing progress over time and in providing information which is independently verifiable to farmers and policy makers.  Teagasc also maintains a database of soil analysis results and the soils map of Ireland, which are important for ongoing essential planning.  Computerisation has helped Teagasc to be more effective in how it does its work.<\/p><p> The research, advisory and educational support for the development of Irish agriculture is critical for the future.  The ambitious targets for expansion in Food Harvest 2020 and the ongoing challenges of reduced staffing and budgets are pressure points forcing prioritisation of our resources and activities.  Teagasc sees the investment in information and communication technology as part of it doing its job better.  Teagasc participated in a number of e-Government projects as part of the information society fund, which encouraged increased efficiency in the delivery of public services.  The Teagasc e-college, e-profit monitor and soil analysis online were some of the projects which qualified for support.<\/p><p> Teagasc has from the outset promoted and supported the use of third-party farm software.  The reality is that these packages are very good recording and analysis tools and are used on several Teagasc farms for livestock management.  However, the world has moved on and the means by which data are collected, shared and used are completely different today than in the 1980s and 1990s.  Teagasc has a responsibility to its clients to give them accurate and specific advice based on farmers' own information and information from research and similar farms.  The benchmarking of farm performance is from the days of DairyMIS to today, with the Teagasc e-profit monitor, Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, reports and grassland management information, and it is now more important than ever.  The use of this information by 12,000 farmers participating in discussion groups and potentially 28,000 other farmers in one-to-one consultation is an enormous competitive advantage for Ireland, as other countries do not have this.<\/p><p> Teagasc in its education programmes provides ICT skills training which is guided by stakeholders who participate in the Teagasc education forum.  The Internet provides students with access to information, specific services and interaction with other students through social media.  Students are required to use the Internet to access and record general and more specific information for their farm and so benefit from the demonstration of adding value to data.<\/p><p> Teagasc has integrated the use of basic entry level ICT tasks into its training programmes for all its courses.  These involve the use of and engagement with online databases such as the ICBF database and e-profit monitor for technical and financial benchmarking, as well as various simple spreadsheets for recording, financial planning, grass budgeting and so on.  In most instances tasks that would have been previously carried out by paper and calculator are now done electronically and students are exposed to the basics of computer use for their own farm.  The use of farm software packages for training of students was always problematic.  However, all students are expected to use the reports for colleges and other farms for the relevant enterprises.<\/p><p> For more than four decades computer models and decision support tools have been advocated for guiding farm management.  The focus was initially for research but subsequently it was directed to farm advice, which was mostly financial, as well as animal and feeding management.  In early years their adoption was modest but in recent years there has been a greater uptake with advances in communication technologies.<\/p><p> The use of a bank of accurate information from trusted farms that are statistically representative of a population is a key development for research.  The use of data recorders in the field has been replaced partly by the capacity to tap into farmers' data with their permission and use these in research.  A good example of this is the use that ICBF make of data collected through the national breeding database which is used by farmers.  Teagasc has been involved in the development of a range of models, such as the  Moorepark dairy system model, the Grange beef model, Pasturebase Ireland and so forth, as well as decision support tools such as the mastitis cost calculator, grass calculator and milk payment tool and so on.  In recent years these have been used in research, advisory and education activities.  It is internationally accepted that the development of these ICT tools will be critical in the adoption of key technologies at farm level.<\/p><p> In the future it can be anticipated that ICT tools will play a much greater role in the adoption of key technologies at farm level.  Farmers should be free to choose the best solution or combination of solutions to suit their individual requirements.  To drive efficiency, the industry and Teagasc require access to high quality farm performance data, which enables sensible decision making on priority areas for industry development as well as enabling discussion around individual farm benchmarking and cross-farm comparison.  In the modern world this means getting data into web-based databases as efficiently as possible.  It is important that Teagasc is allowed to develop these technologies further to increase the competitiveness of Irish agriculture.<\/p><p> Teagasc has an obligation to provide the best research, advisory and education services to Irish agriculture and the application of modern ICT is critical in achieving this obligation.  That is in line with Government policy.  Teagasc has a long history in the development of ICT software applications to be used in Irish agriculture, and farm computing is moving from stand-alone computer packages to web-based databases, which is enabling data sharing and informed decision making through tools like the Teagasc e-profit monitor.<\/p><p> Teagasc has in the past and will in the future collaborate with commercial software companies in the development of their software and facilitate the development of interfaces to our software.<\/p> <p>Teagasc, like any other organisation, provides services to a large client base and should be able to use the best products to deliver our service in an efficient manner.  Again, this is in line with Government policy.  It is critical that industry good databases are managed, validated and secured by industry good organisations for the maximum benefit of Irish farmers.  I thank the committee for its time and interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300003#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350998100,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kelly and I invite Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan, chief executive officer of the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300005#F00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350998100,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation.  I welcome the opportunity to provide some information to the committee on the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, and its role in the agriculture industry.  I shall briefly provide information on the functions of ICBF and how technology is used by the organisation.<\/p><p>  ICBF was established in 1998 as a non-profit industry good and non-State body.  It followed many years of discussion around how the Irish cattle breeding industry might be better organised to remove duplication and increase the rate of genetic gain in our cattle.  It is a unique organisation, with its shareholders combining the farm organisations of the IFA and ICMSA, milk recording organisations and artificial insemination organisations - many of which originated from the traditional dairy co-operative structure - along with the dairy and beef breed associations.  Thus it is owned, one way or another, by farmers.  It provides services, directly and indirectly to all farmers in Ireland.  It is a genuine example of the potential of a co-operative type infrastructure when operated to its full capability.<\/p><p>  ICBF created a database to provide the information needed for effective cattle breeding decisions at all levels in the industry.  The most difficult aspect of any database is establishing a timely flow of clean, accurate and comprehensive data.  One of the key features of the ICBF database infrastructure is the removal of duplication in data collection.  For example, in 1998, a dairy farmer involved in milk recording and herd-book registrations would have to communicate on five occasions about a single calving event.  By 2002, with the introduction of ICBF animal events, only one notification of that event was required to satisfy all cattle breeding requirements.  The measure has saved costs, increased data accuracy, increased farmer participation and made cattle breeding information more relevant and valuable to all Irish farmers.<\/p><p>  ICBF has an annual budget in the region of &euro;5 million.  In broad terms, our income comes in the form of a tag contribution from farmers, which accounts for 20%, a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine operating grant, which accounts for 20% and which covers the cost of activities the ICBF took over from the Department, service income, which is about 40%, and the national development plan capital grant, which accounts for the remaining 20%.  ICBF provides employment to 35 people and is based in rural west Cork.  It also provides a contract for a further 35 people in the provision of weight recording and linear scoring services throughout rural Ireland.<\/p><p>  I shall outline the functions of ICBF.  First, it generates genetic evaluations or breeding values for animals based on the ancestry and performance data available nationally and internationally.  It is licensed by the Department to generate national genetic evaluations.  Genetic evaluations can identify breeding lines that give more output for meat, as an example, and for the same level of inputs such as feed.  The outcome of the process is a breeding index for an animal expressed in euro which farmers can use to make breeding decisions.  All 80,000 breeding herds nationally benefit from these evaluations.<\/p><p>  Second, to facilitate the generation of genetic evaluations, ICBF collects animal performance data from a wide variety of sources, including calf registration and animal movement data in conjunction with the Department's systems, artificial insemination data, milk recording data, slaughter data, mart data, DNA or genomic data, health data in the form of laboratory results and on-farm data, and on-farm performance data, which will become increasingly important as the focus switches to cost of production profit traits.<\/p><p>  Third, ICBF plays a central role in beef and dairy breeding schemes.  These schemes identify the sires that will deliver a maximum genetic gain to the commercial herds.  It will ensure the next generation of livestock are more profitable than the previous generation.<\/p><p>  Fourth, the ICBF engages with cattle breeders across the country, directly and indirectly, delivering breeding information so that farmers can make profitable breeding decisions at the farm level.  This happens in the following number of ways.  Bull proofs are made available to the breeding organisations, such as artificial insemination companies, through a publicly available bull search which has more than one million searches per year; HerdPlus, ICBF's breeding information service, provides farmers with a mixture of paper based and web based tools for making informed breeding decisions; and the ICBF engages with stakeholders to increase awareness of the value of using breeding information to increase profitability at farm level.<\/p><p>  The ICBF is not in the software business.  It generates and distributes breeding information that farmers can use to make profitable breeding decisions.  It communicates that information using a variety of technologies, but the bulk of engagement with farmers is still via paper.  The need to communicate using the Internet is also critical, and in this day and age it is a basic requirement for any organisation.  One of the key challenges for the ICBF is to get the wider farming population to engage with the breeding information and realise it has a key role to play in securing the long-term sustainability of farming.<\/p><p>  The ICBF's ability to operate efficiently and effectively depends on its ability to utilise technology to its maximum in the capture of data, the calculation of breeding values through genetic evaluations, and the dissemination of the resultant information to commercial farmers for use in their day-to-day breeding decisions.  The ICBF has always worked constructively with the farm management software providers.  The backbone of their business was traditionally made up of three elements: electronic calf registration, the electronic herd register, and electronic premium-subsidy management.  The ICBF is not involved in any of these areas.<\/p><p>  The ICBF provides a start-up file that makes it easier for the software providers to get clients on board.  We also provide an ongoing integrated transfer mechanism that allows data from the on-farm software systems to interact with data from a wide variety of sources captured through the national ICBF database.  Thus, ICBF has in fact helped the farm management software providers to grow their business over the years.  It continues to implement a policy of data sharing and integration.<\/p><p>  Many countries are envious of the national resource which is the ICBF infrastructure.  This was made clear at the 2012 International Committee for Animal Recording, ICAR, conference in Cork, which attracted in excess of 500 delegates from more than 50 countries.  Other countries are grappling with the inefficiencies associated with not having a national industry-owned cattle breeding database operated on a not-for-profit basis.  For example, in New Zealand there is significant turmoil and an inability to generate official national genomic evaluations due to the main database not being industry-owned and operated.  In the US, various organisations are working together to get a collaboration agreement in place to allow the consolidation of data for genetic evaluation purposes.  Ireland has a system in place.  In the UK there is no level of integration at a national level in terms of cattle breeding data despite repeated attempts to establish such a structure.<\/p><p>  The ICBF is an organisation that caters for the needs of all breeders in Ireland, small and large.  It is at the core of the suckler cow welfare scheme which has played a key role over the past five years in sustaining the smaller, less profitable beef farms in the north and west.  All those farms would have received technical reports from the ICBF, helping to identify areas which can be focused on to improve profitability.  The ICBF plays a role in ensuring the traditional family farm can remain sustainable in the future.<\/p><p>  The ICBF database is facilitating a significant amount of all-island research on the breeding end and in our work with Animal Health Ireland, AHI.  The AHI uses the ICBF database as the backbone for the roll-out of its programmes.  The ICBF has played a key role in the bovine disease eradication scheme which will be rolled out to all 80,000 breeding herds in 2013.  This maximises the return on investment the State has made through various governments since 1998.<\/p><p>  The ICBF has worked closely with Teagasc since its inception and collaboration continues to provide a huge benefit to the agri-industry in Ireland.  It ensures a maximum synergy of resources.  Advisers are in a position to give better quality advice in a more efficient and effective manner than would be possible without the link-up.  This is especially so in the area of discussion groups that provide a forum for farms of all sizes to participate in a learning environment with peers to help sustain their businesses.  Likewise, the ICBF relies heavily on Teagasc to get the better breeding message to farmers.<\/p><p>  The ICBF is helping to lead the smart economy with regard to agriculture and delivers real economic benefits at the level of family farms of all sizes throughout the country.  In 2009, Ireland was the first country in Europe and the second in the world to deliver genomic evaluations to its farmers.  The ICBF, along with the breeding industry stakeholders, has played a key role in delivering more than &euro;600 million of genetic gain to the Irish agri-industry since 2002.  The work the ICBF does also plays a key role in helping to deliver the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 programme.  The ICBF, along with the wider industry, has a key role in securing the ongoing viability of family farms in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300005#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1350998100,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coughlan and call Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300005#F00400","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1350998100,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from Teagasc and the ICBF for coming here and giving two excellent and informative presentations.

When a company such as the ICBF carries out the work, the efficiencies and economies of scale cannot be compared with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is an effective and efficient service, dealing with 80,000 herds with only 70 employees.  That says a lot about it.  Well done.<\/p><p>  With regard to the work of Teagasc, which is critical to the future of the agricultural sector, the courses throughout the country show agriculture is the new area to be in.  A few years ago, it was the construction sector and now it is the agriculture and agrifood industries.  The ICT area is very important for the transformation to the new range of technology.  If young farmers are to be attracted to the industry, the learning they must undertake is critical.  Although many Teagasc courses are full, is there potential to develop additional courses and to examine refresher courses for existing farmers and those who may not want to go back to college full-time but who may want to improve their ICT and e-mail skills in order that they can deal with the Department using the Internet rather than snail mail?  Mr. Coughlan mentioned that most communication with farmers is by letter, which is inefficient and costly.  If there is a way to become more efficient, it is through e-mail.  If one talks to a farmer of a certain age, however, the last thing he wants to talk about is a computer course or an ICT course.  This should be examined.<\/p><p>  The suckler cow welfare scheme, which Mr. Coughlan mentioned, was launched in 2008.

Resources continue to be a challenge and the ICBF must respond to increasing demands in trying to fulfil its role in Food Harvest 2020.  The Department, along with the wider industry, has been very supportive over the years in helping us, but resources continue to be an issue.  We have more and more demands and we run a lean organisation.  Nevertheless, the calls on us are increasing.  Genomic evaluation and cattle breeding technologies are exploding and it is a significant challenge to keep up with it.  However, it is important to keep up if we are to deliver on our role in the 2020 Food Harvest targets.<\/p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the suckler cow welfare scheme.  From the ICBF perspective, the scheme has provided the backbone of our ability to push on from a beef breeding point of view.  The slides in my presentation show that the trends in genetic gain on the dairy and beef sides are remarkably different.  We have not had the same progress on the beef side as on the dairy side.  The suckler cow welfare scheme has been the engine allowing us to get that in place.

At that time we had a major increase in the number of herds involved in cattle breeding, increasing from a few thousand herds to 15,000 dairy herds.  The sire recorded animals in the cattle breeding database is 13 million to 14 million.  We have a database of animals with ancestry, which is key for genetic gain, and we have the phenotypic records which cover milk, beef, female fertility and all the traits of economic importance.  That has allowed us, together with Teagasc and its research team, in particular Dr. Pat Dillon's group, to generate genomic evaluations.  Genomic evaluations are generated through taking the DNA of known animal sires, looking at their progeny evaluations and correlating them with the identification of genes of most value to develop predictions in order that one can subsequently genotype any animal and get a genomic evaluation.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Coughlan alluded, we were the second country in the world to produce genomic evaluations in 2009.

I am talking about the suckler farmer who has 15 cows and is reliant on every one of those cows to have a calving every year.

The key challenge is getting that message out to the smaller farmers because sometimes they are a little slower to engage or they have other enterprises to try to supplement their farming income.  The suckler cow welfare scheme allows all the suckler farmers, small and large, to engage, and that gives us communication with what, on the beef side, are mostly smaller farms.  Genomics will start coming in on the beef side and that message will be key.  The challenge is to get that message out to farmers through working closely with our colleagues in Teagasc, which has the extensification system, and engaging with the industry, whether at marts, meat factories, through Teagasc advisers, in the Irish Farmers' Journal or whatever.  The technology is available to the smaller farmers.  The challenge is to get that message out, and we are committed to doing what we can to achieve it.  The key point is that the genetic gain is on a profit per animal basis.  If this year's animal is &euro;20 more profitable, the real benefit to the national economy will be by ensuring all 2 million animals born every year are &euro;20 more profitable, which will give us &euro;40 million.

One of the big advantages of HerdPlus and the triangular relationship between Teagasc, farmers and the ICBF is that, even if a farmer has very little understanding of what these indices, measures and reports mean, the Teagasc adviser who will advise the farmer has access to the information, with the farmer's permission.  As I stated in my presentation, it is a major step forward for a national extension service such as ourselves to be able to add value to the existing information.  The day has gone when advisers went out to preach practice to farmers.

The key point is to remove this perception that HerdPlus is a piece of software.  HerdPlus is a package of breeding information relating to any given farmer's herd.  It benchmarks that information, perhaps within a discussion group or nationally.  Farmers engaging with HerdPlus means they are engaging with a combination of paper and web-based tools to assist them in making breeding decisions.  The information we communicate to the farmers is the key point, whether by web or by paper means.  These are just different mechanisms of communication.  Engagement with HerdPlus is an ongoing process throughout the year.  For example, when a dairy or beef farmer goes to a discussion group meeting and the discussion group facilitator uses a discussion group report which contains breeding information, that farmer is engaging with HerdPlus and with the information.  It does not matter whether the information is delivered on paper, by the web or by text message.  The focus of ICBF and HerdPlus is on breeding information.<\/p><p>  On Deputy Deering's second question about competition or collaboration or otherwise within the sector, I will ask our chairman, Mr. John O'Sullivan, who is a dairy farmer, to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300008#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350999900,"counter":603,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Deering's question, I may best answer it by describing my experience over the years.  Our family milks a herd of dairy cows just north of Cork city.  We have a big emphasis on breeding because we are members of the Irish Holstein Friesian Association.  At the time of the advent of ICBF, along with our national obligation to register the birth of every calf with the Department, as members of the herd book we had to register the birth of every calf with the breed society herd book which is located in Rickmansworth in Herefordshire in England.  The association has 3,000 members and we were sending a registration fee of &pound;10, as it was at the time, for up to 100,000 calves.  This money was going over to Rickmansworth.  Everyone engaged in that exercise was employed in the UK.  With the advent of the database, we saw an opportunity to bring home this business and to have our own herd book in this country to provide services to our members.  I was the chairman of the association at the time.  We employed just one liaison officer to work with the 3,000 members and to solve any issues arising between the Irish breeder and the organisation in the UK.  As a result, we left the UK parent organisation in 2002.  We bought our own office in Clonakilty.  The organisation now employs 13 full-time employees.  The charge is &euro;13 per registration.  At this stage this is considerably less than the &pound;10 we were sending to the UK at the time.  That &euro;13 per registration stays here in Ireland.  The 13 full-time employees are not ICBF employees but without the benefit of the integrated database, our organisation would not be in a position to support having a herd book here.<\/p><p>  Similarly, we are involved in breeding and it is essential to measure the performance of our animals.  The milk is recorded monthly.  A milk recorder comes from our milk recording organisation, takes a milk sample and a print-out from the on-farm computer for the amount of milk from the individual cow.  The big advantage from the point of view of the milk recording organisation is that the information collected by the recorder and the resultant analysis of the milk sample is entered in the database which calculates the up-to-date milk yields and constituents for each individual animal.  I receive that report electronically from the database to my Kingswood herd programme.  That information is then retained on the Kingswood programme on my farm computer on my desk and is instantly accessible.<\/p><p>  We calve a lot of cows in the autumn because we supply the liquid milk business.  We have to make decisions with regard to which animals to use on our cows in three weeks' time, for example, when we start the insemination programme.  A big advantage of the ICBF database is that it provides access to bulls from all over the world who have been progeny tested in Ireland, the UK, the United States, New Zealand and Czechoslovakia, for example.  I can key in the name of a bull on the database.  With ICBF's involvement with an international organisation called Interbull, I can have information on how that bull's progeny could be expected to perform in Ireland.  I can then make an immediate direct comparison between the performance of that bull and any other bull I am thinking of using.<\/p><p>  I had the responsibility of doing the paperwork for the pedigree animals on our farm since I was 14 years of age.  The difference between how it was done when I was 14 to how it is done now is unimaginable.  I go to different parts of the world because of my interest in cattle breeding.  No matter where I go, there is no system anywhere else around the world that can compare with what we have here.  As a farmer I am very proud of the fact that our organisation, the Holstein Friesian Association, put a substantial sum of money as a shareholding into this organisation.  My dairy co-operative is a shareholder.  I am a member of the IFA and it put money into it.  We farmers are really proud of this organisation which we have financed and set up.  It is delivering for farmers.  We get a very small percentage of our annual budget from the Government to do work that was previously government work and which would cost multiples of our costs if it were still government work.  <\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Deering's question about competition, I answer by saying there is no competition but rather there is co-operation and significant efficiency and benefits delivered to all of us as dairy farmers.  As chairman of this organisation, I know I can say this organisation is delivering enormously for farmers.  If anything were to happen to jeopardise the work of this organisation, there would be a lot of disaffection among farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1350999900,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their attendance.  I work with Teagasc on tillage and I concur that its work ethic and approach is very professional.  Farmers are only now beginning to come to terms with using a web-based as opposed to a hands-on approach.  Farmers love the interactive approach in general.  I was not surprised when a web-based sales programme did not work because I know farmers like to rub cattle and to look at them.  That is the farming tradition although it may not always remain so.  A two-tier system exists.  People like myself remember when computers were not in use but we have embraced them and there are others who will not bother with them.  We need to ensure the great work done by ICBF has a beginner's guide for users because some people are just starting out with the system.<\/p> <p>Our guests must be flexible and move with them.<\/p><p> I have no difficulty with large farms.  In fact, I am all in favour of them.  We must, for many reasons, protect large farmers.  In the first instance, these individuals are very exposed.  I have farmed extensively in my time and I am aware that issues arise in the context of land fragmentation, access to finance and land, variable weather conditions, land quality, availability of supports and so on.  There is a great deal to consider for those who own large farms and if they get wrong any of the matters to which I refer, they will end up going out of business.  This is because they can be exposed to such a large degree.<\/p><p> We may need to consider taking a more long-term approach, particularly in the context of educating students from second level onwards.  I am not stating an intensive course should be put in place, but there is a need for students to be aware of the importance of agriculture.  It should not be a revelation for them when they reach their 20s.  Students must be made aware of what is happening.  Mobile phone applications are huge and being embraced by the young.  Cork Institute of Technology is the first third level institution to offer a degree in cloud computing.  This is of interest to everyone, including farmers.  We need to ensure young people are exposed to agriculture early in order that their creative knowledge can be harnessed.  It would be great to have people involved in farming who also have an aptitude for computers.  It is these individuals who will ensure computer programming follows in the direction in which our guests are moving.<\/p><p> When I entered the biochemistry department in UCC in 1987, PCR was only just coming into vogue.  Those involved in the area were only evaluating the genome at the time.  As our guests indicated, the Internet only began to have an impact in the early 2000s.  It took these two major things which we now take for granted to come together to make the work to which our guests refer possible.  It is only 2012, which shows how matters have developed in a short period.  One of our guests referred to the massive changes that had occurred during his lifetime.  He is absolutely correct in that regard.  However, the pace of change has really quickened in the past 15 years.  The challenge we face lies in looking forward to the next ten years and deciding the direction we wish to take.  It is incumbent on Teagasc and others to begin putting a ten year plan in place.  They must be brave and bold in this regard and replicate what was done in respect of Food Harvest 2020.  They must ask what they want to see happening with their databases and so on in the future.  Our guests may only have aspirations now, but they can be damn sure that there is some bright young person out there who will make them become a reality.<\/p><p> I cannot praise our guests enough in this matter, particularly as this is the direction in which farming is moving.  People refer to small and large farmers.  Smaller farmers know their properties like the backs of their hands and can be completely accurate when they use their fertiliser spreaders in particular fields.  Consider the position of a farmer who owns 1,000 acres and may never have seen some of his or her fields before.  A GPS system will ensure he or she can achieve the same accuracy as his or her smaller counterpart.  What we are seeking to do is encourage attention to detail.  If they continue to be supported, Teagasc's and the ICBF's programmes will ensure large-scale micromanagement will continue.  If small farmers want to become large farmers, there is nothing wrong with this.  We must ensure, however, that courses are provided in order that they might become involved.  Some small farmers are very clever in matters such as those to which I refer and they have more time on their hands than their larger counterparts.  I would not always equate being a small farmer with not being tuned in.<\/p><p> We should not be recording data just for the sake of doing so.  A metric or performance-driven approach should apply.  It is great that, as our guests have indicated, the approach in this matter is led by farmers.  If that remains the case, it will be successful.  I have used certain agricultural machines and after an hour I was able to state they were designed by farmers.  However, I have used others which most certainly were not designed by them.  That was because they were not practical in their layouts and their displays were not ergonomic, among other things.<\/p><p> Our guests must realise this is only the beginning.  I will be interested in seeing how matters develop in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300008#J00400","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351000500,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I thank both of our guests for their presentations.

Our green cert or level 5 and 6 FETAC approved courses are guided by an education forum, on which there is farmer representation but, as I recall, no direct ICBF representation.  We have significant content in the programmes, particularly the green cert programmes, in terms of the use of the reports generated through the ICBF and in terms of breeding.  Reflecting Deputy Barry's comments, we consider this to be at the cutting edge of breeding and of genetic improvement and it is also at the cutting edge of important farm management information and the use of it by farmers to make better decisions.  We justify it on that basis.<\/p><p>  On Senator Pat O'Neill's question on student numbers and student intake, we have succeeded in having a take up of in excess of 1,500 new students across all our colleges and local option courses this year.

We realise we are struggling to keep up with the requirement.  I do not believe 300 people were left out of the loop this year in terms of training options.  We probably would have reduced that to somewhat fewer than 50.  Our obligation is to try to fit those in if they want to take up a part-time or online course during the year.  If not, we try to prioritise them and get them into a course in a college starting next September if that is their wish.  We have achieved in terms of  the intakes into the colleges.  We have around 140 additional places in our colleges this year, which was a major help when we came to address what looked like being a 300 or so deficit at the start of the year.

Some people consider this difficulty is a private matter and they do not want it to be known, but if Teagasc was to introduce a helpline that would be helpful because this is an issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300010#L01100","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351001100,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I will make a few general points and deal with some of the points that were raised.  I clarify that I wear a few hats and there were some jokes shared about that before I came into the meeting.  I also chair the Teagasc beef stakeholder group in Grange because I am passionate about the industry.  I spent four years at a national livestock chairman in the IFA.  During that time I would have fought very hard for the ICBF, Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make more facilities available to farmers to free up the amount of time they spend inputting data into various different elements and to get the data back to farmers in a manner that would help them  farm level.  A number of Deputies and Senators raised the issue of data.  The data originates on farms in the first place in that it is a farmer who inputs it.  Therefore, it is farmers' data and I strongly believe they have an entitlement to get the best use out of it and it should be got back to them in a manner that is useful to them.<\/p><p>  Originally I would have put a lot of pressure on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding agfood, the registration of calves online, and the herd register.  From the outset my view on the herd register, with which some people would differ, is that it was only been used as a means to penalise if they had an inspection at farm level.  That was the only use I could see being made of it.  My recollection was that we were promised at the start that when the national database was up and running correctly there would be no need for the herd register at farm level, the blue book that was being filled in.  Many farmers would have got packages on the farm to deal with the herd register element at the start, but many people could not afford it or were not computer literate.  We have got to the stage now where farmers can register calves and notify their movements on line.  They can do it on a smartphone, they do not need to do it on a computer.  The herd register is available online to farmers.  It is a matter of moving with the times and that development is helpful.  <\/p><p>  Access to agfood has been great from a farmer's point of view and it has removed some of the paperwork that was involved.  It has been a major saving to the Department.  With every calf that is registered online there is less of a manual input required by the Department and less postage involved.  The same applies to the suckler cow welfare scheme, which was raised by a number of members.  There is a difference of approximately &euro;10 in the cost of administering that scheme online as against through the paper format  <\/p> <p>It was set up initially to benefit the farmer but the knock-on effect is the genetic evaluations that have been possible because of the information coming through the system as a result of the suckler cow welfare scheme.  As a farmer I urge the members to apply as much pressure as possible for the maintaining of that scheme, the five year period for which is due to expire at the end of the year.  In terms of the benefit of that scheme, especially in regard to Food Harvest 2020, from a beef perspective we must see that data continue to roll out.  It is crucial that we try to capture that data in the future without losing the benefits we have seen.<\/p><p> From a Teagasc point of view, I can sometimes be critical of Teagasc from the point of view that there is not more work done with students on the area of technology.  It has been raised here also.  In terms of grass measuring, Teagasc pioneered that, at least from an Irish point of view, and put the package together, including the profit monitor and so on, but I take one or two students every year and it amazes me that some of them are good at it and want to take it on.  That is why I welcomed Deputy Barry's point on a ten-year plan.  We should ensure that every student that comes through the system is at least computer literate and that by the time they leave the agriculture college they are able to use the technologies available.  Do we want to go back to the time of the analogue phone in the office?  Mobile phones have evolved into smartphones.  Technology is allowing us to drive forward and to become more sustainable and focused as farmers.  It is crucial for us to examine how we can move that technology on to be of further benefit to us as farmers and identify the areas where there are deficits that we could look to improve.<\/p><p> The BTAP programme for beef farmers started this year and one of the conditions of that was people had to sign up and become a member of HerdPlus.  I support making it compulsory for farmers who were in the BTAP programme to be signed up to HerdPlus for a number of reasons.  First, there is an adviser, whether it is a Teagasc adviser or a private planner, who deals with it and, second, the amount of information available for a particular farm because all this information is in a computer.  All HerdPlus does is put it together to give that data back out to allow people make decisions on it.<\/p><p> The first year I joined HerdPlus I got a report stating I had a calving interval of 424 days.  I rubbished it because I also have an on-farm package.  I told HerdPlus that could not be the case because my herd was far better than that.  The second year I got it HerdPlus said I had a 421-day calving interval.  On further analysing it with a Teagasc adviser I realised I was rolling cows over, so to speak, from the spring to the autumn calving and from autumn calving to spring calving.  This year I managed to get it down to 372 days.  That is an extra calf for every seven or eight cows on the farm as a result of that one piece of information becoming available.  We need to get more from the information we put in on registering calves.  That is the only bit of information a farmer puts in.  The rest comes from factories, marts and various other elements.  We must see what more information we can get to help us, first, reach our Food Harvest 2020 targets and, second, to determine if we can exceed those because there is a growing demand for food and we should examine how we can drive that on further, and from a technology point of view also.  <\/p><p> Those are the points I wanted to make.  I have looked at a number of websites and many other people are making packages available free of charge be it the Irish Farmers' Association through its i-Farm or the Irish Farmers' Journal.  Many people are putting cash flow planners and various things on websites.  Those tools are available to farmers.  The more penetration we can get of that, the more advances we can make as farmers in the industry as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300010#L01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Doran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351001700,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I forgot to ask this question of Mr. Coughlan.

Nobody argues about the value of gathering the information.  I am a client of Teagasc, registered with the ICBF and a client of one of the companies and therefore I must be careful about what I say here but I understand how the system works.<\/p><p>  Dr. Kelly said that the DairyMIS survey was a development of what would now be considered a crude version of software but it was probably more challenging at the time than much of what has come through now.  In terms of finding through collaboration and a sharing of effort the most cost efficient way of gathering information and developing software product the question for Teagasc in particular, where I would imagine resources are tight, is whether there is a more cost-effective way of doing that in collaboration with some of the private software development companies which cover a multitude of types of software development, not just agri-software.  There are software builders who can do it, and Teagasc has had to outsource some of its roles.  Is it more cost-effective for it to do that?  Would it put pressure on its budgets to do it?  That is the general context of some of the concerns raised here on the previous occasion and it is only fair, in order to have a full discussion, that this point is raised.

On the tillage front some of our bigger tillage farmers have signed up with a non-Irish company which has an excellent tillage product.  It is very suitable for large tillage farms and their advisers have no hesitation in advising farmers to use farm software where they can demonstrate the need for and value of it.<\/p><p>  We do not want to be tied to a particular software.  Dr. Dillon might comment on that because some of the criticisms made against us is that we should not exclude software companies in, say, the development of a new national database for a particular area in the same way the ICBF has done for breeding, whether that is for grass, soils and so on where we have existing databases.

It is a question of developing a database to select cultivars that offer high performance under Irish systems, taking into consideration soil type, location quality and persistence.  It is critical for the industry to put a purely economic value on this as there are big gains to be made.  I am very positive after the discussion some days ago.  We need to drive on.

Let me give one example.  With Teagasc, we are currently establishing a next-generation dairy herd.  Mr. Dillon and his team have 200 animals with an average EBI figure of 210, the highest in the country.  This herd is important as a national resource because it is ten years ahead of the average.  As from next year, when those cows calve down, all of the relevant data thereon will be collected.  All the really important economic traits that dairy farmers cannot record routinely will be collected, including data that are difficult to record, such as the incidence of mastitis and lameness, live weights, greenhouse gases and efficiency.  With our genetic indices, we need to have the correct data collected and imported into economy-related and profitability indices that will take the industry in the right direction.  The last thing we want is to return here in some years only to say we are not making the predicted genetic gain at all because we forgot to measure two or three traits that will have proven to be more important than originally envisaged.  This was the case with fertility for many years.<\/p><p>  We are working with Teagasc in the context of our ten-year plan.  We will also be working in this regard in the beef industry.  The key is that new data will be identified that dairy and beef farmers will have to record in the future.  We will need to include the data in international databases to generate genetic evaluations and management reports for the industry.  With regard to our getting caught up in the discussion on how the data should be entered into the database and who should have what role, I agree entirely with Dr. Kelly that we must avoid precluding ourselves from encountering constraints or otherwise in this area.  This is because if something results in a stopping of work on the fundamental material, one effectively stops the industry from growing and driving profitability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2012102300012#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Cromie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351002300,"counter":634,"content":"<p>My understanding is that the proceedings today are being communicated via a live webcast.

The Chairman already introduced my colleagues so there is no need to repeat that.<\/p><p>  We have been asked to outline Enterprise Ireland's proposals for the new micro enterprise and small business unit and to draw reference to the proposed liaison with the local authorities on how this unit will assist micro enterprises in Ireland.  Before I take the committee through our presentation, it is important to say that the Government decision to establish local enterprise offices throughout the country, replacing the county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, is being brought forward by an implementation working group, which is chaired by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and includes members of all the key stakeholders.  These include county and city enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland, the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This group has been charged with reporting back to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, by December and has been tasked with overseeing the practical implementation of the Government decision on the restructuring of the existing micro and small enterprise support structures with a view to creating an enhanced national enterprise support model.  <\/p><p>  The overriding objective of our work is to build on the already excellent work undertaken by the county and city enterprise boards and to bring to bear the input of the local authorities in developing an enhanced micro enterprise support system.  The committee will also appreciate that the implementation working group is engaged in reviewing a range of issues and decisions on key aspects of the implementation process have yet to be made.  A number of sub-groups are working through elements of the implementation process and these include functions and structures; service level agreements, which will underpin the relationship between Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices; evaluation and approval procedures; and human resources.<\/p><p>  I will now take the committee through some of the key points of the statement.  I will preface my comments on the micro enterprise and small business unit by setting its activities in the context of Enterprise Ireland's overall objective on behalf of the State.  Above all else, Enterprise Ireland's objective is to develop capability to generate sales and exports and to grow jobs in Irish companies, which is critical for sustaining the economy.  In short, our job is to help companies create jobs.  Enterprise Ireland client companies employ, on a full-time basis, over 141,000 people throughout the economy, supporting direct and indirect employment which is estimated to total more than 300,000 jobs.<\/p><p>  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact that Enterprise Ireland client companies have a similar economic impact in the country to foreign-owned companies here both in terms of the number of jobs supported and also the estimated &euro;19 billion in annual expenditure in the economy.  The sales, particularly the &euro;15.2 billion in exports achieved in 2011, that sustain this level of local impact have to be won day in, day out by our client companies throughout the world.  Our job in Enterprise Ireland is to focus on all the elements of what a business or an entrepreneur needs in order to export successfully and create jobs.  More than 8,000 jobs were created by our client companies last year.  A similar number of jobs were, unfortunately, lost, mainly as a result of the continuing contraction of sectors such as construction and related business activity.  However, it is critical that the severe losses of previous years have now been stemmed.  <\/p><p>  This year has focused on encouraging investment and supporting our client companies in a move to a growth path.  In the first nine months of 2012, a total of 5,408 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, were secured.  Additionally, in the last two weeks, the Kerry Group announced the establishment of an industry-leading global technology and innovation centre in Ireland.  This &euro;100 million investment will create 800 jobs over the next four years, as well as 400 jobs in the construction phase, which will be part-funded by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation through Enterprise Ireland.  This adds to a number of significant announcements by indigenous companies over the past months, such as Dawn Meats and  EirGen  in Waterford, Shay Murtagh Precast in Westmeath, GenCell in Limerick, Technopath in Tipperary, Danone in Wexford and Cork, Copperfasten in Galway, Sysnet in Dublin and Eishtec in Waterford.<\/p><p>  A major aspect of our work is supporting indigenous start-ups each year and this is closely linked to the development of new sectors and clusters of job creation in the economy.  In the first six months of the year, 53 new innovative high potential start-up, HPSU, companies were supported by Enterprise Ireland.  Together, they plan to create over 900 new jobs by the end of 2014.  Both the number of investments and the number of jobs to be created are significantly up on the same period last year.   Over the past ten years, Enterprise Ireland has supported and invested approximately 800 high potential start-ups, which now generate approximately &euro;1.5 billion in sales per annum, of which 75% is exported.  These companies have directly created 12,000 jobs and account for a similar number of indirect jobs in the economy.  I would suggest that a quiet revolution has been taking place within indigenous industry over the past number of years.  Our efforts over the course of this year are likely to see us support the greatest number of high potential start-up companies ever supported by Enterprise Ireland in one year.  We have supported a total of 80 HPSUs against a target of 95 for the year and, in addition, we will have supported a further 60 emerging start-up companies under the competitive start fund, which is building a pipeline of companies in the economy which will help create sustainable jobs into the future.<\/p><p>  Underlying this end product of start-up companies support is a system of action which supports entrepreneurs in their efforts to set up internationally focused, innovative companies.  This includes the development of an effective and sustainable seed and venture capital system in Ireland, which provides the necessary finance for these companies, in addition to other supports aimed at increasing the availability of finance such as business angels and working with investors here and abroad. The provision of support through the community enterprise centres, CECs, in every county as well as incubation space across Ireland is often forgotten about.  Enterprise Ireland has invested substantially in CECs.<\/p> <p>This year, we approved further support for the business development managers within 37 of those centres.  These people are or should be the beacons of entrepreneurship in their communities.  The incubation centres in the institutes of technology and universities are providing a support environment for approximately 300 companies employing over 1,300 people.  We undertake a range of workshops, seminars and training programmes for entrepreneurs.  These are designed to aid the development of their business programmes and plans and assist them in the process of getting their companies off the ground.  The significant efforts of our high-potential start-up division seek to identify entrepreneurs and offer advice and assistance in the very difficult early-stage start-up phase.  Ongoing support and engagement with the CEBs throughout the country is also a feature.<\/p><p> Enterprise Ireland has worked very closely with the CEBs.  They are an important part of the State apparatus to support entrepreneurs and help to drive the creation of jobs throughout the economy.  In recent years, this has involved having a responsibility for the central co-ordination of the CEBs through our CEB co-ordination unit in Enterprise Ireland.  The unit is based in Shannon, and my colleague, Mr. Richard Murphy, is responsible for it.<\/p><p> It is clear that the CEBs have an excellent track record in developing and promoting entrepreneurship and enterprise in their respective areas.  The challenge, of course, is to maximise that impact and activity and to ensure consistency in the delivery of services.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, the Government made a decision earlier this year to enhance the micro-enterprise and small business support system.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, recently set out his vision for the reform of small business supports which will deliver a better and improved service to enterprise.  Micro-businesses and small businesses are crucial to our economy.  Ensuring that they can start, expand and export comprises a key pillar of our plan for jobs and growth.  This is why a part of the action plan for jobs commits to improving the support service for small businesses.  It is crucial that we see these reforms through in a way that delivers improved services for the businesses that need them.<\/p><p> The local enterprise offices, LEOs, will deliver access to micro-business supports, such as: finance, marketing, mentoring and management development; a progression pathway for ambitious companies from LEOs to Enterprise Ireland; local business advisory services, including regulatory, licensing and planning services; advice on accessing local procurement processes; access to commercial and enterprise space; access to promotional space; and local networking programmes and initiatives to support early-stage companies.<br \/><b><\/b>Microfinance Ireland, MFI, is a real example of the latter.  Applications to MFI are to be made with the support of the CEBs.  The CEB network and MFI are working on a service level agreement to underpin the CEB role, which role will continue into the LEOs.<\/p><p> The Minister has outlined the key elements of the Government's plan to bring forward the establishment of the new LEOs.  These include dissolving the 35 CEBs and transferring their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland.  This will be underpinned in primary legislation.  Another element includes delivering an enhanced service to the sector through the LEOs, which process will be underpinned by a robust service level agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities.  The plan is to ring-fence the CEB staff to retain their expertise, enterprise culture, skills set and capability.  This is vital.  The Minister is to retain responsibility for enterprise policy and budgets.<\/p><p> The Minister said that, by working together, the new LEOs will deliver improved and expanded services to small industry but will also provide more direct insight for local authorities and county managers into the needs of small business.  It is Enterprise Ireland's objective to have the Minister's vision of an enhanced, more consistent and coherent set of enterprise supports for small business delivered through the LEOs.<\/p><p> The work of the CEBs and the co-ordination unit in Enterprise Ireland must continue as normal during the planning phase of the implementation of the Government's decision.  It is crucial that entrepreneurs and client companies remain the primary focus of all the agencies.<\/p><p> The design and rolling out of the small business unit is currently under development as part of the work of the implementation working group.  However, it is fair to state the objective of the unit will be to lead, develop and manage the enhancement of a support system that generates innovative export-focused enterprises that will result in sustainable employment.<\/p><p>  With regard to the local enterprise offices, the unit will have responsibility for the potential exporters unit and Enterprise Ireland's regional office network, which also provides supports to client companies throughout the country.<\/p><p> With regard to the areas of corporate governance, compliance and stakeholder management, let me refer to the key pillars associated with the centre of excellence that is to be established.  The system will be underpinned by a service level agreement.  The agreement will be very clearly dictated by metrics which will include: the number of start-ups supported - financial and non-financial; the number of jobs created and sustained; the economic impact locally, which will be defined in terms of increased sales, exports, employment and economic expenditure; progression pathways, with reference to the number of clients that progress and are transferred to Enterprise Ireland; the number of entrepreneurial promotional activities undertaken at local level, in respect of which we have an ideal opportunity to promote entrepreneurship at all levels locally; the number of micro-financed loan applications assisted; and a range of local authority service-associated metrics.  There will be promotion of client development through the development of the pathways between the LEOs and Enterprise Ireland, and the progression of LEO clients to and from our high-potential start-up division, the potential exporter division or our established departments within Enterprise Ireland.  This is a core measure and will be part of the performance indicators.<\/p><p> With regard to knowledge, competence, collaboration and the transfer, there is a wealth of knowledge, competency and resources within Enterprise Ireland and across the LEO network.  An objective will be to increase the development, promotion and evaluation of a best-practice enterprise system.  The unit will also assist with national event management, including the national enterprise awards scheme, and facilitate and support the LEOs in organising the delivery of the national enterprise education programme, including the national student enterprise awards.  The unit will also facilitate the development of sectoral and regional networks and clusters, which will involve client companies from the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the CEB, to develop businesses opportunities such as sub-supply to the multinationals by micro-enterprise.<\/p><p> With regard to online support, we would draw on material and best practice from around the world in establishing the centre of excellence for micro-businesses and small businesses.  Based on the experience of our potential exporters unit to date, we have developed a customer-friendly interactive benchmarking tool, which has already been used by over 700 client companies.  This will enable all inquirers and start-ups to gain access to basic information, such as signposting, how-to guides and where-to guides for the development of their businesses.<\/p><p> The priority is now to work through the implementation process and ensure the best-practice support system for micro-enterprise can be put in place.  This will undoubtedly require the best efforts of all the stakeholders in this new approach, including the existing CEB network, the local authorities and Enterprise Ireland.  It is clear that a real opportunity exists to expand and improve the range of services available to micro-enterprise in a single, accessible local support office.<\/p><p> On behalf of my colleagues, I thank the committee for inviting us.  We will be happy to respond to any questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350996000,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hayes for the good breakdown of the procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300004#C00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1350996000,"counter":648,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.  Enterprise Ireland does fantastic work.  I had the honour of travelling abroad with it to see the work it does there in addition to the work it does locally.  I commend it on the initiative launched yesterday for female entrepreneurs.  It is a niche that needs to be developed, and the initiative is a good start in that regard.<\/p><p>  I am not convinced that the association between Enterprise Ireland, county enterprise boards and, in particular, local authorities, is good.  It has the look of a shotgun marriage.<\/p> <p>While respecting the work Enterprise Ireland does, the enterprise boards have fulfilled a niche for companies that have been established since 1993 that were never Enterprise Ireland companies.  Much of the language used in Mr. Hayes's presentation suggests they are still not on Enterprise Ireland's map.  He spoke about export-focused microenterprises.  Many enterprises which fulfil a local demand or service got their start under the county enterprise boards and while they may grow and eventually develop an export niche in their start-up phase, these enterprises did not do that.  When the local authority is brought into the mix and one thinks of small business and business efficiency, one does not think of a local authority.  They do not get it.  They do not understand the pressure under which small businesses operate.  I am not convinced this new model will be of better service to businesses seeking information and start-up support.<\/p><p> I understand the implementation working group is to report to the Minister by December.  Does Mr. Hayes have an understanding of the timeline following that?  I ask that in the context of budget negotiations for 2013.  Where is the budget that traditionally would have been part of the county enterprise boards due to go in 2013?  Will it remain within the enterprise boards or will it go to Enterprise Ireland?<\/p><p> On the section on service level management, Mr. Hayes said that Enterprise Ireland will allocate individual budgets to LEOs based on agreed funding guidelines.  Will he expand on what that involves?  Are they agreed or what kind of guidelines has Enterprise Ireland in place?  Mr. Hayes mentioned that part of the input to that will be a range of local authority services associated metrics.  That is a new term.  I believe members would be interested in getting some detail on that.<\/p><p> Mr. Hayes said that regarding client pathway development, &quot;there will be promotion of client development through the development of the pathway between the LEOs and Enterprise Ireland&quot;.  That is welcome but my key concern, and this was mentioned by Mr. Hayes, is the progression of LEO clients through the HPSU, the potential exporter division or established departments within Enterprise Ireland.  Where within the Enterprise Ireland is the home for the traditional county enterprise board client?  Is there a welcome for them or an understanding of their particular needs as we move forward?  Where do the Leader partnerships, especially the Leader enterprise funds, fit into this?  Will they come under the remit of the LEO or what experience has Enterprise Ireland of dealing with those?<\/p><p> There is considerable reference to service level agreements and the detail of them in the presentation.  Who is responsible for supervising those?  Is there an independent arbitration mechanism in place that can be accessed by a client company or a business which feels it is missing out or is there just going to be a cosy-up between the local authority and Enterprise Ireland for the sake of it to show that Enterprise Ireland is being tough on the local authority and <i>vice versa<\/i>?  Is there a robustness to the system or an independent mechanism in place in that respect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300004#C00300","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350996600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Mr. Hayes will answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300005#D00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350996600,"counter":651,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked a number of questions.  I will deal with his last question on the service level agreement first.  The service level agreement will be drawn up between Enterprise Ireland and each local authority and it will set out the broad parameters of the work we expect to be carried out based on a budget which will be provided to each LEO.  Much of the work they will undertake will continue in line with the work they are currently undertaking such as promoting entrepreneurship locally, helping a small business locally, and providing a range of supports in terms of management development and training.  We are in the process of drawing up the service level agreement and it is very early days.  It is part of the work of the implementation working group, and a broad draft of that will be available in the next few weeks.<\/p><p>  The budgets for the CEBs will be subject to the same budgetary arrangements as those that apply to any Department or to Enterprise Ireland.  We will go through that process in the next few weeks.  I expect the budgets that will be allocated will be largely preserved under measure one, measure two and the administrative support that is provided to the city and county enterprise boards.  The legislation is likely to be ready in the first quarter of next year.  It is primary legislation and work on it will depend on other priorities, but the drafting of it will take some time.  It will probably be the second quarter of next year at the earliest before it is fully operational.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland officials sit on the evaluation and approvals committee of all the city and county enterprise boards.  Therefore, we are well aware of companies and individuals that are coming through and the small companies that are likely to be in a position to progress to Enterprise Ireland.  While the initial priming support is provided through the city and county enterprise boards, we are quite aware of those with the potential to grow.  If there is a more appropriate and suitable product or service that can be provided to Enterprise Ireland, these are fast-tracked into Enterprise Ireland.  Our potential exporters unit is operating throughout the country and 400 companies have attended the various exploring workshops at which we encourage more local companies to export as that is where they can secure growth.  A number of CEB clients have attended those and are now attending the so-called get export ready workshop, which is a follow on to that.  There is a reasonable progression trend in place for clients to come from the city and county enterprise boards into Enterprise Ireland.  Some have gone on to become high potential start-up companies.<\/p><p>  On the so-called one to many approach, in terms of support, Enterprise Ireland has largely dealt with companies that have a staff of more than ten and the potential to export.  Our focus has been very much on exporting.  That is the world we have inhabited.  In terms of a new model, we will have to be one to many, as it were, rather than one to few.  A typical development adviser in Enterprise Ireland will have a cohort of companies that he or she will get to know quite well in terms of their business, priorities, management team, marketing priorities and financial arrangements.  For the smaller cohort of companies, the types of companies to which the Deputy referred, that would be reliant to a large extent on the domestic market, our centre of excellence unit will develop supports and information that will be available to all those.<\/p><p>  For example, in respect of our get export ready model, we examined models around the world as to what constitutes best practice and what other countries do.  We should examine what other countries do and learn from that.  We now have a benchmarking tool.  It would be worthwhile to go onto Enterprise Ireland's website and check the get export ready option, which goes through a number of steps, including whether a firm is ready, whether it has prepared, whether it has the necessary funding, whether its product is right for the market, what kind of distribution channels it needs in that market and what the competition is doing.  There is a checklist under that option.  We need to develop something similar for small businesses in order that they would be able to do a self-assessment check which would signpost them in the right direction.  Such a checklist would include whether they need a mentor, whether they need some further developmental support and whether they have sufficient resources.  That kind of a checklist will also be developed under the centre of excellence unit.  In the six months we have been operating with potential exporters, we have found that most of the work is done over weekends.  These are busy people trying to do business and win sales during the week and then they can access this tool at the weekend.  I expect something similar will be developed for very early stage clients and start-up businesses as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1350996600,"counter":652,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na hoifigigh a th&aacute;inig isteach agus a rinne cur i l&aacute;thair an-suimi&uacute;il.  It is important when we talk about these issues that we contrast the position with what we are up against.  We are in the midst of probably the worst enterprise and jobs environment this State has experienced in 50 to 70 years.  For all the good that Enterprise Ireland has managed to do during the past year, there has been a net increase of six jobs with regard to Enterprise Ireland companies.<\/p> <p>This shows the stark challenge faced by Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p> The pace of reform in the microenterprise area is quite shocking in that the former Minister, Batt O'Keeffe, raised the change in county enterprise boards a considerable number of years ago but it still is ongoing.  I was shocked to hear the planning stage will extend until December and legislation is not anticipated until the next quarter of next year.  A representative from the Irish Exporters Association who appeared before the joint committee stated that at present, because of the state of not knowing, there was inertia within county enterprise boards that was having a serious effect.  Consequently, over the past three or four years, a time when small businesses and enterprises actually have needed the most support, there has been this inertia in this particular segment.  Members would like to see this reform up and running as soon as possible and this is extremely important.  One issue mentioned by Mr. Hayes concerned the make-up of the implementation group.  Does the implementation group include representatives of SMEs or of SME representative organisations because that is key to good development of that area?  Sinn F&eacute;in has a major problem with the plans.  The party considers the fit between Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards to be quite good even though Enterprise Ireland's regional delivery has been uneven in the party's experience.  We believe this could have created difficulty in respect of county enterprise boards in local areas.  However, the fit with the local authorities is a wrong fit.  The culture of local authorities is not pro-enterprise and in many areas, local authorities are the enemies of small business in the context of their associated costs and procedures.  I always think it is akin to three Irish people going to an Australian city, in that it will be the Irish accents and not that of the Australian city that will change.  Similarly, in the case of three of four people from an enterprise agency going to a local authority, it is unlikely their enterprise culture will alter massively the local authority culture.  The reality is the local authority culture may alter that of the enterprise agency to the negative.  This is one of Sinn F&eacute;in's major problems in this regard.<\/p><p> I refer to some of the information provided by Mr. Hayes, who mentioned the number of planned jobs high-potential start-up units sought to create.  Typically, what is the ratio between planned and actual jobs from high-potential start-ups?  What is the failure rate of high-potential start-ups?  What is Enterprise Ireland's experience with the credit famine being experienced by businesses and the agency at present?  In addition, I refer to a measure that should be developed in this context.  Many small to medium enterprises are really stuffed in respect of the local market and export markets therefore are necessary.  I have been involved in enterprise development for approximately seven years and one measure I saw that really worked was a programme called Operation Shamrock, in which small businesses in local areas were hand-held into the target market.  In other words, an enterprise agency would select five or six really good local enterprises within a county, for example.  The agency would identify the target market in the export market and would warm that target market for the companies concerned.  It would then set up the meetings, hand-hold them over to the sales meetings and perhaps even chair the sales meetings until the aforementioned small businesses got their first export experience under their belts.  This was a major plus in the way it was developed.  Perhaps Mr. Hayes will answer some of these questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300005#D00400","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350997200,"counter":654,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

I am just coming back to it because the figures for this year thus far, which I have provided, are much higher.  I had the good fortune to work overseas for a number of years on behalf of Irish companies entering the market.  I assure members that business must be won and re-won all day and every day.  Regardless of whether someone wins a contract today to supply a major multiple or a systems integrator or a major telecommunications company, such business must be re-won day in, day out through innovating one's product, through research and development, further sales and marketing and through further investment.  Consequently, the 140,000 dependent jobs and the other 300,000 indirect jobs must be fought for all day every day.  Back in 2011, when competing against companies right around the globe, that was a major challenge.  This year, as I noted, we have seen an increase in that regard.  More companies are undertaking research and development this year than was the case last year.  More companies are undertaking job expansion programmes this year than last year and more companies are undertaking management development programmes.  These all are signs that companies are in a position to at least grow and develop and hopefully this will continue over the next number of years.<\/p><p>  As for the local authorities, the Government has made a decision in this regard.  Part of that decision refers to the one-stop shop and part of it refers to education.  I addressed a conference of county and city managers last Friday, at which one county manager made a presentation.  I detected therein that they are learning and that an education is under way.  While there is an education and a learning to be undertaken by them, they recognise that and this probably is the beginning of a process that already has commenced.  In respect of the jobs, I mentioned Enterprise Ireland's high-potential start-up division.  This pertains to high-potential start-ups only and does not include our established cohort of client companies.  However, over the past ten to 12 years, there have been 12,000 direct jobs.  Moreover, these are really sustainable jobs because they are in areas such as biotechnology, the life sciences, the Internet, gaming and telecommunication companies.  We have some superb companies supplying to global players in the telecommunications sector, many of which would not be well-known names.  However, such companies exist and employ 30, 40, 50 or in one case, almost 800 people.  The latter company won the entrepreneur of the year award last year and is planning to take the initial public offering, IPO, route.  Many such companies are working away and the jobs fallout therefrom is very low.  As for the failure rate, it is quite modest among such companies.  While I do not know the precise percentage, it is very small.  The main reason for this is Enterprise Ireland invests taxpayers' money and consequently, we ensure a real and significant level of due diligence is undertaken on each project in which we invest.  We consider it from the perspectives of the market opportunity, the technology - we will not have any firm coming through that lacks the proper technology - and the financial and the commercial viability of the project, because our money always must be matched by funds coming in from the private sector.  We will carry out a due diligence process in this regard and many of the entrepreneurs thank us for so doing, because they realise they have been through a fairly rigorous process in respect of assessing a project and usually are much stronger and better in consequence.  Such companies usually survive and many of them now are in the process of going through an accelerated growth programme because we also try to pick winners.  We try to support companies that will add value, create the jobs and hopefully will go on to become large-scaling companies into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1350997200,"counter":657,"content":"<p>What about the export programmes and the necessity to hand-hold?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300006#E00500","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350997200,"counter":658,"content":"<p>On the hand-holding exercise, exports really are where Ireland must go over the next number of years.

I have been working with Enterprise Ireland in a different capacity over the years.  I have always found it gave everything and I know everyone in it works very hard.  In particular, I compliment it on its offices abroad and the work it does abroad.  Recently, I went on a parliamentary trip to Australia where we met people from Enterprise Ireland.  If I ever get an opportunity to speak to the Minister, I will encourage him to increase those 28 offices to about 48 because it would be fantastic if we had more of them around the world, especially where we are trying to get into new markets.<\/p><p>  I do not have a problem with failure.  Where there are entrepreneurs, there is risk and there will be failure.  The attitude in the US is completely different from the attitude here and we need to open up to that.  Most people who fail in business once will go on to succeed the next time or the time after that.  I would like to see far more turnover going into Enterprise Ireland than words about how many succeeded and failed because where there is failure, success usually follows.<\/p><p>  I am a bit concerned about some of the language we are using in connection with the report and LEOs.  Again, much of it is linked to exports.  My view of the LEO is that it was aimed at getting people started so I am a bit concerned about that.  There seems to be a mess in respect of the one-stop shop.  I thought that when the LEOs went into local authorities, they would use more of a one-stop shop approach.  If a business needed planning or support, everyone could work together.  The LEOs have been challenged by a lack of funding and considerable administrative costs over the past eight or nine years.  In particular, the funding has not been increased in the past four or five years.  My understanding was that when they were subsumed into local authorities, there would be streamlining where there was duplication of work and there would be better outcomes and efficiency as a result.  Again, that does not seem to be in the report but perhaps that is part of the implementation process.  Those are my concerns.<\/p><p>  My greatest concern is that I have not seen anything in the report about relationship managers meeting businesses locally.  Most businesses are usually small, employing one to three people.  They are trying to manage sales and deal with the bank, procurement and everything.  They do not have the time to look at all the websites or go through all the stuff Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities offer.  If we are to grasp the opportunity that exists in Ireland and globally, we must put people on the ground to help others get through this process.  Again, the clustering is fantastic and there many opportunities.  All the multinationals, of which there are 600, are more than happy to help small companies get off the ground, but for some reason we do not seem able to create the pathway for that to work smoothly.  The only way we can do that is to have people on the ground, which would be my one big ask.  Otherwise, it will just be changing the name of what is in place.  The reason we are changing it is because it is not working to its optimum level and we need it to work at this level in the challenging times we face.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300007#F00400","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350997800,"counter":663,"content":"<p>The Deputy quite rightly mentioned the area of failure and I fully support her ideas on this.

We need to spread that culture a bit more.<\/p><p>  I will take on board the Deputy's views on people on the ground.

One of the areas on which I wanted to focus was regional development and regional disparities in respect of the work of Enterprise Ireland and this new unit, because we all want better outcomes.  The three issues I will raise are funding, networks and clusters and the concept of incubation centres.<\/p><p>  Mr. Hayes stated in his presentation that Enterprise Ireland will allocate individual budgets to the LEOs based on agreed funding guidelines.  He went on to talk about metrics which are all quite good in terms of the number of start-ups supported and the number of jobs created, but he did not deal with targeting resources where they are needed most in areas of high unemployment.  We know the Border counties and south east have very high levels of unemployment.  Mr. Hayes stated that jobs were created in EirGen, Eishtec and Dawn Meats in Waterford.  However, we know that unemployment in the south east is 5% above the national average and there are problems in the Border counties.  There is a need for a regional focus.<\/p><p>  The issue of networks and clusters is linked to that.  Again, Mr. Hayes stated that the unit will facilitate the development of sector and regional networks and clusters involving the clients of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the city and county enterprise boards.  That suggests it will facilitate the development of existing clusters.  I want Enterprise Ireland to look at directing the emergence of new clustering, where this is possible, in areas of high unemployment and not just focus on what exists at present.  One problem that could arise is that we could follow a pattern that has been set in respect of a lot of work that has been done but not look at whether we need to think outside the box and do things differently in respect of under-performing regions and areas.<\/p><p>  Mr. Hayes spoke about having incubation centres in each of the institutes of technology and universities and providing a supportive environment for approximately 300 companies and units in these centres employing in excess of 1,300 people.  There are areas that do not have third level institutions.  There are areas in the south east that do not have a university, so we need to ensure these incubation centres are linked to their nearest third and fourth level institution.  It is important for us to foster a culture of innovation, and the institutes of technology and universities can play a big part in that.  In the south east, the Telecommunications Software &amp;amp; Systems Group and the eco-labs work with existing companies.  We must ensure links exist and that we benefit from the innovation trade-offs that result from the links with the institutes of technology.  That means, however, that policy must fit and a joined-up approach must exist to ensure areas have the educational facilities to bring that about.  In the south east, there is the need for a university.<\/p><p>  My last point relates to job retention.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned the net increase of six jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies, and Mr. Hayes also mentioned that it is about retaining jobs.  Much work goes into keeping jobs, which is important.  Is there an idea about how we could do that better?  Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a proposal based on having a rapid response unit that could work with companies which have gone bust to see whether there are opportunities.<\/p> <p>We could give many examples.  Workers' co-operatives could be set up, for example.  Much more could be done in this regard.  Time is often wasted and opportunities are lost simply because there is no agency focusing on responding very rapidly to circumstances.  Could this be considered?  I refer to small businesses, even those with fewer than ten employees.  There is potential in this area for workers to take over some companies.  The point was made that contracts are won and re-won, but the point could also be made that companies are invented and reinvented.  They can be reinvented by employees if relevant supports are made available initially.  I ask the delegation for its views on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300007#F00600","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350998400,"counter":666,"content":"<p>If I miss out on many points I ask the Senator to revert to me.  I will respond to the last point first.  We do respond where there are closures or where there is what we euphemistically call downsizing.  This is usually in the case of larger companies.  I will not list any of the names.  Where there have been significant closures, we have worked with other Departments and the IDA to help to identify whether there are other projects of relevance.  As a consequence of some of the closures and downsizing, there have been some very good spin-off developments.  We have helped by way of feasibility practices but obviously the people in question know the businesses best.  There is a cry or clamour when a large company closes because of the number of jobs involved but the Senator makes a very valid point that we should consider the resurrection of very small companies.  Perhaps given the new circumstances associated with the local enterprise offices, we should pay more attention to this issue.  Every single job matters.<\/p><p>  With regard to fostering the culture, the Senator is absolutely correct.  All the international indicators point to Ireland being among the most entrepreneurial societies on earth.  The reality is that we hold up very well when benchmarked, and various international reports suggest we are very entrepreneurial.  The most recent GEM report suggests that, in the areas of medium to high technology, we are ahead of the EU and OECD averages.  This, in itself, indicates our position.  It is borne out by some of the figures I listed on high-potential start-ups.  These are significantly ahead of many of their European neighbours.<\/p><p>   A programme covering the new local enterprise offices, which we want enhanced, concerns secondary education.  The earlier that one inculcates the spirit of entrepreneurship, the better.  The programme for second level run by the county and city enterprise boards should be encouraged further.  Each county will have considerable opportunities in this regard.  The authorities can work with the local secondary schools, ICA, ICMSA, IFA or GAA.  They should be able to work with all concerned in local communities to encourage people to work for themselves and start businesses as opposed to just looking for work somewhere else.<\/p><p>  There is significant involvement in the area of funding research within third level colleges.  There are two programmes leading to some outstanding successes.  The first is the Think Outside the Box programme.  This year, there were over 350 applications north and south of the Border from teams of students in third level institutions.  We have encouraged the cross-fertilisation of ideas so people in sciences and engineering can work with people doing business.  The best teams involve the cross-fertilisation of functions.  We have been running this programme for a number of years.  Up to the past year or two, many students have seen it as a rite of passage, or another project.  The students would have gone to Australia or sought a job afterwards but they are now much more serious in that they are starting businesses.  Out of the ten finalists this year, six are beginning to commercialise their projects and one is in the pipeline as a high-potential start-up.  There are some excellent ideas.  There is much greater willingness to develop a business as opposed to just doing a project for the sake of doing it.<\/p><p>  The other programme is the New Frontiers programme under the enterprise platform programme, with which some of the members will be familiar.  The enterprise platform programme was largely educational and the entrepreneurial business development side was relatively modest.  We have completely reformulated the programme.  There are nine programmes on their way to the 13 IOTs.  The last to start is in the Carlow-Waterford region, and it incorporates 15 business ideas.  There will be 150 in total.  We hope that, after six months, 100 new businesses will start up as a consequence of the programme.  We have been very impressed with the quality of candidates.<\/p><p>  I was in Waterford Institute of Technology in recent weeks making a presentation.  We ensure that we espouse our views in the third level institutions and encourage students to start up businesses, undertake feasibility studies, participate in the New Frontiers programme or obtain a Think Outside the Box award.<\/p><p>  On regional development, every single region and county is important in terms of retaining and increasing the number of jobs.  Our remit is primarily associated with Ireland Inc., in which it is important to have jobs.  I often ask parents whether it would not be better to have their sons or daughters working in Galway, Dublin or Cork as opposed to Dubai, Sydney or Perth.  It is important that we consider the issue from a national perspective in the first instance.<\/p><p>  Last week was the week of the Dublin Web Summit.  The reality for the companies in question is that Dublin will be the primary focus of their investment because it has the appropriate ecosystem.  This does not in any way suggest we do not wish to support businesses throughout the country.  We have supported over 100 community enterprise centres, practically in every county.  This year, we supported 37 business development managers.  I will be addressing these managers next Friday as they will be coming to our office for a conference.  It is a question of trying to encourage them to develop their businesses locally.<\/p><p>  Our competitive feasibility scheme was targeted specifically at the regions.  We had a pilot programme in the south-east and received over 40 applications.  Yesterday, I received information from our manager in the west, where we had a similar programme in respect of which there were 46 applications from teams and individuals.  The applications were from Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim and Mayo. With regard to regional development, that is our fourth roll-out.  Our final programme will be rolled out in the midlands over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1350998400,"counter":667,"content":"<p>Consider the most recent figures received from Enterprise Ireland on grant aid.

I take the point that inputs and grant aid do not in themselves paint the full picture, but they do tell us something about the fact that, for whatever reason, some areas are not creating jobs and the spirit of entrepreneurship or output is not what it should be.  If we just follow the current pattern and do not determine why some areas are underperforming and what extra supports, resources and tools can be given to those areas, we are destined to make the same mistakes again.

Have we started to work on the potential for spin-off companies?  Mr. Hayes referred to the potential for cluster development in that location and the possibility of establishing an enterprise park.  When a major company comes into an area we should immediately target that area for spin-off companies, rather than wait for something to happen.<\/p><p>  I was a member of a county enterprise board and I am very much in favour of them.  They were able to target small start-up companies and people who had an interest in setting up their own businesses.  I am worried that we may lose the common touch of the county enterprise boards and their relationship with local people who want to start up small businesses.  Enterprise Ireland is focused on exports, as the witnesses have said several times.  Many small start-up businesses are focused on their locality and often on supplying the large enterprise developments we have been talking about, such as Kerry.  I am a little concerned about that.<\/p><p>  Could Mr. Richard Murphy tell us the timeframe for moving from county enterprise boards to local enterprise offices?  This question was asked but we did not get a clear answer.  Can we be sure local enterprise offices will be in place?  I am getting calls from staff of county enterprise boards asking what exactly is happening.  <\/p><p>  I am fearful of local enterprise offices being associated with county councils.  In 1997 or 1998, Kildare County Council set up a business park in Kilcullen.  Many people were interested in coming on board but because of the inefficiency and lack of experience of the individuals involved, only one company set up in the business park.  The rest of the park is lying idle.  County councils do not have experience in this area.  I am nervous of the future with regard to them.<\/p><p>  County enterprise boards are involved in many projects.  I am thinking of school entrepreneurships, for example.  In County Kildare, a small company set up by a young school pupil has gone international.  Many schools in County Kildare have become involved in this enterprise competition.  I would hate to see a programme like this being lost because funding to local enterprise offices was focused on setting up companies.  School pupils are the key people.  Secondary school pupils may even be too old.  If children are given the entrepreneurial roadmap at primary level, we will have a real chance of seeing them become entrepreneurs later on. <\/p><p>  Is there any cross training between Enterprise Ireland and county enterprise boards?  County enterprise boards run excellent training courses for people who start up businesses.  I hope that will continue and link with the experience of Enterprise Ireland which deals with companies at a different level, those with more than ten employees.  The work of Enterprise Ireland could be micro-managed down to a smaller level.    <\/p><p>  The joint committee is planning to put together a publication showing what is available to people who want to start up businesses.  Last Thursday evening, I knocked on a constituent's door and he asked me what was available in this regard.  He told me my own website had more information than he could get from Enterprise Ireland.  That is key.  When someone clicks onto a web page they want to know exactly what is available, what they are entitled to and what they can get.  Information should be made as simple as possible so that a small sheep farmer like myself can understand it.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300009#H00500","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1350999000,"counter":674,"content":"<p>There is nothing small about you, Deputy, either in stature or as a farmer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300009#H00600","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350999000,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Richard Murphy to address the questions on the timeframe and the county enterprise boards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300009#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350999000,"counter":676,"content":"<p>The replacement of county enterprise boards by local enterprise offices is working its way through an implementation group.

Under the current arrangement, Enterprise Ireland comes under the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the local authorities are under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I have a major issue with that.  Most of the current enterprise boards have been very successful, although an odd one or two have not been as satisfactory as others.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was in government and at parliamentary party meetings, members would raise concerns about which county enterprise board was not working.  I think the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation by its nature is not entrepreneurial and did not manage the strategy for the enterprise boards.  That is not taking from my personal belief in their success.<\/p><p>  I see a major struggle between both Departments.  Civil servants are great at fighting turf wars.  Many county managers are very autocratic people.  We would love to think that they are visionaries and leaders, and they are thinking of their country first.  How will the county managers co-operate?  Will there be consistency?  I doubt it.<\/p><p>  The question of staff has been raised.  In times of economic turmoil it is very wrong to change direction.  The major issue is to provide jobs for people.  Some 87,000 people emigrated last year.  Why would one make a political decision in a time of turmoil to change a system that works well?  Mr. Richard Murphy suggested that the staff will stay focused but I do not believe that staff are happy about this.  Their jobs are at stake.  There are 124 people employed in the county enterprise boards.  Human beings, by their nature, will worry about what will happen to their jobs.  Will there be promotional and career development opportunities for the staff when these changes have been made? <\/p><p>  It makes good copy to read of a robust service development agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities.  My experience as an entrepreneur and a politician leads me to ask what sanctions Enterprise Ireland will apply to a local enterprise office that is not delivering its applications for start-ups.  Who will deal with the offices if they do not reach their target?<\/p><p>  Has Enterprise Ireland the resources to handle all the queries that will arise from the change in the structure?  I agree with Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins who states there should be twice as many Enterprise Ireland offices around the world for the great work it does.  How many applications are processed by the city and county enterprise boards at present?  How many actually deliver?  In my experience one must bore down into the domestic market before one can dream of exporting.  How will Enterprise Ireland handle that?<\/p><p>  We had a delegation from the Irish Exporters Association before the committee about one month ago.  They were seriously concerned about potential exporting companies that were not getting help from Enterprise Ireland.  I was amazed to learn that as I thought that Enterprise Ireland had an open door policy.  I think Mr. Hayes should meet Mr. John Whelan, the chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, to find out about the hundreds of companies that cannot get official help to export their produce.  I think that is very important.<\/p> <p>I know that Mr. Murphy is the CEO and co-ordination person in Shannon, is that not right?  Mr. Hayes is also involved, so it is complicated.  What is his role in the micro-enterprise unit?  What new elements will the implementation group add to it?  I am not arguing with the witnesses but, in principle, I instinctively cannot support this move under the local authorities.  By its very nature it is not entrepreneurial enough.

If it continues not to achieve it, the view is that it will be tendered for private people to come in and deliver what the LEOs are not delivering.  However, that is looking at it from a negative perspective.  In fairness, it is best to give them the opportunity to see what they can do.

They may not understand the specifics of every single business but, nonetheless, there is a way to empathise and relate to a business person.  It is absolutely crucial that those skills are maintained.<\/p><p>  The Senator referred to the Irish Exporters' Association.  For some time, it has been said that there is a gap between the cohort of companies that Enterprise Ireland supports, which is in the region of 5,000, and a huge cohort of companies that are not being helped or supported in terms of exporting.  I know Mr. John Whelan quite well and while there may be some such companies, they are being catered for under two banners.  One is the launch of Going Global which is to attract service companies that were doing work on the domestic market but may never have thought of exporting a service.  One may genuinely ask how some services could be exported, but over the years companies involved in architectural services, quantity surveying, legal services and financial services have exported as a result of undertaking a feasibility study.  Through connections and partnerships with companies overseas, they are now in a position to export some such services.  That support service product is still there.  <\/p><p>  The potential exporters' service was established primarily to encourage, excite and energise a cohort of companies that was largely able to support itself through the boom years.  The cohort comprises companies involved in areas such as construction, service and manufacturing related to that sector.  We have already supported them, either through our online benchmarking tool, or on a one-to-one basis.  Today, we have an \"Exploring Exporting\" workshop in Tullamore.  We had one last week in Kilkenny.  We have had nine so far this year and will have another four before the end of the year.  As a result, we will have met individually with about 500 companies that are seeking to export.  That is a whole new effort to energise and re-energise.  It is open to any company, not just clients of Enterprise Ireland, but also to CEB clients or other companies, in any community that feel they have a product or service they wish to export.<\/p><p>  As Senator White well knows, exporting is not easy and one must first test out a product or service in the domestic market.  However, many companies do not have that luxury because the domestic market is so small in some areas that, almost from day one, they must consider exporting.  I am certainly happy to meet Mr. John Whelan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes"},{"type":"speech","time":1351000200,"counter":691,"content":"<p>That is why I said it to Mr. Hayes.

First, I want to congratulate Mr. Hayes and everyone else at Enterprise Ireland on their work in winning the Kerry investment.  I know that a lot of work went into that, specifically from his own section in Enterprise Ireland.  The team had to focus on that and it was not an easy win.

Mr. Hayes must also be complimented on the net gain in jobs.  I recall having the same discussion during the boom times with a different set of people from Enterprise Ireland.  Even at that time, it was seen as a success to have a net gain because there were many losses in certain sectors during the boom time.  It is a major credit to be still winning and have a net gain at the end of the day, rather than a net loss.  Mr. Hayes should keep up the good work on that.<\/p><p>  While concern has been expressed about the proposed new LEOs, there is also an opportunity here.  We all have such concerns because there is a perception among many business people about how local government works.  While that perception may be right in some cases, it is not always correct.  For example, some local authorities have improved a lot through their economic development units.  There is perhaps a chance to merge talents and develop this further.  I look on this as an opportunity to get it right, but it is important that we do get it right.  Although the people in enterprise boards have done an excellent job, it is important to retain the excellent staff involved.  It is not a major panic that they are moving to work under a new name, provided that we keep them and their skills.  Enterprise boards have done well by being driven by the people working in them.  Some enterprise boards have not done well because the people in them did not do so.  In the majority of cases, however, good people drove them.  I am confident that we will still have them working under a new heading and under the direction of Enterprise Ireland. which is the key.  There is a fear that this will be directed to the local authorities but it is quite clear to me that the LEOs will be directed by Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We have to keep that business drive and that message needs to get out.  There should be an opportunity here to address the concerns that people have with their perception of county councils.<\/p> <p>It usually relates to planning and enforcement matters and charges, albeit contribution levies more so than rates.  New businesses must be given a chance before forking out large amounts of money on contribution levies.  That obligation is unfair and blocks business.  I hope that the local enterprise offices, LEOs, will act as one-stop-shops, champion the issues affecting businesses and provide solutions when problems with local authorities arise.  Since the LEOs will be in the local authorities, there should be a greater opportunity to resolve planning issues at an early stage.<\/p><p> Many new businesses start in backyards, kitchens and garages.  They should not be hit by planning enforcement straight away.  We must work on this matter.  In 2008 or 2009, moves were afoot in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address it, but the environment changed.  LEOs have a chance to address the matter and work with everyone involved.  I hope that our guests take my point on board.<\/p><p> The presentation referred to how the LEOs will expand the range of services.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy will inform the committee of what the one-stop shops' new services will be.  I served on an enterprise board.  Such boards were restricted in their work by a limited set of criteria.  They could either work with manufacturing businesses or not work at all.  I hope that the new LEOs will be able to work with any business that has the potential to export or to create jobs locally.  There has always been a spatial issue, but every member present has seen opportunities to create jobs lost too often because that year's pot of money was gone or the businesses in question did not fit into a specific box.  A one-stop shop will ensure that no one with an idea is left adrift.<\/p><p> Our guests mentioned that there will be guidelines on financial allocations to each county.  If a county's money runs out, I hope that access to the central pot will remain.  There is nothing worse than being told in October that there will be no money to save or develop jobs until six months time.  That is not good enough in the current environment.  I hope that this will not occur after Enterprise Ireland becomes further involved in these units, particularly if there is money going unspent in other counties.  It is not good enough that jobs will be lost because of a lack of common sense.<\/p><p> A question mark remains over the role of Leader partnerships.  Perhaps our guests will address this issue in terms of supporting enterprise at the local level.  As there is often a crossover, clear direction as to who does what, and how, is necessary.<\/p><p> We are discussing start-ups and developing businesses.  Many people with new concepts or inventions are struggling to access finance to develop them.  The LEOs could have a role in this regard.  A person who does not want to start a business but who has an idea or invention is finding it difficult in the current climate to develop his or her work.  The responses from State bodies have not been good to date, as we are focusing on business development and job creation.  We must remember products and new ideas, particularly those of backyard inventors.<\/p><p> Exporting associations have concerns about export credit insurance.  When the committee raised this issue one and a half years ago, it was told that it was not a problem.  However, it remains a problem and we need to focus on it.  Enterprise Ireland might be better placed than most to address it, either today or at another time.  It is important that we get this matter right.<\/p><p> We hope that the LEOs will have a can-do approach instead of telling people to go somewhere else for help.  Anyone who walks through an LEO's door should be given a chance to develop his or her business idea.  I will stop asking questions.  It is key that LEOs work with local authorities to develop solutions instead of creating problems.  Sometimes, business people are concerned about walking through a local authority's door.  Often, this is merely a perception and we must do away with it.<\/p><p> Deputy Collins touched on my final point, namely, failure rates.  Enterprise boards are too cautious.  Enterprise Ireland can be the same, that is, results oriented and concerned with high success rates.  I become depressed when I see high success rates, as there should be failure rates if we are doing our jobs right.  If we are too cautious, we will miss out on potential job creation.  I grow nervous when people claim that they have great success rates.  We need to judge them on failure rates as well.<\/p><p> Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, Collins and Calleary will ask additional questions.  Our guests can address my comments while answering those.  As Deputy Lyons has not contributed yet, we will start with him.  I did not see him waving.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300011#K00900","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351000800,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I cannot underestimate Enterprise Ireland's work in maintaining or slightly increasing job levels.

The Workers Co-operative Network appeared before the committee a while ago.  It mentioned how successful co-operatives and that type of economic activity could be.  The model that we typically use to measure economic activity is foreign direct investment, FDI.<\/p><p>  The Workers Co-operative Network stated that in some countries, for example, France, legislation is in place to allow jobs and enterprise agencies to examine a company that is about to go down the drain to determine whether it is sufficiently viable to have life pumped into it.  Must we review our approach to companies that are going down the Swanee?  Is there a fresh way to determine whether they remain viable?  My impression is that there is.  Enterprise Ireland and other bodies, including the Legislature, need to ask themselves these questions.

In 2009, when the financial crisis arose and the economic scenario was at its worst, we introduced an enterprise stabilisation fund to help and support companies that were vulnerable but viable.  Owing to the banking crisis and the economic difficulties, these companies may well have gone out of business were it not for the support.  Between 600 and 700 companies were supported under that scheme.  Largely, we put preference share support into those companies.  We examined the companies' prospects, trading record and future prospects.  Within the past 48 hours I read an application from one of those companies seeking research and development support.  The company, which employs 47 people, might not be in business today were it not for support at that time.  That is the nearest to an emergency response.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned companies which are vulnerable but viable, but with support from us or from outside, they can be sustained and maintained.<\/p><p> I take Deputy Calleary's point on the SLA and the agreed funding.  We are working through that issue.  The implementation working group and the three subgroups are meeting on that issue and another meeting is planned for next week.  We will come back to the committee on what comprises the SLA as it is still at the early stages, but it will be worked through during the coming weeks.<\/p><p> We are conscious that the majority of companies have to test the product or business on the domestic market initially.  There is always a cohort of companies that think globally from day one.  In the telecommunications industry, it can have an application in China or the US almost from day one.  For most companies the home market is vital, whether it is a consumer product or a product that can be sold to international companies.  I refer to my own days overseas.  If someone came to me wanting to sell to a department or public utility in that territory, I would ask how that person got on in his or her home market, who had bought from him or her in Ireland, and if the Department or local public utility bought from him or her because, if not, it was going to be difficult for an exporting company to take on the products in foreign countries.  The home market will continue to be vital in terms of preparing companies and ensuring they have the necessary skills, management development, training and capability to grow and develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300012#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Hayes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351001400,"counter":703,"content":"<p>Are there any other comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300013#M00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1351001400,"counter":704,"content":"<p>May I have a response to the issue of potential?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300013#M00300","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351001400,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I apologise.

While I will mention them, because they reflect the concerns of our members and of the organisation, I will not labour them.  <\/p><p>  The Small Firms Association is the voice of small business.  We represent approximately 7,500 small companies that employ fewer than 50 people.  Since the establishment of county enterprise boards, in a similarly difficult economic climate in 1993, the network has contributed substantially to the development of start-up and  micro-enterprises in Ireland.  They gave direct assistance through their advice and finance but they have also paid a key role - this point has been made - in raising the profile of entrepreneurship throughout society, particularly through their schools programmes and in partnership with my organisation through the emerging ethnic entrepreneur programme.  This is a key issue.   <\/p><p>  County enterprise boards have also been successful in leveraging EU funding, in addition to Government funding, to expand their range of services which they have developed and expanded as the needs of business have grown since 1993.  They have been strong in developing relationships in local communities, across Government and through many of the other groups within the business community.  This allows them to tap into a vast quantity of expertise and knowledge which has been supportive of many of their clients.  In the current economic climate much of the advice and support they give is voluntary and free and can add to the business knowledge of many of their start-up clients.  Many members of my organisation who availed of their services attribute their success to the support they received from their county enterprise board, particularly in the early years of their business being established.   <\/p><p>  The Small Firms Association has always been supportive of the stand-alone county enterprise board structure and of their strong presence throughout the regions.  While we recognise that efficiencies could be made, and the recent oversight of Enterprise Ireland is welcome to give the boards a national coherence, we have concerns about the movement into local authorities.  One of the concerns, which has been mentioned already, is the poor relationship the small business community tends to have with local authorities.  Many view their local authority as a mere revenue collecting body.  <\/p><p>  The proposed structural change will be damaging to the enterprise agenda.  It is difficult to understand how such a small group will survive in such a large organisation whose main priority is revenue collecting and imposing on these businesses that they are now are deemed to support.<\/p><p>  We are also concerned that small businesses need state agencies to be honest brokers in giving them the best advice for their organisation.  If this advice is to be influenced by local authority employees this credibility may, over time, be lost.  Some of these individuals may turn into gatekeepers in terms of collecting rates, licence payments and so on.  This could be an issue for the support that should be there for the establishment of small businesses.   <\/p><p>  A key concern is that we will lose the valuable time, expertise and knowledge that business people so generously give to county enterprise boards.  There is a concern that by moving into local authorities the service may move away from its core market.  <\/p><p>  We must also talk about money.  Budgets will be overseen and viewed by Enterprise Ireland, but in a local authority struggling to meet its budget how can we be assured that enterprise funding will be red-circled so that a council cannot, at some time in the future, view it as funding that is more essential for other services?<\/p><p>  With regard to some points raised by Mr. Tom Hayes in the earlier session, the Small Firms Association is supportive of the online support services.  We have been saying for a long time that they should be there.  Equally, we believe the knowledge and competence collaboration of the sectoral regional networks will be beneficial when they are established and are up and running.  The development of greater supply chains can be beneficial for many small and medium enterprises, both in working together and in linking with some of the larger agencies and companies that they may, traditionally, not have been able to access so easily.<\/p><p>  Listening to Mr. Tom Hayes, we had concerns about other issues, which have been discussed already.  A member of the committee asked what is the associated metrics.  We would like clarification of that.  I was concerned by the mention of enhanced services.  Enterprise Ireland mentioned enhanced services being provided through the new structure, but all the services outlined in the presentation already exist.  It would be good to have clarification on that.<\/p><p>  Without labouring the point, there is huge concern at the focus being moved towards export and internationally focused businesses.  While we recognise that the focus has to be on creating sustainable employment and on adding value to the local and national economy, we must bear in mind that the county enterprise boards support all start-ups.  While many of these are businesses that will never export or trade internationally they will trade indigenously and are very important for their regions.  This mandate must be protected.  <\/p><p>  In line with the EU Small Business Act, we believe there must be a full impact assessment of the implementation of this Government decision.  This assessment must be conducted from the perspective of the small business community and small business user, rather than a Government Department.  We also have concerns about the implementation process to date.  While we understand it is ongoing, we are aware that there has been little or no involvement or focus on the end users and clients.  We are also unaware of any action or analysis done to date by these implementation groups on how the county enterprise board clients and end users feel about the new structure and what they would like to see coming out of the new system.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee for their attention.  I will be happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300014#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Avine McNally"},{"type":"speech","time":1351002000,"counter":744,"content":"<p>Thank you for attending, Mr. Fielding.

I represent the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, which represents small and medium businesses throughout the country.  We have 8,700 members.  I do not need to tell members of the committee about the global and national crisis we are in and I will not talk about the need to restore stability and reignite short-term economic activity.  We are here today to discuss micro-enterprise, the small business unit and its liaison with local authorities.<\/p><p>  We are talking about changing a structure but we still do not have a national policy on entrepreneurship.  That is a massive indictment of the current and previous Governments.  We must develop and adopt a national policy for entrepreneurship and small business development.  I am asking the committee to put such a proposal at the top of its agenda, and in doing so to think small first. <\/p> <p>Supports for entrepreneurs are of the utmost importance in encouraging new business start-ups, growing businesses to a sustainable level and making the transition to a global scale.  We talk in terms of three tiers: at the top level are the multinationals, foreign direct investment companies that have the backing of IDA Ireland, report to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and are doing an excellent job.  At the next level down are the medium and small businesses.  Again, they are within the remit of Enterprise Ireland and can avail of the support provided by its high potential start-up, HPSU, policy and export units which report to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  At the lowest level, the micro-business level, the real seedbed, is where all businesses start and obviously they need support.  They represent about 85% of all business entities in the country.  These businesses need advice and encouragement which they will get from local authorities under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Is that thinking small first?<\/p><p> The county enterprise boards and the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, share a birthday.  We left IBEC in 1993, the year the county enterprise boards were established.  They have played a significant role with very limited resources in the past 19 years.  They have promoted small and medium business development at local level throughout all parts of the country.  I will not say they have done an excellent job<font color=\"#222222\">, but they have done a good job.  ISME was a critic of them in the early part of this century.  In the first press release I issued in August 2001, I was having a go at them for being a little bit distant from their clients.  In recent years they have improved and remain the main contact point for support for so many micro-businesses.  The locally based county and city enterprise boards have assisted entrepreneurs with start-up capital and financial support in the form of loans which are almost unobtainable from our busted but bailed out banks.  They supply training support, as well as engendering a positive attitude to entrepreneurship in local communities.  We have seen attitudes to entrepreneurship improving greatly in the past ten years, but there are still significant gaps in the provision of start-up capital, market knowledge and ensuring the development of the appropriate entrepreneurial mindsets and business skills.  It is imperative that the level and quality of the service provided are maintained and improved.  The best model is the continuance of the county enterprise board ethos under the control and guidance of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, with a greater focus, better direction and greater cost control.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\"> Let me comment on the issue of public expenditure.  One of the promises of the Government after the McCarthy report was issued was to get rid of quangos as part of the strategy to curtail public expenditure.  Obviously, ISME would agree with this.  There is no need to have 35 sets of overheads, CEOs, finance officers and different offices, as the money spent could be used much more beneficially in assisting micro-enterprise businesses.  This is a perfect opportunity to put in place shared services.  Killing off 35 quangos might make a great soundbite, but it is not sound judgment if it is done without thinking through the consequences of a proper solution.  It is dangerous.  The way it is being portrayed and pushed could put the provision of entrepreneurship support back ten years.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\"> In the place of the dissolved county enterprise boards we will have a micro-enterprise service within local authorities that will work to establish a new network of local enterprise offices in each local authority.  The intention is that the county enterprise boards will migrate to this new structure.  That announcement has sparked concern and confusion among many micro-businesses that we support and represent.  There has been no mention of changes to the range of services county and city enterprise boards provide by way of business supports and the budget available to them.  There is very little detail on matters such as reporting responsibilities, levels of autonomy, advisory structure and staff levels.  We have not seen a cost benefit analysis or a savings breakdown.  The real challenge will be to avoid the county enterprise boards getting lost in the labyrinthine structures which will not be able to deliver quality services to clients and which will not be an efficient use of limited resources.  Is that thinking small first?  Most county enterprise boards are seen as doing a good job and the fear is that by making them part of a bigger entity, the intimacy of the local services they provide may be lost and decision-making will be slowed down.  Whatever happens, we will still need local assessment boards.  There is creeping inertia in the boards because this has been ongoing for a number of years.  Fears have also been expressed about undue administrative influence if the link between the new entities and the local authorities is too close and it will be close.  The new entities will be part of the local authorities, which is a danger.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\"> From the point of view of responsibilities and ethos, in one fell swoop the Government is interfering with the organisations that are actually making a difference to micro-businesses.  The county enterprise boards were always the first port of call for new entrants, where they received initial encouragement and support.  I would be very fearful about the boards operating under the wing of local authorities because local authorities have a job to do; they do not have the same ethos or experience of dealing with small business.  As I said, the move has the potential to set Irish entrepreneurship back and should be resisted.  We recognise that some unpalatable decisions will be made and that current structures cannot be immune from the requirement to achieve savings and the need for more innovative responses.  However, shoe horning the county enterprise boards in under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is wrong.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local <\/font>Government looks after the environment and has  responsibility for matters such as water charges, septic tanks and bogs.  It should stick to its knitting and look after the taps, toilets and turf.  The remit of the local authorities is to look after a long list of items; I will not bore members with the 26 listed in my presentation, but they include housing, estate management, roads, plant and machinery, water services, drainage, leaks, metering, planning, parks, museums, the heritage, libraries, rates assessment, rates collection and enforcement, just to name a few.  Now we will add business support and the encouragement of entrepreneurship to their remit.  We have a seedbed for small business in which these businesses are being nurtured by the county enterprise boards, yet we are going to take that structure and migrate it to an underground carpark in the local authorities.  We have plenty of big buildings around the country, the Taj Mahals being built by them, which is wrong.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation should look after and have responsibility for job creation, enterprise and innovation.  It seem ludicrous to strip away the seedbed for businesses from the relevant Department.<\/p><p> The issue of timing was mentioned.  The timing is all wrong because entrepreneurs, whether they be survivalists, nascent or budding entrepreneurs, need all the help they can get.  What we are doing is upsetting the infrastructure, the people, advisers and, or, management and starting mini turf wars where there is uncertainty.  There is always the danger of inertia happening.  We talk about the clients or customers of the county enterprise boards.  Changes to the county enterprise board network structure must keep the needs of clients at the core of deliberations.  In that context, a locally based flexible, client-focused system under the control of an enterprise service will undoubtedly have most merit.  Have the customers or clients being asked for their opinion?  The answer is &quot;No.&quot;  Even the customers' representative bodies have all voiced their opposition at the small business advisory group but we have been almost ignored.  The question was raised of how many small businesses <font color=\"#222222\">were represented on the implementation body.  The answer is none.  Mr. Hayes states the plans are in place and that ISME will be consulted.  The customers of the county enterprise boards, which are about to be changed, have not been consulted.  In fact, our displeasure has been ignored.<\/font><br \/><font color=\"#222222\"> There is also a difficulty with the bridge when a business customer of a county enterprise board, somebody with fewer than ten employees, grows to become a customer of Enterprise Ireland when he or she has more than ten employees.<\/font><\/p> <p>There is a difficulty in the transfer of the functions of CEBs to Enterprise Ireland, and while efforts are being made all the time to overcome that difficulty, imagine what will happen when not alone is there to be a transfer from the local enterprise office CEB to Enterprise Ireland, but responsibility for this is to transfer from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Department Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  All along, entrepreneurs are working in same businesses in the same sector and are confused because of the potential that this will happen.  That is not thinking small first.<\/p><p> All Departments need to be in unison in how they co-ordinate the delivery of sustainable growth and meaningful, long-lasting jobs.  A fragmented approach will not be conducive to long-term growth and job creation.  What the Government needs to consider is the creation of a clear, effective and holistic approach to sustainable job creation and growth.  We need to stop the turf wars, the in-fighting and the manoeuvrings between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p> In a nutshell, to encourage entrepreneurship and job creation in all Government and public sector initiatives, we must protect, defend and nurture micro-businesses from their set-up through to their growth and we have to streamline those services, not create obstacles, as is proposed in this move under local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We need to have a national policy of entrepreneurship and we need to think small first.  Putting the support services for micro-businesses under the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities is a wrong move.  It will stunt and delay growth and will set back entrepreneurship by decades.  I predict that if and when this happens, we will back here in a number of years to rectify this bad decision.  I thank the members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2012102300014#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Fielding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351003200,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Avine McNally and Mr. Mark Fielding for their contributions and I appreciate the frankness and directness of their comments.

Climate change is a big issue and I know it will feature strongly during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in 2013.  Therefore it is essential we are fully aware of all of the facts which need to be addressed in 2013.  We need to meet our 2020 obligations, but according to the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, interim report we need to move beyond a compliance approach and I welcome this positive attitude.  Ireland needs to be a world leader in this regard.  We need to be at the forefront of promoting clean technology, clean fuel and a clean environment and in this regard I would like the witnesses to comment on a specific issue.<\/p><p> One of the main contributing factors to greenhouse gases is the production of animal waste.  As an agricultural country we produce much of this as a by-product.  It is not easy to dispose of and it has serious pollution and health and safety hazard implications.  However, in its own right this by-product is a valuable resource as a ready source of almost pure methane.  Biomass is an alternative to fossil fuels and accordingly can make a valuable contribution to reducing our emissions and reducing the costs of importing fossil fuels.  However, it needs to be harnessed.  My question is why this is not being done.  Why are we not openly pursuing and discussing this?  Why have we not acclimatised our minds to this issue?  Throughout Europe there are examples of how it can be turned from an ugly problem into something which is very good in terms of emissions, environmental sustainability and sustainable jobs outside large urban centres.  Members of the committee are acquainted with very successful projects in other EU member states.  I ask the witnesses to refer to this in their address.  I call on Dr. O'Donnell to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300003#D00300","speaker":"996","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1350998100,"counter":788,"content":"<p>I think the Cathaoirleach.  The secretariat of the National Economic and Social Council is extremely grateful to the committee for the attention it is giving our work and for inviting us to discuss it today.  In late 2011, the secretariat of the NESC was asked by the Government to prepare two reports on climate change: an interim report on policy options which could close the gap to Ireland's non-emissions trading scheme, ETS, emissions in the compliance period to 2020, and a final report for the end of this year to develop the basis for the long-term transition to a low carbon economy incorporating the key messages of our first report.  These two papers will be part of the Government's programme or road map for the development of a national climate change policy and legislation.<\/p><p>  The work of the NESC secretariat over several decades has been to provide background analysis which frames the development of policy rather than making specific recommendations, which is primarily the work of Departments.  In addressing the framing of this issue, it is very striking the dominant framing of climate change has focused on seeking a binding global pact on targets and timetables; emissions trading as a central policy instrument; a particular model of the relationship between science and policy; and what we call an information deficit view of the many behavioural and attitudinal issues which everyone recognises are central.<\/p><p>  In embarking on this work our secretariat tended to share the assumptions which underpin this dominant set of ideas.  However, undertaking the work has forced us to think more critically about these elements.  This dominant approach has at times led to a highly dualist and divisive policy debate at international and national level and it has not achieved its central goal.  We believe, as we outline in the report, that a significant reframing of the climate change challenge is necessary and is already under way in international policy and thinking.  In identifying the pressures on the dominant framing we highlight the challenge which continually confronts the task of achieving global agreement.  We suggest we need to take a realistic and fairly hard-headed view of the ability of carbon pricing, emissions trading and existing technologies to address global warming.  We suggest organisational capability in firms and State organisations and the rule of consumer demand are often overlooked in the discussion on climate change which tends to reflect the emphasis in the discussion on the actions of states.  We suggest it is necessary to move beyond the information deficit view of behaviour change and get deeper into the practices and obstacles which can make it difficult or easy for households, firms, civil society organisations and public authorities to reduce their carbon production or carbon consumption.<\/p><p>  Our interim report also highlights the strengths and limits of the very heavy emphasis on targets and timetables which tends to dominate the politics and policy of climate change.  More than anything else perhaps, our interim report suggests the balance of attention needs to shift from how much emissions reduction to aim for to how to achieve decarbonisation.  Building on this framework our interim report contains detailed chapters on Ireland's existing policy, sectoral profiles and challenges in the areas of energy efficiency, transport, agriculture and land use, which relates to the question the Chairman asked, carbon tax and the possibility of purchasing credits.<\/p><p>  Drawing together our analysis of these various sectors and challenges we argue that in formulating a new climate change strategy Ireland needs to keep three precepts in view at the same time.  The first is economic prosperity.  Actions on carbon must be consistent with economic recovery, employment, fiscal correction and longer-term prosperity.  The second is decarbonisation.  The goal is gradual, permanent, widespread decarbonisation of the economy rather than compliance with specific targets and timetables.  The third is time.  Many of the actions, technologies and practices which can achieve decarbonisation take considerable time to make themselves felt.  This suggests Ireland is confronting very severe challenges and some opportunities.  In current conditions cost-effective actions for CO2 reductions on a predictable timescale in areas such as energy efficiency, transport, renewables and agriculture face significant constraints in policy design, human resources in the public system, public finance, the limited availability of credit in the private sector and the widespread deleveraging in the household and business sectors.  At the same time it is equally true that some of the measures, particularly energy efficiency measures, for addressing climate change can promote recovery and employment in the coming years.  Many of the measures we want to take mesh with long-term economic development.<\/p><p>  Overall we suggest a pragmatic approach with action on three tracks simultaneously.  Track one is to design and implement measures which makes sense and are feasible in the coming years on energy efficiency, taxation, transport and agriculture.  Track two, which we label \"explore and experiment\", is to use organisational networks to test and scale policy possibilities in a range of areas such as electrification of heating and transport, the smart grid, biomass, transport and agriculture.  This track reflects our finding that action on climate change usually occurs when the ball is given to an agency or organisation which has the ability to run with it.<\/p> <p>Examples include the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, in energy efficiency, the ESB in electric vehicles, Bord na M&oacute;na in biomass and many others.<\/p><p> The third track is strategic and institutional and is concerned with framing and developing Ireland's strategic approach in three areas.  First, what institutional design and process for policy analysis, policy decision and policy development is necessary?  In our final chapter we suggest that, in considering institutional issues, it is important to address a number of aspects, not all of which have received sufficient attention in the debates to date, for example, the need to achieve an effective combination of high level central government decision making with effective front-line action in the types of agency to which I have referred; the need to achieve a stronger link or links between Ireland's out-facing carbon accounting, in which we have established a reputation, and our in-facing government and societal project of addressing climate change and decarbonisation; and the challenge of finding an agenda combining green enterprise, employment recovery and green growth that motivates policy and political and societal actors rather than climate or emissions reductions alone.<\/p><p> Second is the challenge of framing Ireland's engagement with the EU.  This should include the purchase of credits internationally if that proves necessary.  Ireland must have a role as an advocate of reform of the EU climate policy process so that it might be richer in policy review and mutual learning.<\/p><p> Third, we are addressing a challenge in our second report for the end of this year, namely, finding an Irish logic and motivation for a low-carbon economy, including the possibility that Ireland could be a global leader in the agricultural and food aspects of climate change.<\/p><p> These three tracks are summarised in a short handout that we will supply to the committee.  It sets out our framework for considering the institutional challenge facing our system.  On this basis, we are happy to answer the committee's questions to the best of our abilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rory O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350998700,"counter":790,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Donnell for his presentation.

The ESB has been given a significantly entrepreneurial role in developing its capacity in terms of the softer technologies of charging, albeit not the motor vehicles themselves.  This type of development is a wise move for Ireland, in that it will have a limited role in the motor industry and that there will be a diffusion in time, albeit not within the target period.

I might connect the issue with the question on animal waste.  The solution to the latter can be somewhat similar, that is, entrepreneurial activity led by agencies to try to figure out what to do.  When one examines the economics, using animal waste to reduce emissions is more costly than other options within the agricultural sector.  This alone tends to knock it out of contention when one considers the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, carried out for us by Teagasc.  However, using animal waste is a good idea in terms of its impact on emissions, the environment, landfill and job creation potential, but we need to work with agencies to figure out how to do it in a cost effective way.  For example, the desk analysis implies the need for a centralised large anaerobic digestion plant.  It is interesting that companies such as Bord G&aacute;is are considering how to produce bio-methane gas from animal waste.  If anyone will figure out how to do it in a cost-effective way, it will be at that level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300005#F00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Larry O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1350998700,"counter":793,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. O'Connell.

The report, as well as emphasising the role of key agencies on specific issues such as the role of the ESB in regard to electric vehicles and SEAI on energy efficiency, supports the view of SEAI that although retrofit appears to make good sense, in terms of payback for a household, there is no guarantee that is what will happen.  There are a range of obstacles to this, some of which might be overcome through more collective approaches such as, for example, estimation of possible retrofit if carried out on a house by house basis, the cost of which would be higher than that of a group or collective scheme.  In the long run, progress on these issues will depend on a high level of engagement.  Ireland, as we know, has a vibrant community life although to a lesser extent in the area of energy than in many other areas such as culture and so on.  A theme of the report, one which is emerging internationally, is the need to get beyond information campaigns to engaging households and communities more actively in ways that address the obstacles.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about energy security.

While there is a cost involved, significant amounts of public money are not required.  The major action is that to which I referred earlier, namely, retrofit, in respect of which we all face a tricky challenge.  The public system has relied on a grant based scheme to incentivise retrofit and it has delivered significantly.  However, the current public finance crisis dictates a different approach now.  No one knows exactly what will be achieved through a pay-as-you-save scheme, which would require no upfront money from the household but would still yield the savings, energy and otherwise.  That is the key idea everyone is keen to explore.  Nobody is foolish enough to claim that they have cracked what that looks like.

In the witnesses' view, how important is it to engage stakeholders directly in this process, including implementation, design and so on?  Some organisations are of the view that we should develop policy and legislation first, following which everything else will fall into place.  In my view, stakeholders should be involved from the outset.  We need to encourage buy-in and understanding if we are going to effect real change.  I am interested to hear the witnesses view on this.<\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Murphy that we need to change attitudes towards energy efficiency.  The SEAI must be complimented on some of the schemes it has operated to date.  How do we go about supplementing those schemes?  The SEAI is currently running a community scheme, in respect of which it invited submissions from local authorities and community groups, which is very successful.  However, what we need now is information on the outcome of schemes, including on savings achieved and reductions in carbon emissions.  The pay-as-you-save scheme was mentioned.  We need to see more details on that scheme also.<\/p><p>  To what extent has the report addressed issues such as co-ordination between public authorities in terms of achieving a reduction in carbon emissions?  If institutions of the State are not addressing this matter in a co-ordinated, consistent fashion, how then can we expect citizens to do so?  We need to start with facilities in respect of which the State has facilities management, including public buildings such as schools, institutions, Garda stations, Leinster House and so on.  We need to show where the real reductions in carbon emissions are being achieved by way of new technologies and so on.  There are some measures of this type in place.  The SEAI, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, recently launched a new website for schools in relation to energy conservation and reducing carbon emissions.  However, we need to go beyond this.  Does the report detail how this type of action could be co-ordinated at public sector level prior to engagement at citizenship level?  <\/p><p>  In my view, many of the schemes previously introduced were priced way above what was possible for ordinary people, in particular in rural Ireland.  Elderly people do not understand geothermal renewable schemes and certainly cannot afford them.  I do not understand why we do not incentivise the replacement of an open fire, which is approximately 20% efficient, with a solid fuel stove, which is almost 75% efficient.  This would allow people to ensure proper heating of their homes at a much reduced cost.

That is an important question, which is addressed in the final chapter of the report, although not in a definitive way.  We were anxious to make the point that low level policy, which includes agencies, communities, schools and so on, is as important as high level policy.

It would be desirable to open public procurement to renewable heating, which can be an attractive option in some parts of the country.  It is hard for renewable heating, with biomass as the main option, to be competitive with gas but parts of the country are not on the gas network and there may be a reasonably high demand for energy.

Ireland has, by international standards, relatively low carbon production of food, even if within our own national emissions agriculture accounts for a very significant proportion of that.  There are parallel developments in mind for that.  One is that over time it is possible - although not certain - that the international accounting framework for agriculture and land use, which is already evolving, will develop in a way suited to Ireland's interests.  Irish experts in the international accounting community are very active in that space but any kind of leadership position in food aspects of environment and climate depend on us doing to the highest possible standard what we claim to do.

I would like to clarify our approach to the carbon tax and the role of the carbon tax in climate change policy.  In other countries, the willingness and ability to impose carbon taxes and-or heavy emissions trading caps has historically been closely linked to the availability of alternatives.  The strategy we are talking about does not involve forcing the transport sector, for example, into change through the heavy imposition of taxes.  We are saying that a gradual increase in the tax needs to be accompanied by measures which make the alternatives more available and attractive.  For example, we can take vigorous action to encourage gas to be used in vehicle transport.  The strategy is not based on increasing prices heavily to force people to make changes.  Gradual tax increases, which can act as a disincentive to certain kinds of activity, must be combined with action to make alternatives available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300009#K01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rory O'Donnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351001100,"counter":834,"content":"<p>We are aware of the difficulties that occurred under the last biomass scheme.

The opening statement and other documents they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website this afternoon.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p> The document we are discussing was published last week.  Members of the committee were displeased, to say the least, that they did not receive an official invite to the event and I empathise with them.  It was an unfortunate oversight, but I realise that the decision was not within the remit of the officials before the committee.  I thank them for appearing before it at short notice.  I acknowledge that we have received a lengthy opening statement, despite the fact that we did not realistically expect to receive one, given the short timeframe between the issuing of the invitation and its acceptance.<\/p><p> Local government reform is a significant issue, one in which we are all interested.  Almost without exception, Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas would have begun their careers on councils.  Local government is an innate part of the role of the individuals with whom the delegation is engaging.  We all know the system and its failings and how it should be reformed.  Members will focus on certain issues.  I call on the delegation to address how the new local government structures will be used to bind natural communities together in a community context.  This relates to its role in terms of economic units enhancing local development, job creation opportunities and the important role local government has to play with regard to industrial units, agrifood units and creating sustainable jobs in rural areas, as well as the critical role of the planning process, especially in trying to maintain the vitality and vibrancy of town centres.<\/p><p> Local government is for everyone on all parts of the island, not only those in town centres.  There is a critical role to be played in terms of areas not be covered by municipal district councils.  I call on the delegation to elaborate on the role municipal districts will play.  Obviously, there are reservations, in part due to the abolition of town councils.  We can see the streamlining of local government and, in particular, the role municipal districts will play.  They will have a role along the lines of that of area committees.  We are keen to see the establishment of better local government and the creation of strategic policy committees.  We want to avoid duplication and creating a system that, to all intents and purposes, is meaningless.  This must be real reform.  Reductionism is not reform; reform is led from the bottom up and the top down.  It is a strong role.  I am keen to tease out the issue of municipal districts, how they will be brought into being and the role the reformed local government sector will have in areas that are not town centres.  Substantial hinterlands in counties have never been covered by a town council.  What is to be the role played in respect of these areas in the future?  I call on the delegation to address these points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300011#M00200","speaker":"996","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351002300,"counter":849,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for giving us this opportunity to brief the committee.  We are due to be joined by another colleague, Mr. Aidan O'Reilly, from our community division.  He was unable to make it for the starting time, but I hope he will join us later.  <\/p><p>  We are grateful for the opportunity to brief the committee on the Government's recently launched document, Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government.  We are at the committee's disposal to provide as much clarification as we can with regard to the programme which was published on 16 October following Government approval.  We are keen to report to the Minister the views of the committee which could help to inform the more detailed development and implementation of the reform programme.  This opening statement outlines the main features of the reform programme.  It may help to set out a context for the committee's deliberations.  We will be happy to deal as fully as possible with its questions on the contents of the programme.  We note the issues the Chairman has drawn to our attention.<\/p><p>  The action programme sets out Government policy for reform in all the main areas of local government, including structures, functions, funding, operational arrangements, governance, the role of the executive and the elected council and engagement with local communities.  It addresses several fundamental issues in local government structures that have been problematic for several years, including outdated structures and the fact that the functions of local government are much narrower than in most democratic states.  It draws on the constitutional status which local government enjoys as the second tier of government in the State.  It also recognises the uniqueness of local government compared with other elements of the public service in terms of engaging with the public as citizens, as well as clients or customers.<\/p><p>  The programme is based on a strong rationale and purpose for local government which is expressed in the vision for the future of local government set out at the start of the policy document.  It states local government will be the main vehicle of governance and public service at local level, leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services and representing citizens and communities as effectively and accountably as possible.  In keeping with that vision, the document contains a firm commitment that local government will not in the future be bypassed by the establishment of other structures of local administration outside the local government system, unless there is a compelling reason for doing so.  The logic of this principle is that it is wasteful and inefficient for local government in Ireland to be under-utilised.  Since we have an extensive system of local government that extends throughout the country, with more than 28,000 staff and a total spend of some &euro;7 billion, it should be used as fully as possible to perform the functions of public administration and service delivery at local level.  Local government, rather than centralised agencies, should be the first port of call to solve local problems, decide local issues and provide local services.  The action programme states the potential of local government will be maximised through effective, accountable representation and efficient delivery of services; a strong sense of local ownership and responsibility; and decision making close to the local community by those who best understand its needs and appreciate its potential.<\/p><p>  The programme sets out a course of action to achieve the vision outlined for local government.  The qualities and achievements of local government in Ireland are acknowledged, not least the response to the recent financial crisis, in respect of which, despite shedding 25% of staff and making savings of more than &euro;830 million, local authorities have maintained services at a good standard.  However, the shortcomings in the system and issues that need to be addressed are clearly and frankly identified.  The document identifies a key problem with local government for many years, that is, a lack of confidence and credibility in the system.  This was a key reason previous proposals to devolve functions from central to local government came to little.  Lack of commitment on the part of central agencies and perhaps unrealistic expectations of what could be achieved quickly were probably also factors.  There has been a reluctance to devolve functions that are standard activities of local government in most countries and a view that the current system of local government needs reform and modernisation to build credibility and confidence.<\/p><p>  The local government system is often seen as outdated with anomalies, inconsistencies and structural and other deficiencies.  These include structures that have changed little since Victorian times; a disparate array of authorities, many lacking the scale or resources to support significant functions; some small towns with their own council, while larger ones are without municipal status; boundaries that bear little resemblance to current realities; some neighbouring authorities that compete instead of co-operate; elected bodies with limited revenue-raising powers and, as a result, limited accountability, responsibility and self-reliance; fragmented operating arrangements, with duplication and diseconomies; and systems of governance, performance measurement and public engagement that have lagged behind best modern practice.  The action programme for effective local government aims to address the weaknesses in the system, enhance capacity and improve performance throughout the entire system.  This involves reform of all its key elements, including structures, functions, resources, operational arrangements and governance.<\/p><p>  Strengthening the role of local government is a fundamental aim of reform.  Several measures are being taken to bring this about.  Local authorities are taking on key functions in the economic and local development areas.  The incorporation of the micro enterprise support function was a landmark decision for local government.  This will be augmented by several further enhancements to the economic function at local and regional level under the action programme.<\/p> <p>Alignment of the local development and local government sectors will be carried forward on the basis of the report of an alignment steering group which has been published in conjunction with the launch of the reform programme.  An initial programme of devolution from central agencies to local level will be undertaken, together with a process of delegation of greater responsibility to local authorities in respect of a range of matters in which they are involved but where there is scope to reduce the degree of central controls.  Local authority involvement with other sectors will be increased.  An ongoing process of devolution and widening of the role of local government will be implemented as reform of the local government system takes effect and there will be engagement with other Departments to identify additional functions that may be suitable for devolution.<\/p><p> The most fundamental reorganisation of local government structures since the current system began in the 1800s will be undertaken.  A number of city and county local authorities will be unified.  There will be extensive change at regional level, with rationalisation of structures and updating and upgrading of functions.  At sub-county level, a new system of municipal governance will be introduced.  The existing local authority towns and larger centres that do not have local authority status will be combined with their natural hinterlands within their own counties to form municipal districts.  Members will be elected in the first instance to the district, with the members from all the districts in a county combining to form the county council.<\/p><p> Members will perform a substantial range of functions at district level on a fully devolved basis, including, for example, adoption of local area plans, housing services plans, by-laws, approval of annual roads programmes and so on.  Matters of relevance to the district will, as far as possible, be decided by the municipal district council while those of wider strategic interest, such as the county development plan, overall estimates, housing allocation schemes, development contribution schemes, and new functions under the programme relating to economic development plans and local and community plans will be dealt with county level.  While a range of reserved functions will be performed at district level, the administrative and operational organisation will be integrated on a county-wide basis and that strengthened resource will be at the disposal of the members at both county and district level.  It will be for the members and executive in each county to determine the most effective organisation and delivery of the various services within the county.<\/p><p> The action programme envisages a range of benefits arising from the new arrangements.  Anomalies and inconsistencies will be removed and the current uneven assortment of town councils will be replaced by a comprehensive and streamlined system of municipal government closer to the European model.  Functions will be matched to structures and resources and duplication will be eliminated.  Decision making and the business of councils will be brought closer to local communities.  The practice of having duplicate town and county services, multiple processes and documents such as development plans within a county - for instance, as many as ten in Cork and nine in Tipperary - will be ended.  Similarly, the practice of people in a town and its suburbs having to deal with different offices will no longer apply.  In other words, there will be no duplicate representation in towns.<\/p><p> The action programme confirms that the city or county will continue to be the core element of local government.  However, the system will be strengthened by unification of authorities in some areas, while fully maintaining county identities.  This process is well under way in Limerick and Tipperary and reports by the implementation groups have been published.  The Government has now decided that Waterford city and county councils should also be combined to form a single local authority, with Waterford city at its centre becoming a much more dynamic force for growth in the future.  The identity and civic status of the city, including the office of mayor, will be maintained in the new municipal system.  This decision is based on the strong recommendation of the statutory committee whose report has also been published.  The next phase will be the appointment of an independently chaired implementation group to oversee and guide the reorganisation process.<\/p><p> The Minister will announce the appointment of an independent statutory committee to carry out a local electoral review on which the new municipal districts will be based.  Criteria and parameters for the new sub-county system are set out in the action programme and will be reflected in the committee's terms of reference.  The electoral review will have a specific goal of achieving better balance and consistency in representational ratios, while taking particular account of factors such as the location of towns and local identities in the new municipal governance arrangement.  The terms of reference for the review will contain the parameters defining the total number of seats on each council.  These will take account of the significant population changes that have taken place since the current numbers were decided while, at the same time, ensuring adequate numbers for effective representation and governance in lower population counties.<\/p><p> Local government funding, accountability and governance will be strengthened in a number of ways.  The combined budgets of local authorities totalled approximately &euro;7 billion in 2011, made up of &euro;4.8 billion of current expenditure and an estimated &euro;2.2 billion in capital outlay.  Some 41% of current expenditure is funded from central sources, with the remainder being funded largely by a combination of commercial rates, which accounted for 30%, and charges for local authority goods and services at 27%.  The action programme recognises the role of an equitable property tax, which is the subject of a report by an independently chaired interdepartmental expert group, in funding local authority services.  The programme also acknowledges the logical link between financial responsibility and local democratic decision making.  The Minister has referred to the objective of giving local authorities an appropriate measure of discretion in regard to the level of property tax.<\/p><p> A new system of local government oversight will be introduced, involving the establishment of a national oversight and audit commission.  Aspects of the local government audit system will be strengthened.  The role and functions of the elected council will be increased and policy-making structures will be reviewed.  The local government ethics code will be strengthened and merged into a single national system.  Important changes will be made to the directive powers of councillors arising from certain recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  This involves excluding the use of powers under section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 and decisions involving financial or other benefit to an individual or a specific organisation. <\/p><p> The action programme incorporates a major efficiency agenda, based particularly on implementation of measures arising from the local government efficiency review.  Significant annual savings will be achieved through efficiency measures and workforce planning in local authorities.  There will be a more robust system of performance monitoring with a focus on key indicators, outcomes rather than outputs, value for money, and comparative performance of authorities.  Customer service arrangements in local authorities will be further enhanced.  Ways of promoting greater community and citizen engagement with local government will be explored, and local authorities will be required to provide better quality public information.  It is estimated that the measures outlined in the programme will lead to savings of more than &euro;400 million per annum when all the reforms are in place.  These will be enduring savings in the budgets of local authorities.<\/p><p> The Government has decided that changes such as the introduction of an office of directly elected mayor in Dublin, as has been suggested, should not take place without a more fundamental, rigorous review of local governance generally in the area.  It has, therefore, decided that a forum on local governance in Dublin should be convened.  Based on these deliberations, proposals will be put to a plebiscite in conjunction with the 2014 elections.  However, the electoral review will be based on increased representation in the Dublin areas, to address current high ratios of population to councillors.  The question of replacing sub-county structures does not arise in Dublin as in other counties.  However, the county councils will be given power to operate a system of devolved decision making at electoral level if they so choose.<\/p><p> The shape of future governance arrangements in Dublin will depend on the outcome of the proposed forum.  However, the action programme indicates there is a case in principle for a metropolitan council or assembly, but only in the context of revised and efficient local governance arrangements.  Such an authority would need to have significant functions and budget, with the possibility of a directly elected mayor, depending on the outcome of the forum and a subsequent plebiscite.  Functions and funding would inevitably come from transfer from the current local authorities and central Departments and agencies.  The types of sectors from which metropolitan level functions might, in principle, be drawn include transport, economic and spatial strategy, education, policing, emergency planning, waste management and a co-ordination and oversight, or \"call-in\", role in respect of certain local authority functions having a metropolitan impact.  Proposals for revised local government arrangements in Dublin must, however, take account of cost implications and will be subject to prevailing economic circumstances.<\/p><p> Implementation of the reforms will be challenging, both at local and national level, requiring a major programme of legislation and reorganisation in the coming years.  It is essential to deliver that programme successfully ahead of the 2014 local elections.  Indeed, some elements, like the electoral review, must be completed at least 12 months in advance of those elections.  As well as implementing significant changes from 2014, the action programme has the objective of positioning the local government sector for continued development.<\/p> <p>By putting in place stronger structures, functions, resources, governance and operational arrangements, the reforms should enable the local government sector to play a much wider and more effective role in the longer term, with the possibility of taking on a much wider range of functions of the sort that local authorities perform in other European countries.<\/p><p> The reform programme will move quickly to the implementation phase and there will be opportunity for interested parties, including the committee, to make an input particularly in the context of the legislation. Today's meeting is a very good way of beginning that process.

Is it fair to say that this policy, as enunciated by Mr. Dowling, has been in the process of being developed for the past ten or more years and that the officials' predecessors in the Department have been generally working towards this outcome?  Is that one of the reasons we have seen a steady diminution and devolution of responsibilities from town councils to county councils in terms of water services and so on?<\/p><p>  Mr. Dowling is no doubt aware that we in Ireland have almost the smallest local authority operation in the whole of the  EU in that each elected representative in Ireland at local level is elected by approximately 2,500 people on the register of electors, as opposed to approximately 1,000 in Denmark and significantly fewer than that in France.  Bearing that knowledge in mind, how does Mr. Dowling make sense of a drastic swingeing reduction in the number of elected members and a reduction in the number of local authorities and assemblies?

We hope we learned from the past and previous work that has been undertaken but the practical position is that there has not been a reform programme on a scale which has sought to tackle the range of issues.  The Deputy is right in that there have been difficulties in regard to the interplay between town and county structures and the reform programme is intended to resolve this for once and for all.  The Chairman asked about this point in terms of the municipal districts.  It is important before I deal with the Deputy's second question to spend a little time on this point, if that is appropriate at this stage.  It is crucial to the overall reform process that we would all have a shared understanding of what is intended as part of the municipal districts proposal.<\/p><p>  In terms of the facts, I will outline the principal features of the model.  It is important to do this because it will resolve the question that this is not some kind of a continuum of an approach in regard to towns when it is quite the opposite.  Our sub-county structures are intended to resolve a series of issues which have bedevilled local government as it has operated between the county and town.  There will be a comprehensive territorial configuration of each county into municipal districts.  We do not have that in place at present because some places have towns and often towns have formed there for simply historical reasons.  As I said in my statement, and Deputies will know this, many substantial towns do not have a similar structure in this respect and therefore there is an issue of coverage.  <\/p><p>  Second, members in the first instance will be elected to the municipal districts.  I understand the Minister said in the D&aacute;il earlier today that this is not a question of the abolition of structures but of generating new structures that integrate municipal representation which at present is currently undertaken through towns.  l believe the Minister would also emphasise his recognition and acknowledgment of the very strong connectivity  at local level in towns between elected members and their constituents.  The approach here seeks to build on that very strong relationship.  <\/p><p>  Third, there will not be a separate or parallel set of local authority members at the two levels.  This is critical in terms of resolving this issue as between the different levels of government.  Therefore, there will not be rivalry, competition or any inconsistency between what can happen within counties at the sub-county and county level.  Furthermore, there will be a single countywide executive or operational structure and no duplicate administrative or organisational overhead to eliminate the need for duplication of structures because in a sense there will be a single administrative structure which supports the representation of the municipal district level and the county level. <\/p><p>  The organisation format of local government will involve a single corporate entity incorporating the two elements of jurisdiction for the elected members, namely, the countywide level and the district level.  In a sense we will not have duplication of organisational structures, instead we will have different forms of representation which will come together to resolve these various issues.  <\/p><p>  This bring me to the question of functions.  The key emphasis here is on subsidiarity to ensure that matters which should be dealt with locally at the level of the citizen at municipal level are dealt with at the level.  We gave some examples in the statement and there are further examples in the action programme such as the local area plans, the housing services plans and so on.   On the other hand, and in response to a point the Deputy raised, we know there have been particular difficulties in trying to secure a coherent approach to planning where there can often be competing development plans.  We know equally that in terms of the engagement of businesses with local government there can often be competing issues between the rating decisions taken by individual towns and the rating decisions taken by wider country.  This approach seeks to resolve these issues which have stood in the way of previous reform efforts.  We do not underestimate the challenge involved in putting these arrangements in place but there will be significant legislation to do it, as I said in the statement.  It will have to be done well in advance of the local elections to give people time to prepare for that but there will also be time in terms of the preparation of the legislation when we can hear people's further views as to the way in which powers between the sub-county, the municipal district level and county level ought to be developed.<\/p><p>  As regards the overall numbers, and my colleagues may wish to supplement what I have said on these matters, the committee will recognise that there is huge unevenness in the ratio of representation throughout the country.  The restructuring will seek to ensure there will be greater evenness across that to secure an appropriate level of representation.  The Minister said in the D&aacute;il earlier today that the primary objective here is not to achieve financial savings but that given the economic position would we not be very inconsistent if we did not bring forward proposals which had a major benefit in terms of the public finances.  If we take the three central issues at present as being the need to create and sustain jobs, protect competitiveness and address the public finances, this overall programme, the Minister suggests, addresses all three through building new structures, modernising our approaches to efficiency and, hopefully, in time building greater confidence in our local government system.  We can draw enough inspiration from experiences abroad to show that we are on the right track in terms of the municipal approach trying to reconcile the different levels of government as between regional, county and municipal, and the doing of that will also hopefully bring about reductions and make the contributions local government has done during the past few years in terms of the public finances.  Mr. Conlan may wish to make some further comments on the municipal districts approach. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300014#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Dowling"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351004100,"counter":857,"content":"<p>One point occurs to me that is relevant to the question and which has escaped much of the reportage, which is the policy document proposes that a significant range of reserved functions of the elected members will be devolved to district level.  This is a significant distinction from the current system of area committees, which really are advisory structures.  I also wish to make the related point that in respect of the historical trend regarding towns, functions and so on, it generally is accepted that the town authorities have become somewhat marginalised over the years.  If one considers different reports that have been published, I note a report was adopted in 1972 by the then Government, which effectively would have replaced the 80 town authorities by committees of the county council.  In 1991, the Barrington report contained two divided recommendations, one of which again recommended replacement of the town councils by area committees.  In recent years, the McCarthy report recommended the outright abolition of town authorities.  The local government efficiency review did not have in its terms of reference the authority to make recommendations on the structures but it recommended that rating, housing, roads and planning functions would be removed from town authorities.  Consequently, what is proposed in the document under discussion should be considered against that background.<\/p><p>  Part of the problem in the past regarding what one might call a dismissive attitude to town councils has been that the recommendations tended to be largely grounded on the considerations of operational efficiency.  The view was taken that towns are too small to be efficient and therefore they must go.  This document attempts to differentiate between the operational and the administrative element and the policy making, the role of the elected members.  This is an absolutely fundamental and key aspect of this action programme that must be borne in mind.  The document proposes that there be operational and administrative integration but devolved decision making across a significant range of functions to the districts and to members meeting as a municipal district council.  Moreover, as Mr. Des Dowling has stated, it will cover the totality of the State, including some very large centres of population that have no sub-county authorities at present.  This may be one relevant point to bear in mind with regard to functions, the trend in local government and the different views that have been taken over the years.  This is a significant change in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300015#Q00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Conlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1351004100,"counter":858,"content":"<p>May I ask two questions in that regard?

However, it will be a matter for the councils in each case to decide, as part of their own financial dispensation and so forth, what is the best use to make of those buildings.  As for the staff, the staff of all town councils will become part of the unified staff.  As I noted just now, on the administrative side the proposal is for full integration into a countywide administrative structure.  As for how things go with regard to numbers and similar matters, that is part of the wider process.  It already is clear that the local government sector has reduced staffing more than any other part of the public service and the Minister himself dealt with this issue at some length today during Question Time in the D&aacute;il.  While a further reduction in staff of 500 is scheduled, it is clear they all will be managed within the framework of the Croke Park agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300015#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Conlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1351004100,"counter":860,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation and have one question in this regard.

The priority in the action programme obviously is to give emphasis to the role of the elected member in the first instance.  This is something to which we gave a fair amount of attention in the advance discussions on and subsequent preparation of the document because it often is the case that as they discuss these issues with us, even members themselves acknowledge they often underestimate the extent of the powers available to them.  The document sets out at considerable length the range of powers for the elected member, as opposed to the executives or the managers, as they are described at present.  The Minister sought to reinforce this emphasis by stating that in terms of a current approach, the elected council effectively should be perceived, in business parlance, as the board of directors and the manager should be perceived as being the chief executive and reporting to the council in that way.  There are two dimensions to this, the first of which is to recognise the powers elected members already have.  The second is to seek to try to enhance them and obviously, the operation of the municipal district approach should enhance that further in respect of pushing it down to the lowest possible level.  Thereafter, the manager or then chief executive - which will require legislation - will be clearly answerable in that regard and should report in the same way as does a chief executive to a board of directors in a business organisation.  There is the substantive issue but also the important issue of its appearance, that is, that the individual concerned is the chief executive but reports to the elected members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300015#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Dowling"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351004100,"counter":862,"content":"<p>I will mention a few small points in this regard.

There will be some new functions straightaway, such as the adoption of economic development, local and community and service plans.  There is a commitment to consider further additional reserved functions.  Moreover, in the legislation that must be introduced to implement these proposals, there is a commitment to making changes in the provisions relating to the powers of members versus managers that would strengthen the obligation on managers to comply with the policy decisions of the elected members.  In this respect, my guess is that some of the reportage perhaps again has created the impression of a reduction in members' powers by focusing on the provision relating to section 140.  This is something that tends to be latched onto a little bit and is presented as a wholesale reduction in members' powers but in fact, the thrust of the document is very much in the other direction and the change to the title and role of chief executive is consistent with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300015#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Conlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1351004100,"counter":863,"content":"<p>In his presentation, Mr. Dowling stated that structures have changed little since Victorian times.

It seems a crazy way of dealing with regional authorities.  <\/p><p> The third issue concerns staffing.  The Chairman has made the same point on resources, including buildings.  On a practical level, if former urban district councils and town commissions are included - which would have been better resourced in the county council - the staff are already in those locations.  It may not be viable to have somebody going from one end of Cork to the other - that county involves the greatest change in numbers, along with Tipperary.

It will be pretty difficult to have a uniform system of service delivery within the range of municipal districts in the context of that change and with the backdrop of a reduction in numbers rather than an increase.<\/p><p> In areas that have lost an urban council, there is an expectation that they will continue to have the same level of service.  On a practical level that seems to be a serious problem and I do not see where it will be addressed.  There is not an even spread of staffing around the country.

To start at the top level, the emphasis has been on trying to maintain a connection with the citizen wherever possible.  I know about the Deputy's own experience at town government level and anybody involved in that sector continuously emphasises this point.  The practical position is, however, that there is huge unevenness among towns across the country.  It has grown from a historical aspect rather than from a planned approach.  We have to move from the present system to try to achieve greater evenness.  As the policy document says, we must capitalise on that connectivity at a local level but in a way that does not compete with the interests of managing matters overall in the county.<\/p><p>  We should make a distinction between the way area committees have operated and what the new municipal districts will do.  The area committees deal with county matters from an area viewpoint, which is quite different to the range of functions town authorities have traditionally had and which municipal districts will have in the new configuration.  They are intended to be integrated at county level.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the connectivity the Deputy has mentioned, we should also acknowledge the duplication in various counties between town and county.  That is not in the interest of citizens who may wish to do their business in a particular way but may have both town and county offices in a particular area.  The programme seeks to rationalise that in a way that makes sense to the citizen, rather than from a bureaucrat's perspective.<\/p><p>  This will not necessarily be a quick process but it can only lead to a better outcome for ratepayers and taxpayers.  There will be work involved in rationalising offices.  Mr. Conlan has already referred to the extent to which council chambers and meeting places will be required for municipal districts.  In respect of functions at local level, certain service points have to be provided for people who want to do their business with the local authority.  As the Deputy's question implied, each local authority will have a different position depending on the current dispensation and the extent to which town authorities already have offices in the area.  Starting from now, authorities will put in place plans to lead to a better organisation.<\/p><p>  Earlier this afternoon in the D&aacute;il, the Minister covered regional government fairly closely.  The emphasis was to try to maximise representation at the lowest possible level, by securing election in the first instance to municipal districts and secondly at county level.

The issue is the degree to which the current factual position can be made as even as possible within the existing structures.  Due to the approach that will be taken, we are building on existing town structures and dealing with existing hinterlands.  That gives the potential to draw on existing resources, so there should not be a huge mismatch between staffing and resources at municipal level, which can then be integrated into an overall county-based approach.

I have a couple of questions concerning the opening statement.  It was said that significant annual savings would be achieved through efficiency measures and workforce planning in local authorities.  Can Mr. Dowling expand on this?  Members will be aware that there is provision for a targeted redundancy package within local authorities, so how will this work?  Will county managers or the new chief executive officers be asked by the Department to recommend reductions of key personnel at certain levels, such as senior executive engineers, directors of services and other higher grades?  Will existing personnel covering smaller counties be asked to extend their remit across other counties to share services involving fire officers, veterinary officers, county librarians, arts officers and heritage officers?  Does Mr. Dowling think this can be achieved in the plan?<\/p><p>  I have another question concerning my own local authority in Sligo.  \"Municipal authorities\" is the name suggested for the sub-level of local government in the document.  Will some towns or cities be called municipal boroughs mainly for historic reasons?  I know it will apply in a number of boroughs.  Sligo Borough Council, for example, was granted this title in 1613 by King James I.  If the council was allowed to keep this name for historical and tourism reasons it would be a good step.  It would not in any way dilute the Department's proposal, particularly from a cost viewpoint.<\/p><p>  On page 54, the report refers to the establishment of a socioeconomic committee, SEC, by each city and county council, which will have responsibility for planning and oversight of all local community and development programmes.  The SEC will play a key role in decision making on EU and national funding programmes and interventions, as well as certain co-ordination functions of county development boards, which will in effect be replaced by the SECs.<\/p> <p>This will afford local authorities opportunities for greater involvement in planning oversight and management of locally focused programmes, as well as providing for greater co-ordination across the full breadth of these programmes.  How does the Department see the role of the current boards following the establishment of the new socioeconomic committees, SECs?  Will they have a diminished function?  Will local authority members still sit on these boards or has this been worked out yet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300016#R00600","speaker":"1082","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351005300,"counter":873,"content":"<p>With regard to the overall question of savings, we did contextualise this in terms of the overall reform process.  The Deputy is correct that there is an indication that we would seek to achieve a further reduction of around 500 members of staff on a voluntary basis, specifically arising from an exercise in workforce planning.  The main objective was to recognise that as the local government sector has sought to reduce overall numbers, it can happen in an <i>ad hoc<\/i> way.  One of the tools we needed was to be able to look at each authority and have a template whereby one could judge the extent to which the structure was in keeping with the requirements and funding available.  Accordingly, the Department engaged with the County and City Managers Association, CCMA, to put together a workforce plan.  This was particularly aimed at administrative and management levels.  There would have been recognition that, in the reductions to date and partly due to demographic factors of an older workforce at front-line level, we needed to go faster in reductions at management and administrative level.  It was also recognised, however, that we needed to have a workforce plan that would provide a template against which that would be judged.  The additional 500 will be mainly at those management levels.<\/p><p>  It will be in line with the Croke Park agreement, as we averted to earlier.  There is a variety of means by which those reductions can be achieved, whether through redeployment or a redundancy package.  Overall, we want to get the least and optimal in terms of individual structures for local authorities.  Again, one can see significant variation across authorities on this.  The McLaughlin group originally drew attention to this.  For example, there were 230 people at director of service level.  That is now below 200 on the basis of the McLaughlin recommendation that it should be 190.  I would foresee it going below that level further through the workforce planning exercise.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to cross-boundary arrangements which already exist.  For example, Dublin City Council manages on a national basis the internal movement of hazardous waste while Offaly County Council has become the lead authority in respect of waste collection permitting.  While we want to progress a shared-services approach, it can happen at both national and local level.  The Minister has said that while he certainly sees the need for a single executive leader reporting to elected local authority members, he also sees significant scope for a shared services approach.  As regards the boroughs, the action programme does give recognition to this issue.  While the terminology and so on will be set out in legislation, it would be anticipated that one would have an arrangement equivalent to borough districts to recognise those locations where a borough council exists and take in its hinterland as well as retain the ceremonial and other civic elements of those structures.<\/p><p>  The SECs fits within the broader question of the relationship between local government and local development entities.  This has been the subject of examination by a steering group and the report of it was published with the action programme.  The task has been to recognise first the community function rests with the Minister.  Accordingly, there must be recognition that this community element has developed and has its own strengths.  In seeking to achieve the best alignment between it and local government, we must draw on both their strengths and the bottom-up approach which has been developed on the community side.  Alongside of that, there must be recognition that within counties the very best interactions and results in either the social or economic area are invariably achieved through good interagency co-operation.  There is very mixed experience in this but we need a structure which fully involves and takes in the community piece, as well as the funding and organisation of that.

The action programme is quite detailed and has led to some confusion in the past week.  Last Saturday, I attended a special delegate conference of my nominating body, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, at which more than 130 councillors were present.  To say they were confused would be an understatement.  Several questions were raised with me at the meeting.<\/p><p>  The establishment of the new local government system is arrived at by dividing 4,830 people into the population of the country giving a figure of 950 councillors.  How was this formula devised?  The original announcement was that there would six to nine councillors per district.  It has now increased to ten.  Is there further flexibility in that?<\/p><p>  Much play has been made of the abolition of section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001.  I have been informed strongly that most of the planning scandals came from other mechanisms of altering planning as opposed to provisions under section 140.  In rural areas, section 140 dealt with specific one-off housing cases involving families and family members.  Will the rest of the planning issues be examined which have been raised in the Mahon tribunal report?<\/p><p>  It is proposed to change the county or city manager title to chief executive officer.  My understanding is that chief executive officers implement policy but do not make it.  There is no reference in the proposals to the City and County Management (Amendment) Act 1955 which gives the managers most of the powers they have.  Will that legislation be rescinded?<\/p> <p> Mr. Dowling indicated that he will seek to enhance the role of councillors by giving them new powers.  For the last 18 months we were told that the designation of managers as CEOs meant that they would be doing the job of a CEO in terms of implementing policy rather than making it.  I ask for clarification in that regard.<\/p><p> When will the boundary commission be established?  This is an issue of great concern because people are awaiting the opportunity to make submissions to it.  When will we see first light of the legislation, or at least the heads of a Bill?  Will it be published before Christmas?  For 18 months the new bodies were referred to as municipal district councils but the documents now refer to them as municipal districts, which has a completely different meaning to \"municipal district councils\".  Can we ensure that the new legislation gives them the proper title of \"municipal district councils\"?<\/p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the fact that three regional assemblies are to be established.  I am interested in the powers they will be given.  I served on a regional authority for many years and I also served on the committee of the regions.  The disparity between what regional government does in this country compared with every other country in Europe is immeasurable.  Can Mr. Dowling clearly explain the role that the new regional assemblies will play?  Will they have powers to disburse European funding?<\/p><p> How will the budgets for district councils be arrived at?  Will they be required to make annual submissions to the county councils for their budgets?  Has a template for such a process been devised and, if not, how is the process envisaged and how will the new property tax impinge on it?  Despite that fact that we are in the middle of the worst recession in many years, many town councils enjoy budget surpluses or own property.  In County Meath, for example, a large tract of land was handed over to Kells Town Council by a private donor.  What will happen to these surpluses and properties in the new structure?<\/p><p> How often will the new municipal district councils and county councils hold meetings?  Will Irish Water be answerable to the new local government system?  I was led to believe by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O'Dowd, that it would be answerable solely to the Oireachtas.  In regard to economic development at local level, will the new entity comprise elected members or will the four pillars continue to be involved?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300017#S00600","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351005900,"counter":879,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleagues to address some of the wide range of questions raised by Senator Landy.  We have worked closely with the AMAI but I recognise this is a significant document and a new approach.  We will probably have to do more on the communications side to explain what it involves and this will happen as implementation proceeds.<\/p><p>  The Senator referred to the question of the boundary committee.  I do not have definitive information on that issue, although clearly it will have to proceed fairly quickly.  I expect that the Minister will make an announcement reasonably soon because, as we noted earlier, the local elections are the end point at which the new electoral structures must be ready.  It has been suggested to us that prospective members need at least 12 months in advance of the elections to prepare accordingly.  This would mean that the boundary committee needs to complete its work and provide a template that can be put into legislation by the middle of next year.  This is clearly a significant task but beyond setting out the timetable we have not yet taken a decision which can be communicated to the committee.  I do not doubt the Minister will be making his announcement as soon as he is able to do so.<\/p><p>  The other element is the legislation governing the structural aspects of the municipal districts and a range of other matters.  The approach in this regard will be to give ourselves as much time as possible in advance of the local elections but we cannot determine whether we will be preparing one comprehensive Bill or a number of smaller Bills until we study the details of what is involved.<\/p><p>  I will ask Mr. Conlan to answer the question on ratios but I will continue to answer some of the other questions the Senator raised.  Perhaps the media have put too much emphasis on section 140.  The Minister addressed this issue in the D&aacute;il today.  The practical position is that the number of uses of section 140 in very recent years has been relatively few but it is an issue to which the Mahon tribunal drew attention.  A range of other measures will be introduced regarding ethics in planning sphere and other areas.  In parallel with this reform process, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is considering an ethics scheme that would cover the entire public service and the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has indicated that any updating of the ethics regime as it applies to local government should fit within that broader context.  The Minister has stated that restoring public confidence in the planning system is a key objective and that he will be proceeding with the implementation of the 12 actions contained in the planning review report published in June 2012.  These will entail legislative change and consolidation, revised non-statutory guidelines and improved management systems in planning authorities.  A range of important initiatives are being taken in this regard but most of them are not within my own area.  <\/p><p>  The regional assemblies will have a range of functions.  We want to build on their successful involvement in regional planning guidelines and, as the action programme makes clear, we intend to develop an oversight role in how national policy is delivered at local level, as well as a regional perspective.  The question of the EU role will be addressed in time and it will ultimately be a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, the general desire is that all State authorities and agencies should seek to co-ordinate around the revised regional structures as far as is practical.<\/p><p>  I cannot provide precise details on how the funding arrangements between municipal district and county level will operate at this stage.  These matters will have to be contained in the legislation.  There will be a need for an aggregated budget which can be dealt with at county level.  We foresee some kind of block grant arrangements being put in place but it is important to recognise that the same members will be acting at county level and at municipal district level.  In a sense, the same people will be making decisions on funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300018#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1351005900,"counter":880,"content":"<p>They are elected in the municipal area, not the county.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300018#T00300","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351005900,"counter":881,"content":"<p>This is an important point.

The Minister has spoken on this issue also and I am not sure I can add hugely to what has been placed in the public domain.

With regard to the budgets for the municipal districts, from recollection, the document states specifically that the overall budget for the county will have to take account of the decisions made by members at district level.  It also makes reference to a number of other possible ways of giving specific recognition to the district in the estimates and the funding process, for example, by taking account of it in the determination of block allocations, by taking account of the level of revenue raised within the particular district and - Deputy Murphy referred to this in the D&aacute;il earlier - the fact that towns, including non-rating authorities, have the power to add a certain amount through locally applicable charges.  Something along these lines is mentioned.  However, it will have to be worked out in greater detail in the development of the legislation.<\/p><p>  At regional level, the starting point for the functions of the new regional assemblies should be a combination of the functions of the current assemblies and the regional authorities subject to the point Mr. Dowling made about the next round of EU funding.  It has yet to be fully clarified and determined and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has the lead role in that regard.  The hope is that will be the starting point.  That means, for example, that the regional planning guidelines function will remain and the document provides that it will be significantly strengthened by expanding it to include regional, spatial and economic strategies, with a requirement that all State agencies engage in a more meaningful way with the regional authorities in adopting these strategies and that they adhere to them, particularly in the context of economic development with all of the economic agencies.  The problem up to now has been up that many of the agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, F&Aacute;S and its replacement have had difficulty in engaging with the local government system at county level.  It has become difficult to do it with reduced resources and so forth.  The regional level, therefore, will have a much stronger role in economic development and ensuring there is a coherent approach across the region in order that different cities and areas will not be competing for inward investment with all the players involved at regional level.  The role of the regional assemblies in local government oversight functions is also additional.<\/p><p>  I refer to the ratios and from where the figures and so on come.  Clearly, there will be a significant reduction in the total number of elected members as a result of the changes proposed and, in recognition of this, the Government looked at the scope for increasing the number at county council level.  As a component of this at the district level, clearly in the current financial climate the scope for increased county and city level numbers was somewhat limited and, as a result, the overall number that emerged in the Government decision which is reflected in the document was 950.  It is from this figure that the ratio of 1:4,830 emerges.  If the total population is divided by 950, that is the figure that emerges.  However, the number per area will only emerge as the terms of reference for the electoral review are published and it is a matter for the Minister to set up a committee under the Local Government Acts and set out the terms of reference.  The report gives strong pointers in that direction.  It refers to the figure of 4,830 as a benchmark.  It also refers to the case for having a weighting for the distribution of existing municipal towns that have a local authority and other large centres of population that do not and for town councils and the city areas within the authorities that are merging in Limerick and Waterford.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300019#U00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Conlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006500,"counter":884,"content":"<p>It is, therefore, not written in stone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300019#U00300","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351006500,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I think it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300019#U00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Dowling"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351006500,"counter":886,"content":"<p>The figure of 950 is certain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300019#U00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Conlan"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006500,"counter":887,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the figure is included in the document, but it is not set in stone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300019#U00600","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006500,"counter":888,"content":"<p>Will the Senator, please, allow the delegates to reply without interruption?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300019#U00700","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1351006500,"counter":889,"content":"<p>I am only trying to get a fuller answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300019#U00800","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351006500,"counter":890,"content":"<p>That is about all that can be said on that subject until the terms of reference emerge.<\/p><p>  The Senator referred to the terminology used relating to districts and councils.

The Minister will not lay down the law in that regard.<\/p><p>  A good deal of one chapter of the report is devoted to economic development.  The Minister sees the role of local authorities in economic development as important and the integration of the local enterprise function into the local government system will be a significant development in that regard, in addition to the alignment of the local development sector which has a significant economic component and drawing on best practice.

This is very much the approach we want to build so that local authorities are involved in individual initiatives but they are also involved in a much more strategic way.

It is interesting and gives me some hope.<\/p><p>  The Department looked at other models of local government around the world, for example, in Switzerland.  What models did the Department look at?  Like anything, there is no point in reinventing the wheel when there are good versions of it already.  How will the proposed system enhance the role of a local representative when it comes to holding the executive to account?  Under the current system, it was the other way around.  My experience and that of many other people was that the more one held them to account, the less they answered the phone.  It is troublesome if that has not been improved.  <\/p><p>  When the Department looked at cost savings, did it consider the wages of county managers? In Roscommon, we pay the county manager 50%  more than is paid to the Spanish Prime Minister.  It seems that planning powers are being taken away from county councillors.  Why does the Department believe elected representatives are in a sense less trustworthy than un-elected people because that is what it suggests?  I would prefer someone who was elected and who I have the choice to put out if I was not happy with him or her making these decisions.  A member of the delegation spoke about how section 140 is rarely used.  I know of several occasions where councillors wanted to use it but they pulled back because they were afraid of the consequences of doing so.  In other words, the telephone would not be answered yet again.  <\/p><p>  If the Department was really interested in devolving power to the lowest possible level, why not have more town councils with more powers?  They do not necessarily have to cost money.  Someone once told me that all they could see in the reform was that the Department got rid of the cheap councillors and kept the expensive ones.

The metropolitan areas are mentioned within the document and identified as being established within municipal districts.  What is the actual definition of the metropolitan area in this context?  Is any population threshold set for such metropolitan designation?  Are there any mechanisms in the new reform proposals that will allow metropolitan areas to adopt development plans for areas in adjacent local authorities, for example, through service level agreements?  Two examples are Limerick city, which goes into County Clare, and Waterford city, which has Ferrybank in County Kilkenny directly adjacent but is in that same urban area.  Many would agree that there should be some mechanism to allow the metropolitan or city area to adopt development plans for those urban areas through agreement.<\/p><p>  Mr. Dowling spoke about the amalgamation of Waterford city and county councils.

No matter what configuration one has in local government and there are many good ideas in the document, none of them seem to be predicated on reducing the number of councillors so why should we reduce the number of councillors by such a huge number in the context of Ireland having smaller number of councillors <i>per capita<\/i> than most of Europe.  I cannot get my head around what these municipal councils will be like.  I spent 22 years as a councillor at urban and county level and know what a town council is and what it is to be a county councillor.  They are two totally different job descriptions.  They involve different types of work, engagement with the public and demand.  Clearly, this municipal council will not be just like the area council and will be a different animal.  My town of Listowel has nine town councillors but has not had a county councillor since I was elected to the Seanad in 2007.  That happened for unusual reasons, much of them to do with the political dynamism of the place and family dynasties.  Will we have a situation where there will be a Listowel municipal council without a single councillor from the town and where the chairman of this new council could live 30 miles away, as do some councillors in the electoral district at the moment?

With regard to the overall models, as I touched on earlier we drew inspiration from these rather than stating a definitive model exists which will fit in Ireland.  We participate in the Council of Europe which comprises very different experiences and we have looked further afield.  The manager system as we have it came from the United States.  We look at a variety of models.  The previous Green Paper set out some of these at length, in terms of harvesting previous work done.  However, when it came to it we were more guided by the variety of submissions made from within the country and the key issue has been to try to reconcile the viewpoints on town-based and county-based approaches.  As I stated, perhaps the way the municipality system works in France supports this.  Ultimately, we have had to develop an approach which is unique to here.<\/p><p>  Some of the other questions touch on the benefits of various forms of local administration - we will discuss Waterford later - and the idea of local identity, whether it be with a town or city, and trying to incorporate these into a model of governance which would work in Ireland.  The best answer I can give is that while we drew inspiration from various approaches and from looking further afield, none of them translate directly into the Irish context.  We have tried in the programme to put an emphasis on the elected member, and we drew inspiration from foreign models which seek to emphasise this.  The question of how to enhance this will ultimately be a matter for the members themselves over time.  We want to ensure members have as many tools as possible available to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300021#W00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Dowling"},{"type":"speech","time":1351007700,"counter":905,"content":"<p>My question was very specific with regard to holding the executive to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300021#W00300","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351007700,"counter":906,"content":"<p>One of the specific recommendations is to make the local government auditor available to elected members to provide them with assistance and information they might need to probe the executive with regard to financial matters.  Mr. Conlon referred specifically to examining legislation to ensure elected members can hold the managers and chief executives to account in this way.  Significant powers are already available but we are open to seeing how they can be enhanced further.  The audit is one element and a more general capacity to obtain answers from the executive would be another.<\/p><p>  We did not specifically deal with the question of managers' salaries because they are dealt with in a broader public service context with regard to overall senior management salaries.  The committee is aware of actions have been taken in this regard.  As with other posts, the overall rates have been reduced and the general arrangements for appointment have been brought into line with the Government's new approach using the Top Level Appointments Committee.  The Minister did not consider it necessary to deal with them other than how they have already been dealt with in these broader ways.  Of course there will be fewer county managers and chief executives under the new arrangements.<\/p><p>  We have tried to emphasise that section 140 is an issue, and we would be happy to hear more of what the Deputy has in mind with regard to its particular difficulties and its use or non-use, and how we can further ensure the weighting in decision-making is with the elected member rather than the executive.  Certainly this is the intention of the programme.<\/p><p>  With regard to the overall strengthening of local government, in the documents we have set out a range of functions which would move from central to local government and, in turn, those which would move from county level to municipal level.  This is the starting basis but it is possible, if legislation is being developed, to add to it.  I am certain the Minister will engage further with his colleagues on the move from central to local government in the first instance and then on the local element between city and county authorities and municipal authorities.<\/p><p>  I appreciate there will be as many views on the regional construction as there are variations.  In Dublin we have questions with regard to the city council and the three other local authorities, and when it comes to the region questions raised include what is the greater Dublin area, as this can include parts of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.  Others may consider the eastern seaboard extending as far as Louth to be part of the region.  A balanced view must be taken on how to deal with these considerations, and the Government concluded the best way of trying to resolve this was not by trying to draw a line around Dublin city and county authorities but to deal with it as part of the broader Leinster configurations.<\/p><p>  With regard to Waterford, my colleagues will discuss section 140, strategic policy committees, powers and waste.  The overall savings of amalgamation are set out in the report of the independent group, and are assessed at approximately between &euro;5 million and &euro;9 million.  This is with regard to an overall budget of approximately &euro;127 million between the two local authorities.  It was felt this was a reasonable assessment of what would be achievable having regard to potential duplication of approaches.  It goes without saying corporate services and other headquarter functions have scope for efficiencies when the two authorities are brought together.  The Minister has been at pains to state this is to benefit Waterford as a whole.  Waterford is a very important gateway and this bears on the regional approach, of which Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow are also part, which recognises Waterford's pre-eminence in the south east.  As the Minister stated in the D&aacute;il, it is quite possible to preserve, retain and build on the civic identity as part of this new configuration.  There is no competition between the broader county and the city, which ought to be the key point or pull of attraction for the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300021#W00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Dowling"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351007700,"counter":907,"content":"<p>I will pick up on some of the questions on models.  In the developing the report, a number of sources were examined as was the case with previous reviews.  In the sub-county area in particular it is valid to state the concept of a wider municipality rather than simply the built-up area of a town is very much in line with the European model.<\/p> <p>In France, for example, the sign for a town will be five or six miles - 10 km - outside it.  This fits in with Senator Ned O'Sullivan's question on Listowel which is the centre of its wider hinterland, which is in line with the European model.  Instead of having isolated town authorities, there would be a municipality with an urban centre.  This reflects the fact that communication between a town and its hinterland is greater now than it was when the local government system was put in place in the late 19th century.<\/p><p> Regarding section 140, it is important to point out that the decision is a response to a specific recommendation in the Mahon report rather than any expression of mistrust of elected members.<\/p><p> In terms of regional assemblies, Mr. Dowling mentioned Dublin and the wider area.  Dublin's reach is long and it is difficult to know where exactly to draw a line.  There is no strong regional identity in Ireland.  In Germany and Spain, for example, there are strong and self-defined regional identities that relate to their histories.  It is the same in France to some extent.  Italy was divided until the mid-19th century.  We do not have that type of regional configuration.  However, Dublin and the eastern area have been influenced strongly by spatial considerations, in that Dublin now exerts an influence over a wider area.<\/p><p> The potential of strategic policy committees, SPCs, is referred to in chapter 11.  There are proposals to review their role.  The experience to date of their effectiveness has been mixed.  Proposals include more specific accountability by the relevant directors to SPCs and a general commitment to strengthening the role of SPCs and their chairpersons.  The document recognises the potential in this regard.<\/p><p> The document is not prescriptive about population thresholds in metropolitan areas, but a figure of 100,000 was referred to in the original report by Mr. Denis Brosnan's group and is quoted in this document as the expected target figure for Limerick and its hinterland.  The figure for Waterford encompasses the city and county areas.  The report of the group chaired by Mr. Se&aacute;n Aylward has referred to a natural geographic area consisting of the city and an area in the county's eastern side as suggesting itself as a wider metropolitan area.<\/p><p> Adjacent counties were mentioned.  The terms of reference of the groups dealing with the unification process specifically instructed them to have regard to the need to develop arrangements, be they service level agreements or agency arrangements, to deal with the overspill from city areas into adjoining areas.  The report of the Waterford group highlights the benefit of drawing up planning strategies, for example, retail strategies that take account of the influence of adjacent counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2012102300021#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Conlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351008300,"counter":909,"content":"<p>I failed to get an answer to my question on the large reduction in the number of councillors.
