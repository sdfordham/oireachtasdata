The current role of the Committees is to assist the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in improving and expanding the quality of childcare services available to parents in their area.  The Committees offer information and guidance locally on a wide variety of services including advice on establishing a childcare business, organising childcare information sessions, and supporting parents by providing information on local facilities and parent networks. The Committees also have a significant role in the delivery of a range of childcare support programmes which are currently implemented by my Department.<\/p><p>  Each Committee submits an annual implementation plan which outlines its strategy for the year and the annual funding level is determined on the basis of this plan.  The implementation plan provides for a range of activities to be undertaken by the committees and identifies locally focused initiatives which are designed to address specific local needs. In 2014, a total of  just over &euro;10 million has been allocated.<\/p><p>  The Committees have played an important role in the development of childcare services throughout the country since their introduction in 2001.  They have worked closely with this Department and previously with the Office of the Minister of Children in co-ordinating the increase in the number of child care places in their areas.  The introduction of the additional support programmes and the expansion of the existing programmes have significantly increased the work load undertaken by the Committees.<\/p><p>  The Committees will continue to play a key role in the ongoing development of childcare services and will have a central role in supporting the implementation of new and emerging childcare policy developments, including in the area of quality improvements. Future developments with respect to Childcare Committee can be further considered in the context of the establishment, this year, of a new National Quality Support Service for early years and childcare services, which form a key objective of my 8 point agenda to improve quality standards in early yeas and childcare services.<\/p><p>  Increasingly, the Department works collectively with the Committees and also with other bodies such as the Child and Family Agency and Pobal to ensure effective delivery of services and to avoid duplication. In this context, the Committees have established a representative body, Childcare Committees Ireland to contribute to better co-ordination of the work of the Committees.  This group meets regularly with my Department and with Pobal to progress developments and ensure consistency and is a significant contributor to collaborative working in the early years sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700012#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":8,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, answered orally<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Children in Care","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700012#WRA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[14014\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700012#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the current number of children in high support units and in special care units with a breakdown based on the number of children accommodated in each unit; the way she could state that no child was waiting for a special care place as of her reply to Parliamentary Question No. 13 of 12 February 2014 when she indicated in her supplementary reply to Parliamentary Question No. 716 of 15 January 2014 that 12 children had been approved and were awaiting a special care placement.","asker":"1020","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>Children who are unable to live with their parent(s) for their welfare and protection are taken into the care of the Child and Family Agency and placed mainly in foster care. Less than 1% of children in care with specialised needs are placed in a High Support or Special Care Unit. <\/p><p>  The Child and Family Agency informed my Department on 16th January 2014, that revised arrangements for the management of cases under consideration for a special care placement were being implemented. The reason for the change was that the Agency found the circumstances for some children on the waiting list had changed quite radically and this distorted their priority need for a special care placement. An example was where a child was sent to a detention school for a specified period and was therefore no longer in immediate need of a special care  placement. Other cases included where  a child's situation improved, having been  provided with supports in their placement, and they were no longer in  need of a place in special care.  Children who were on remand or detention or on the waiting list for longer than 8 weeks prior to the new arrangements were removed to allow each social worker to reassess the child's risk profile. In order to be reconsidered for a special care placement, the reassessment must provide evidence to the Admissions Committee that the young person again meets the criteria for Special Care. The practice where a social worker sought a prioritised place on the waiting list, in case the child's situation in their current placement deteriorated, but there was no immediate need identified was also discontinued. These new measures, which were introduced with immediate effect, reduced the waiting list to zero pending the undertaking of  reassessments. As I informed the Deputy on 12th February 2014, I was advised by the Agency that there was no child awaiting a placement in Special Care at that time.  I am informed that there were two children waiting for placement in Special Care on 21st March 2014. <\/p><p>  The Agency advised that as of the 21st March there were 17 children in the three Special Care Units - ten are in Ballydowd, four in Gleann Alainn and three in Coovagh House.

The majority of cases reported on to date were in Dublin. <\/p><p>  The report provides an account of the sad and sometimes tragic circumstances  of children's lives, the work of the Agency in providing for their welfare and protection and the role of the courts  in deciding on applications for the various orders.<\/p><p>  The Project published Child Care Statistics for 2012 that are gathered by the Courts Service.  These statistics show the court activity with respect to the numbers and types of applications being heard in Dublin and in 34 courts around the country and that the volume of applications varies greatly between towns of similar size.   The figures relate to the number of orders rather than the number of children in care.  There are no significant discrepancies in the number of children in care across the local areas. National data at 31\/12\/12, shows that 42% of children were in care by way of voluntary agreement with parent(s), 46% were under a Care Order, 9% were under an Interim Care Order and 2% under an Emergency Care Order.<\/p><p>  The largest single category of application was for Interim Care Orders.

There are currently 93 contracting states to this Convention. Ireland ratified the Convention on 1st November 2010. Ireland strongly supports the principles of the Convention, which strengthen protections for children, birth parents, and prospective adoptive parents in the adoption process. The Convention provides a framework for Convention countries to work together to ensure that adoptions take place in the best interests of children and to prevent the abduction, sale, or trafficking of children in connection with intercountry adoption. The Convention requires authorities to prioritise the improvement of domestic systems for the care and adoption of children.  This is in line with Article 21 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has also ratified. The increasing international recognition and commitment to the Hague Convention, particularly amongst a growing number of developing countries, is extremely welcome in providing safeguards for adoption processes and for those children whom are now benefiting from improved child welfare, protection and care arrangements in their own countries.<\/p><p>  Under current Irish legislation, applicants who seek an assessment as to their eligibility and suitability to adopt are entitled to that assessment from the Child and Family Agency. The assessment leads to an application to the Adoption Authority for a Declaration of Eligibility &amp;amp; Suitability to Adopt. If the applicants are found to be eligible and suitable, then a Declaration is issued. A declaration allows an applicant to apply to adopt, it is not a guarantee that an adoption will take place. It is now a reality that the numbers of children available for intercountry adoption has fallen worldwide. For example, total number of children adopted into the top twelve receiving states in 2004 was 43,142. In 2011, this figure had dropped to 21,911 or by some 50 per cent.  The Adoption Authority can only authorise placement of children with applicants where the children are available for adoption and have been referred by the sending country in question.<\/p><p>  Significant work is under way with suitable countries where there is potential to promote closer cooperation in intercountry adoption matters.  Following Vietnam's ratification of the Hague Convention Ireland was the first country to conclude an administrative agreement relating to intercountry adoption. A similar agreement has been put in place with the United States.  The Adoption Authority is currently engaging with a number of other Hague Convention countries in relation to intercountry adoptions including the Central Authority for India, China, Thailand and the Philippines.  Haiti is due to enter into the Hague Convention next month and a delegation from the Adoption Authority will visit there next week.  I am also aware that Ethiopia is currently seeking to bring its adoption standards up to those required under the Hague Convention and I have asked the Adoption Authority to keep me updated on the position. It is important to recognise that, although a country may be a member of Hague, legal and administrative obstacles may remain, there may be no children available for adoption or restrictions may be set in relation to the categories of children or prospective adoptive parents qualifying for intercountry adoption.<\/p><p>  The Adoption Act, 2010 requires that adoptions from countries which have not ratified the Hague Convention can only take place where there is a bi-lateral agreement in place or under certain transitional arrangements which applied to certain prospective adoptive parents who had commenced the adoption process before the Adoption Act came into effect.  Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention.  However, my Department is continuing its discussion with the Russian authorities with a view to exploring the possibilities of establishing a bi-lateral agreement. I visited Russia in September of last year in this regard and my Department and the Adoption Authority subsequently hosted a visit from the Russian authorities. Official discussions are continuing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700013#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ombudsman for Children Remit","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700013#WRB01000"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[14200\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700013#WRB01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"her plans to extend the powers and remit of the Ombudsman for Children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that I have already made significant changes to the remit of the Ombudsman for Children and have no immediate plans to further extend the powers and remit of the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman for Children produced a report in March 2012 entitled <i>&lsquo;A Report by the Ombudsman for Children on the operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002&rsquo;.  <\/i>This was in accordance with her role under Section 7 of the 2002 Act to review the operation of the legislation and she laid the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with Section 13 of the Act.

As a result of amendments contained in sections 4 and 22 of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 any reviewable agency which comes under the remit of the Ombudsman will now automatically come under the remit of the Ombudsman for Children.

My Department has commissioned and funded a research project which is being conducted by University College Cork and which is looking at the impact of commercialisation and sexualisation of children in Ireland. This important research is currently undergoing peer review and is expected to be published before the Summer.<\/p><p>  In addition, I can confirm that my Department has commissioned the Centre for Effective Services to undertake an international review of other countries' responses to these issues, which will build on the University College Cork research project, and which I would hope will inform the Government's response and future actions.<\/p><p>   I believe there is a strong role for civil society and public opinion leaders in highlighting the dangers of child beauty pageants and I very much welcome the cross party Seanad motion on this issue to which the Government gave its support. The answer is not always legislative and I would note that legislative proposals in France on banning pageants ran into difficulties in light of criticisms regarding the vagueness around the specifics of what types of events were addressed. I also believe this issue must be seen in the context of the broader sexualisation and commercialisation of children.  As part of my efforts to tackle these broader problems, in 2012 I extended an invitation to the Irish retail sector to respond to increasing concerns about the sexualisation of childrenswear. Retail Ireland, responded to my call and accepted my invitation to bring forward Ireland&rsquo;s first ever guidelines on the 'responsible retailing of childrenswear'.<\/p><p>  These guidelines are not just about restricting what retailers can sell, but instead provide a more constructive guidance on best practice on a range of issues such as styling, slogans, age-appropriateness, size, labelling and marketing.

The Programme for Government commits the Government to promoting greater coordination and integration of delivery of services to the Traveller and migrant community across Government, using available resources more effectively to deliver on principles of social inclusion, particularly in the area of Traveller education.<\/p><p>  The National Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework, which I plan to launch shortly, will cover the seven year period from 2014 to 2020 and will address Government commitments in relation to Traveller and migrant children.<\/p><p>  Eighteen youth projects receive funding targeted at young travellers, separated children seeking asylum and young refugees. These projects offer a wide range of programmes and services aimed at young people at risk of early school-leaving, truancy, social exclusion, substance misuse and involvement in crime. Funding for these projects in 2014 will amount to approximately &euro;1.6 million. In addition in 2014 over &euro;0.2 million is being provided to INVOLVE, formerly known as the National Association of Traveller Centres, under the Youth Service Grant Scheme.<\/p><p>  With regard to education, through its various interventions in the education sector, the Government is committed to improved retention rates, better learning experiences and improved outcomes for all children, including children who are members of the Travelling and migrant community. Recorded overall Traveller participation rates in education in recent years has shown a steady increase, as do rates for participation in the junior cycle and for progression to senior cycle. The new Child and Family Agency also has a role to play in the context its statutory remit for services previously provided by the National Educational Welfare Board, relating to educational welfare and school completion.<\/p><p>  For separated children seeking asylum, the Child and Family Agency has a national operational policy on the standards and services to be provided. The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum vis a vis all children at risk and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, practices, priorities, standards or protocols for such children. In April 2013, a report commissioned from Barnardos and entitled &quot;Foster Care and Supported Lodgings for Separated Asylum Seeking Young People in Ireland: The views of children, carers and stakeholders&quot; was launched. The research showed that enormous improvement had been made in terms of the care being provided to separated children.<\/p><p>  On the subject of immigrant integration, the Government decided to commence a review of the current integration strategy with the intention of developing a modern, cross-Departmental policy for the coming years, encompassing a whole of Government approach. A high level committee has been established under the auspices of the Department of Justice and Equality, and an official from my Department attended its inaugural meeting yesterday. My Department is also represented on the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee, which is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700013#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Complaints Procedures","counter":41,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700013#WRB02400"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[14002\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700013#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the steps that are open to an adult who was the victim of sexual abuse and had that abuse compounded by inadequate child protection decision made by personnel who remain in a senior position within the Health Service Executive.","asker":"1015","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":43,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) operates a formal complaints procedure, where a service user who is not satisfied with the service received may make a complaint to the HSE.

This area of services, representing a very small number of children in care, is also the most challenging. The report outlined the importance of good care planning and the availability of special placements for children who need them. The findings of the report show the need for improved assessment, care planning and early access to therapy for children with high level needs.<\/p><p>  A number of recommendations for both the Child and Family Agency and my Department are included in the report. It is worth noting that there has already been progress in a number of these areas in recent years, with further work currently underway.<\/p><p>The new Child and Family Agency, which was established on 1 January  brings a dedicated focus to child protection\/welfare and family supports; to oversee further service developments and reforms. A new service delivery framework has been introduced involving a national approach to case assessment and management. Children and families identified as having welfare needs can be quickly diverted to family support services, allowing social workers to assess and respond to child protection concerns in a timely fashion. A new streamlined management system and quality assurance framework is being also implemented by the Agency.<\/p><p>  The Agency is developing a  National Child Protection Notification System, which will give social workers, emergency departments and Garda&iacute; timely access to information on child protection history. The National Child Care Information System, to manage information on children in care, is now at implementation phase and being rolled-out by the Agency. A comprehensive strategic plan for residential care is also being developed by the Agency.  A new supervision policy for social work staff was implemented in 2013.<\/p><p>  National Standards for Child Protection &amp;amp; Welfare Services were published in 2012. The Health Information and Quality Authority commenced inspection of the HSE Child and Family Social Work Services against these standards in late 2012 and inspections of these services in the Agency are continuing.<\/p><p>  The Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group is continuing to support the on-going implementation of Children First; with legislation to place aspects of Children First guidance on a statutory foot to be published shortly.<\/p><p>  The Ombudsman's report also found that multiple placements were a feature in some of the 10 cases described in the report. I note that in December 2012, 172 children (2.7 % of children in care) had experienced three or more placements in the previous year.  The comparable rate for England and Wales stands at 10% per annum.<\/p><p>  It is imperative that to be successful in improving the delivery of children&rsquo;s services that lessons are learned from the past and recommendations are implemented.   The wide ranging reform programme that has been undertaken to date and continues in the  Child and Family Agency will address many of the problems highlighted in this report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":79,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Shannon Airport Facilities","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[14493\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if any of the hellfire missiles were transported through Shannon Airport by the US Air Force over the past few weeks during the US's transportation of a total of 100 missiles to Iraq from the US; if he will confirm whether several US Air Force Hercules C130 aircraft were refuelled at Shannon Airport during this period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The policy has been implemented on a gradual basis over the intervening years and I regret that it is not possible in the time available to give a detailed chronological narrative as to when each development took place. There are a number of types of Ireland House which include our diplomatic and consular missions abroad and the offices of state agencies operating from the same premises.

The establishment of the Review Group was in the context of the Export Trade Council (ETC), which I chair, given its role in overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the Strategy. As the Deputy will be aware, the Council brings together the relevant Government Ministers and Departments, State agencies and private sector members.  The review was launched on the 24 February 2014 and a copy of the document has been circulated to all members of the Oireachtas.   <\/p><p>  The review was considered by the ETC on two occasions: a progress report at the fifth meeting on 7 November 2013 and I presented the completed review document at the sixth meeting of the ETC on 6 February 2014, after the review was noted by Government.  The review was also discussed by a working group under the heading &ldquo;<i>Ireland&rsquo;s Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy - Toward a Renewed Approach&rdquo;<\/i> at the Global Irish Economic Forum in October 2013.<\/p><p>  The review is the product of a comprehensive process of consultation with local market teams and our Embassy network, with Departments and State agencies at home and with the private sector.  It is designed to ensure that the resources of the State &ndash; both the Embassy network and State agencies &ndash; are positioned to take full advantage of new opportunities in key emerging markets and to keep delivering in our established markets. <\/p><p>  The review provides an update to our numerical targets and re-aligns our list of priority sectors so that they are aligned with the Action Plan for Jobs.  It also introduces a &lsquo;new market approach&rsquo;, which disaggregates the list of our priority markets and includes additional high potential and exploratory markets to ensure that Ireland also engages with high growth markets in Asia, South America and Africa. In order to achieve our targets, the review provides a revised &lsquo;action plan model&rsquo;, which recognises the responsibility of Government to provide the best possible platform for companies and State agencies to win business overseas.  These changes emphasise the positive benefits that accrue through maximising the coordination between Embassies and State agencies in the field and our coordination at home. <\/p><p>  The implementation of the Strategy and the modifications encompassed by this review will continue to be overseen by the ETC, which provides an effective framework for coordination and consultation.  The review provides further guidance and promotes a shared understanding of in-market developments across the diverse range of entities involved, while recognising that they each have their own specific goals, targets and priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD01500","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Finance","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Stress Tests","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD01550"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[14458\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide a list of all Irish banks that will be subjected to stress tests by the ECB.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>As the deputy will be aware the ECB issued its first note on the Comprehensive Assessment on 23 October 2013 which confirmed that\u00a0the following banks are included as Irish banks subject to the assessment:<\/p><p>  Allied Irish Banks plc\u00a0<\/p><p>  Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited\u00a0<\/p><p>  Permanent tsb plc.\u00a0<\/p><p>  The Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland\u00a0<\/p><p>  Ulster Bank Ireland Limited<\/p><p>  The details of the announcement can be found at\u00a0 <\/p><p>It should also be noted that other banks which operate in Ireland and which have a parent within the Eurozone will be assessed as part of the assessment of the\u00a0parent company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":96,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD01750"},{"type":"question","counter":97,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[14464\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700015#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason there was a reduction in tax credits in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":98,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the original Tax Credit Certificate for 2014, issued to the taxpayer, included a personal tax credit of &euro;3,150.

The facts around this have been confirmed by the management team.\u00a0 \u00a0The proposed receiver advised that, if appointed by NAMA, he would be legally obliged to consider the new bid, since he has a statutory obligation to secure the best price reasonably obtainable for the secured assets at the time of their sale.\u00a0Media reporting of the emergence of this further bid caused concern among suppliers and trade creditors, which the Directors of Staunton Sports brought to NAMA s attention.\u00a0 Having regard to the deteriorating condition of the business and the company s insolvent position, and based on legal advice, NAMA and the Directors of Staunton Sports decided that Examinership was an alternative option, which would permit all bids to be considered while the Company was under the protection of the High Court.\u00a0 NAMA is funding the company during the Examinership process, which includes funding the payment of suppliers and staff wages.<\/p><p>  \u00a0I note the statement in the past week from the Directors of the company, which acknowledges the support of NAMA in the current Examinership process and states the Board s confidence that the current process will deliver best results for all the stakeholders.<\/p><p>  \u00a0As the Deputy will be aware, NAMA is obliged by Section\u00a010 of the\u00a0NAMA Act to obtain\u00a0the\u00a0best achievable return for the taxpayer. However, NAMA attaches a very high priority to the preservation of jobs in any businesses that have loans with the Agency.\u00a0 As evidence of this, NAMA, through the deployment of working capital, is directly supporting 15,000 jobs in Ireland in trading businesses linked to its loans.\u00a0 The sectors involved include property, hotel and leisure, retail, healthcare, manufacturing and agriculture.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700016#WRE00300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"IBRC Legal Cases","counter":103,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700016#WRE00350"},{"type":"question","counter":104,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[14515\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700016#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will play any role in the selection of an independent person by the special liquidators of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation tasked with deciding whether or not legal action should be taken against KPMG in relation to its role as auditor of Irish Nationwide bank between 2006 and 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":105,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[14516\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700016#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"by what measurement the independence of the independent person selected by the special liquidators of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation tasked with deciding whether or not legal action should be taken against KPMG in relation to its role as auditor of Irish Nationwide bank between 2006 and 2009 will be judged.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[14517\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700016#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider the appointment of conflict liquidators in relation to potential litigation against Irish Nationwide Building Society's auditors KPMG whereby the special liquidator could make an application to the court for the appointment of independent conflict liquidators to take charge of all matters relating to litigation with KPMG only.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[14518\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700016#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views that a conflict of interest could exist in the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation which could necessitate the appointment of a conflict liquidator in view of the links between the special liquidators and KPMG; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 to 46, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>\u00a0I\u00a0have been\u00a0advised that the Special Liquidators\u00a0are still in the process of putting in place a robust mechanism for managing any potential conflicts of interest that may arise in relation to these proceedings.

Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.   Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim. <\/p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme. The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.<\/p><p>  The Department has contacted primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.

Pupils who have care needs may receive access to Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support in schools. Many children with Down syndrome have access to such SNA support.   Other supports include provision for Assistive Technology support which can ensure that educational materials can be provided in accessible formats.  <\/p><p>  With regard to the admissions process to schools, on 25th March, the Government approved the drafting of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2014. This new legislation aims to ensure that the enrolment process in all primary and post-primary schools is inclusive, transparent and fair. Among the provisions in the new Bill, will be a requirement for all schools to make an explicit statement in their admissions policy that they will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability.<\/p><p>  In relation to admission to higher education, the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) is a college and university admissions scheme which offers places at reduced points to school leavers with disabilities.  Eighteen higher education institutions are currently participating in the scheme. For further information on DARE see also www.accesscollege.ie. <\/p><p>To assist pupils to then attend third level education, core funding for access programmes for pupils with disabilities is allocated each year as part of the overall budget of each designated higher education institution. This funding supports the provision of dedicated staff, services and supports for students with disabilities.<\/p><p>  Every further and higher education institution has at least one member of staff with responsibility for liaising with students with disabilities, as required by the Disability Act 2005. In addition, many institutions have a dedicated Disability Support Service with trained disability officers, learning support officers and other specialist staff.

Details of the reasonable accommodations that can be made for pupils with special educational needs is available at www.examinations.ie.  <\/p><p>In relation to standardised testing, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment guidelines on  &quot;Assessment in the Primary School Curriculum &ndash; Guidelines for Schools&quot;  provides general guidance for schools including on using alternative tests in relation to the standardised testing of pupils in primary schools.<\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the recent NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs recommended that under a proposed new allocation model, all children, including those with Down syndrome, should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. An NCSE Working Group has been charged with developing proposals for a new allocation model. Any changes to the current allocation model will therefore be considered in the light of the recommendations of the report of this Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700018#WRG01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Fees","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700019#WRH00150"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[14559\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700019#WRH00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on the position of emigrants hoping to return home to enter full-time third level education and whether he will put in place a policy to accommodate their needs; his views on correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The investment ensures that the Waterford facility, which currently employs approximately 500 people, can produce the company's latest products and provides an indication of the Waterford site's value to the company.

The objective of each mission, e.g. Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, Education, Innovation etc., influences the form of Ministerial participation, that now frequently involves Ministers from across Government.

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.  There are currently approximately 8,900 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;17.9 million for in 2014.<\/p><p>  The Government's strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas:<\/p><p>- Lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrowers;<\/p><p>- A social housing response (Mortgage to Rent);<\/p><p>- Comprehensive advice to borrowers;<\/p><p>- Personal Insolvency Reform. <\/p><p>In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem and provides little incentive for the lender to provide sustainable solutions.  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) which explores the various options available to the person and provides sustainable solutions.<\/p><p>  As part of the fiscal adjustment required for Budget 2014, provision was made for the discontinuation of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants from 1 January 2014. Existing customers are not affected by this measure and may retain entitlement to the scheme, up to 1st January 2018.  However, it would be expected that during this four year period, existing customers would no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, namely the Mortgage to Rent scheme.

The responses provided were responses appropriate to the details sought.<\/p><p>  Some of the apparent difference also relates to the specific request in the first PQ for the <i>full value<\/i> of certain contracts, i.e. those put in place since May 2011, compared to the request for <i>amounts paid in a given period<\/i>  , i.e. since February 2011, in the second PQ.<\/p><p>  In addition, there are a number of recipients listed on PQ 12586\/14 that are not included on PQ 6461\/14 as the relevant contracts were awarded <i>prior to May 2011<\/i>  . <\/p><p>  For example, the contract value for the General Register Office (GRO) maintenance &amp;amp; development project awarded in 2010, and the contract value for SDM (Service Delivery Modernisation) support &amp;amp; maintenance awarded in 2008 are not included in PQ 6461\/14.  However payments made since February 2011 in relation to these contracts totalling some &euro;11m are included in PQ 12586\/14.<\/p><p>  Full details of the constituent elements of the two responses are included in the tables below.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the engagement of consultants and external service providers contributes to decision making and policy formulation, and provides valuable support for the Department&rsquo;s service delivery modernisation and reform programmes, and that procurement of consultants and external service providers is compliant with best practice in procurement, governance and realising value for money. <table><tr><th>\u00a0Contractor<\/th><th>PQ 12586\/14 <\/th><th>Amount Spent 2011-<br \/><br \/><br \/>end Jan 2014 <\/th><th>PQ 6461\/14 <\/th><th>Contract Value <br \/><br \/><br \/>for contracts awarded post <br \/><br \/><br \/>May 2011 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Accenture<\/td><td>GRO Maintenance &amp;amp;

The Government&rsquo;s introduction of the sovereign annuity initiative provided an option which enables the trustees of a pension scheme to reduce pension scheme liabilities and benefit from the premium available through sovereign annuities over traditional annuities.  I am pleased to see the uptake of sovereign annuities has been strong.  Data from industry indicates that the vast majority of annuities purchased in 2013 were sovereign annuities.  The total premium amount in 2013 was over &euro;400 million which enabled the purchase of approximately &euro;30 million in pensions per annum.  These pensions were in respect of over 1,700 scheme members.  <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">This development is to be welcomed as it facilitates the release of extra funds for scheme members.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Irish pension schemes have the majority of their assets invested outside of Ireland.  As well as providing a mechanism for more prudent investment and a better outcome for scheme members, sovereign annuities deliver a win-win benefit as they ensure the retention of funds within the domestic economy.  This initiative by Government has attracted significant pension fund investment into the economy, with feedback from the NTMA indicating a continuous demand, amounting to &euro;1.377 billion to date, for the amortising bonds used to underwrite sovereign annuities.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700024#WRN00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700024#WRN00350"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[14666\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700024#WRN00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Kildare qualifies for contributory old age pension in their own right on foot of their partnership in their spouse's enterprise as opposed to their current position as an adult dependent; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>According to the records of the Department, the person concerned reached the age of eligibility for State pension (contributory) in March 2004.

The market has developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County including County Kerry can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.  The provision of universal access to phone services is limited to the provision of such services at fixed locations using fixed line or equivalent technologies.  All citizens are entitled to reasonable access to basic telephone services at fixed locations in accordance with provisions contained in the European Communities (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and User&rsquo;s Rights) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 337\/2011).  Any failure by the universal service provider, currently eircom, to meet reasonable requests for fixed line phone services should be notified to the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent market regulator.  The provision of mobile phone networks and services is undertaken by telecommunications service providers operating in a fully liberalised market under licences provided by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Subject to any statutory consent requirements including planning consent requirements, the design of each mobile network is a matter entirely for them.  I can advise, however, that mobile operators are investing significantly in the Irish market. Following ComReg's succesful multiband spectrum auction, three operators have launched 4G services in Ireland and at least one has announced a major upgrade to its 3G network.  During the preparation of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce report, which concluded its deliberations in 2012, service providers noted the importance of planning and consent processes in facilitating the rollout of infrastructure to support the provision of telecommunications services.  The Government's National Broadband Plan which I subsequently published, commits to addressing barriers to deployment in order to maximise investment by the commercial sector and assist in enhancing the quality of services.  Local Authorities have an important role to play in this regard. <\/p><p>  The National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.

In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. <\/p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  I expect that this process will be completed later this year, after which it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country, this map will outline exactly the type of broadband is available in County Kerry. <\/p><p>  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched later in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700025#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadband Services Provision","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700025#WRO00950"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[14531\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700025#WRO01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to roll out dark fibre aurora broadband in the gateway city of the south east region in Waterford city; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.

It is a matter for each local authority to determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution locally, within the legislative framework, including the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter and dog fouling, taking account of its own local circumstances and priorities. Section 16 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986 sets out the powers of dog wardens. In addition, section 28 of the Litter Pollution Act, 1997 provides that a dog warden, within the meaning of the Control of Do gs Act 1986, may issue a notice or on -the- spot fine to an individual believed to have committ ed a prescribed offence under the Act.<\/p><p>  While my Department does not collate statistics on the number of fines issued by local authorities in relation to specific offences, such as dog fouling offences, data is available under the local authority service indicators report on the number of fines issued generally, along with the number of prosecutions and convictions under the Litter Pollution Acts. The 2012 local authority service indicators report is available at the following link: . Penalties for littering offences are already substantial, ranging from an on-the-spot fine of &euro;150, to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 on summary conviction and a maximum fine of &euro;130,000 on conviction on indictment. The maximum fines for continuing offences are &euro;600 per day for summary offences and &euro;10,000 per day for indictable offences.   A person convicted of a litter offence may also be required by the court to pay the local authority&rsquo;s costs and expenses in investigating the offence and bringing the prosecution.<\/p><p>  The Data Protection Commissioner has indicated to my Department that actions taken by local authorities in publishing the names and addresses of\u00a0persons fined or convicted as a result of any littering offence , whether by publication on their websites or by notices published in the local press and paid for by the local authority, would be in breach of the principles of data protection contained in the Data Protection Act 1988 , as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003.<\/p><p>  I am of the view that there are sufficient penalties in place to deal with the issue of dog fouling when enforced under the L itter P ollution A ct s and I have no plans to introduce further legislation at this time. I believe that raising awareness of the litter problem and educating our young people is key to effecting a long-term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal but ultimately, it is the responsibility of each individual to ensure that they play their part in preserving the environment for others through the responsible disposal of their litter, including in relation to dog fouling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700026#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Unfinished Housing Developments","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700026#WRP00950"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[14551\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700026#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will approve funding for a project (details supplied) in County Roscommon under the special resolution fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":360,"content":"<p>Budget 2014 contains a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10m Special Resolution Fund (SRF), to assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments.

It is addressing the persistent issues which have been raised regarding the standardisation of services, communication, coordination and sharing of risk assessment, management and treatment for many children and families with the most complex needs.  It is also tasked with developing a role in supporting families more universally by providing less complex, less intrusive and less expensive responses which have a preventive function. The emphasis is on prevention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic and care interventions which  are key to the provision of integrated multi-disciplinary services for children and families in need. <\/p><p>  All referrals made to the Child and Family Agency are managed through the Standardisation Business Process. Professional risk analysis is carried out by the duty social worker, supervised by the  team leader of the relevant child welfare and protection team. Every report of concern for the safety and well-being of a child is assessed and required action is identified. <\/p><p>  In identifying risk it is the professional judgement of the duty social worker to assess if immediate action is required. This is decided based on the information received on the referral, the seriousness of the abuse reported, the likely level of risk to the future safety and welfare of the child and the degree of professional confidence in the information that either the abuse has occurred and is likely to be repeated or that the child is at immediate risk. <\/p><p>  Where ongoing risk is identified a variety of interventions may be employed through the various systems in place to ensure that children deemed to be at immediate risk are identified and managed accordingly. The level of resource available to the Child and Family Agency is designed to support the approach described above in responding to identified risk and the adequacy of this resource will continue to be the subject of close scrutiny by my Department in consultation with the Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700031#WRU01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse Issues","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700031#WRU01650"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[14653\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700031#WRU01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of reported incidents of child abuse of a mental, physical or sexual nature brought to the attention of her Department in each of the past three years to date; the extent to which existing structures and current legislation is adequate to meet the challenge; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>I have requested information from the Child and Family Agency and I will forward the reply to the Deputy once I have been furnished with this information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700031#WRU01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Safety","counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700031#WRU01850"},{"type":"question","counter":505,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[14654\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014032700031#WRU01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which incidents of internet grooming have been reported to her Department in each of the past three years to date; the extent to which legislative measures to date are adequate to deal with the situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":506,"content":"<p>Whilst concerns have been expressed to my Department by individuals and organisations about the use by young people in relation to social media and cyber bullying, incidents of internet &lsquo;grooming&rsquo; have not been reported, and if there are concerns about this by individuals they should be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>  Internet safety is the responsibility of the Office for Internet Safety, an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality.

The Act provides that persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange GP services for themselves and family can qualify for a medical card. The HSE can only award medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and, therefore, it must assess applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or partner. The HSE gives effect to this legislation through its Medical Card National Assessment Guidelines. <\/p><p>  The HSE is obliged to operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Health Act, while also responding to the variety of circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card. <\/p><p>  Under the legislation, there is no entitlement to a medical card based on having a particular disease or illness (nor has there been previously).  However, if an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds as set out in the national guidelines, the HSE routinely examines for indications of medical or social circumstances which might result in undue financial hardship in arranging medical services and, exercising discretion, may grant eligibility for a medical card on this basis. Where persons submit an application, as a new applicant or a renewal\/review, without additional medical documentation and are refused, they will receive a letter giving a calculation of the guideline thresholds and where these have been exceeded. Also, at this stage, they are informed of the option to furnish further medical documentation, to demonstrate medical expenditure related to an illness or disease, in support of their application. <\/p><p>  Where discretion is exercised with regard to an applicant with an illness or disease, it is the medical costs of that condition on a person's financial situation that is relevant to the assessment for a medical card.  In accordance with the legislation, it is not possible to award a medical card by virtue of an illness or a disease or the severity thereof.<\/p><p>  Down&rsquo;s Syndrome is covered under the Long Term Illness Scheme for which entitlement applies, irrespective of means. Where persons with Down&rsquo;s Syndrome are not eligible for a medical card following an assessment of their means,  the HSE can provide their full requirements in respect of prescribed medicines and appliances free of charge through this statutory entitlement.
