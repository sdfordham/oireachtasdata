A Brexit two-day external consultancy support is also being rolled out to individual clients to help them develop a detailed sustainable growth plan.<\/p>  <p>  EI has also introduced a &lsquo;Be Prepared Grant&rsquo; which offers up to &euro;5,000 for exporting client companies to conduct further research and use external expertise to develop a Brexit Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% over the last two years and they, along with InterTrade Ireland, are offering a range of Brexit focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland.

Improved competitiveness is reflected in strong employment growth across sectors and regions. On the major cost headings, such as labour, property and tax, the National Competitiveness Council has reported in recent years that Ireland is a relatively cost competitive location in which to do business. <\/p>  <p>  However, there is no room for complacency. In the period prior to the financial crash we did not pay sufficient attention to our cost base and let our international competitiveness erode. Nobody wants to repeat that.

The ongoing implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, in parallel with the implementation of the Working Group's Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, will make a difference to the pricing of insurance.\u00a0 I am confident that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from relevant stakeholders, will achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for all and improving the cost of doing business.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800067#WRA01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800067#WRA01800"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[16173\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800067#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the uptake of the Brexit loan scheme for businesses in the first two weeks since its launch on 28 March 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>The Brexit Loan Scheme provides affordable working capital to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees that are or will be Brexit impacted and meet the scheme criteria.

Agency supported companies now employ over 400,000\u00a0people throughout Ireland.  The strong performance of clients supported by the enterprise agencies in winning exports and investment, market share and job creation in the face of intense global competition is impressive and reflects the competitiveness of the environment in which to do business in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  However, there is no room for complacency.

In addition, the productivity performance of many of our Irish owned enterprises is weak and there are not enough enterprises engaging in innovation. <\/p>  <p>  Competition for FDI remains intense. Ireland has many strengths when it comes to attracting FDI scoring highly in terms of criteria including investment incentives, labour productivity and the adaptability and ability of talent.\u00a0 While we have a proven track record in attracting and sustaining FDI, continued success cannot be taken for granted. Our capacity to continue winning such new investment, despite geopolitical changes and intense competition, will be aided by the underlying strengths of our FDI offering.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, my objective is to create the best possible environment for enterprise, entrepreneurship, innovation and investment across all regions.

We are taking steps to ensure the economy is resilient at sectoral and firm level to deal with imminent competitiveness challenges and to build further on the progress we have made.  That is why we are continually examining how we can improve on factors that are crucial to fostering further investment here, including our cost base, infrastructure, the availability of talent and innovation.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025 Renewed - which I launched last month - placed an increased emphasis on developing our Irish owned enterprises.

Real progress has been made towards that target over the first three years of this strategy,\u00a0with half of all jobs created by IDA client companies since 2015 based\u00a0outside Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  An important factor in\u00a0attracting potential overseas investors to the regions is\u00a0the availability of suitable commercial property across Ireland. That is because firms need to identify - before investing in an area - a site or facility in which they can operate from. A shortage of such sites and facilities in the regions has, however, arisen on account of a number of factors. The IDA therefore launched its Regional Property Programme (RPP) in 2015 to ensure there is a better supply of commercial properties outside of Dublin that could accommodate investment. As well as upgrading existing buildings and acquiring strategic sites suitable for FDI, this programme also includes the construction of nine new advance facilities around the country.\u00a0Two such facilities were constructed and completed in Athlone and Waterford in 2014 and early 2015. Further buildings were completed last year in Sligo, Tralee and Castlebar, with more planned for Galway, Dundalk, Limerick, Athlone, Carlow and Waterford. I am confident that the RPP, which has already helped generate employment in the regions, will help secure further investment in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the IDA always does its utmost to encourage its clients to invest in regional area. This includes through bringing firms on site visits outside of our main cities and highlighting to them the particular strengths or attributes of different parts of the country. The decision on where to locate, however, always rests with the business concerned. It is sometimes the case as well that these companies will only consider - because of a range of reasons - urban areas of scale for their investment. <\/p>  <p>  I want to nevertheless emphasise that the IDA will continue to do its utmost to encourage clients to locate in areas that are most in need of investment.

However, at Q4 2017, the unemployment rate in the Midlands was 7.7%; which is still too high when compared with the State rate of 6.1%. We will maintain a focus on the Midlands to ensure that the employment environment continues to improve.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the Midlands of 6% and 1% respectively.

On Monday last I also met with the Chairs of the Regional APJ committees and other regional stakeholders, and together we have started a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020.

More than 690,000 people are internally displaced, and over 546,000 people are seeking refuge in neighbouring countries.  In line with our long standing support to neglected and forgotten crises, Ireland has consistently contributed to the humanitarian response in CAR and has provided over &euro;25 million in humanitarian assistance since 2012, including over &euro;5.2m in 2017.  <i><\/i><\/p><p>Ireland also provides support to underfunded and forgotten crises through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), a large UN fund that is used for immediate humanitarian response at the onset of emergencies, in rapidly deteriorating situations, and in protracted crises that fail to attract sufficient resources.

For 2018, we have allocated just over &euro;707 million for Official Development Assistance (ODA), representing a significant investment on behalf of the Irish tax payer and a clear demonstration of our continued strong commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. 2018 is also the third consecutive year we have increased allocations to the aid budget. Based on estimates in Budget 2018, it is anticipated this level of allocation will see ODA amount to approximately 0.3% of GNI in 2018.<\/p><p>The current Programme for Government sets out our ambition to meet the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) to ODA, as resources permit.  Our goal is to reach the target by 2030, within the timeframe for delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  Progress towards the 0.7% target will need to be made through sustained, managed increments, building on Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in combatting global poverty and hunger, and providing humanitarian assistance to those most in need.  In order to prepare for the managed progression towards the UN target, a new White Paper on Irish overseas development assistance will be produced and published later this year.  Reaching the 0.7% target will involve significant increases to the ODA budget over the next decade and more.  These increases will focus on delivering real and sustainable results, be managed prudentially and effectively, and will require careful planning and consultation across a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including Government Departments, Irish Development NGOs and the public.  The White Paper process will give direction in this regard, as will the recent report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence on Irish Aid.<\/p><p>The table sets out an indicative stepped scenario for meeting the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNI on ODA by 2030, with interim targets of 0.4% in 2022, 0.5% in 2026 and 0.6% in 2028 and delivering on the UN Target by 2030.  <table><tr><th>Year <\/th><th>Total ODA - In &euro; millions<\/th><th>ODA as a % of Projected GNI<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>707.10<\/td><td>0.30%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2022<\/td><td>1,109.29<\/td><td>0.40%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2026<\/td><td>1,560.65<\/td><td>0.50%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2028<\/td><td>1,986.83<\/td><td>0.60%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2030<\/td><td>2,459.13<\/td><td>0.70%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800069#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800069#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[16878\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800069#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on his meeting with the Foreign Minister of Germany; his plans to improve German-Irish relations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":144,"content":"<p>I was delighted to welcome Heiko Maas, the new German Minister for Foreign Affairs to Dublin on 12 April, less than a month after his appointment as foreign minister.

This report will help with the further development GYDP services in the context of the Call for Proposals.<\/p>  <p>  GYDPs deliver valuable services for young people who have committed a crime or may be at risk of offending as well as providing important support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level. I can assure the Deputy that in the context of the Call for Proposals my Department is committed to ensuring continuity of service for participants on GYDPs and maintain a community driven approach to their operation, as well as minimising any disruption for workers and service providers. In this regard, and in line with the overall objective of providing GYDP services to all children and young persons who require them, I am advised that the Call for Proposals will require applicants to provide for continuity of GYDP services for young people currently participating in the service. Furthermore, the Call for Proposals process will facilitate existing service providers forming consortiums, which could apply to provide services under the new comprehensive approach that is being developed. <\/p>  <p>  GYDPs provide an effective and essential support to the operation of the statutory Garda Diversion Programme by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The principal focus of GYDPs is on young people who receive a Garda caution under the Diversion Programme for involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour and are referred to a local GYDP (primary referrals). GYDPs also accommodate a certain proportion of young people who are considered to be at risk of involvement in offending or anti-social behaviour (secondary referrals).<\/p>  <p>  In relation to secondary referrals, it has to be considered if, in principle, it is appropriate to refer a child to a Garda project where no criminal act has been identified. For some, a better option might be referral to available mainstream youth services that could appropriately support them. That being said, it is accepted that referrals to GYDPs must take account of local needs and issues in relation to access and availability of mainstream youth services. Following the Call for Proposals process, GYDP services will still accommodate secondary referrals and the proportion of these may vary from area to area depending on identified local needs.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is very much aware of the range of concerns expressed in relation to the Call for Proposals process. I can assure the Deputy that careful consideration is being given to all issues raised by stakeholders involved in GYDPs, including those of independent service providers, as part of the extensive consultation process which is currently ongoing. This process includes arrangements for an extensive series of meetings with community based organisations and project workers which will facilitate closer communication and exchange of information in relation to these matters. In addition, the consultations will include arrangements to hear the views of young people, including participants or former participants on GYDPs.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the new approach to GYDP provision which is being developed in preparation for the Call for Proposals will not reduce the level of service that already exists, or the importance of community involvement in its delivery. On the contrary, the intention is to build on, update and improve a very valuable service so that it is available to every child or young person in the country who requires it. This improvement to the service will have benefits for significant numbers of young people in the State who cannot currently access GYDP services. While certain aspects of the new service delivery approach have been determined, work is ongoing to complete the full details to be included in the Call for Proposals, which is expected to issue in the second quarter of this year.  I am convinced that community ownership and participation of the projects is an essential dimension that must be preserved and strengthened in the working out of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Enterprise Offices Data","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE00500"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[16188\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE00600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of jobs supported by the local enterprise office in Galway city and county; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1315","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>The Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Galway City &amp;amp; County is the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and &lsquo;soft&rsquo; supports in the form of training and mentoring to anyone wishing to start or grow a business.<\/p><p>LEO Galway provides a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant state supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. <\/p><p>Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs provide financial assistance to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. <\/p><p>In that regard in 2017 the LEO Galway City &amp;amp; County supported 254 clients with 1,039 total jobs which was a gross increase of 192 jobs on 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE00800"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[14015\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the work that has been done by her Department to date in relation to combatting trade deficits which may be experienced by suppliers and companies in counties Longford and Westmeath and the midlands post-Brexit; the number of staff that have been working on this issue across agencies; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the primary providers of supports to assist enterprises within the indigenous sector that are facing challenges arising from Brexit.

New research now shows that the &euro;5m we invested in IBYE has supported over 2,200 jobs and &euro;124m in sales. <\/p><p>In addition, the LEOs have also delivered specific Brexit initiatives for micro-enterprises, including:<\/p><p>- LEO Competitive Fund for Innovative Micro Enterprises: - this new competitive initiative incentivised LEO clients to engage in innovation to develop New Product, Process or Markets.<\/p><p>- Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export:\u00a0 Financial assistance to support market diversification in qualifying businesses to develop new market opportunities. <\/p><p>- The LEO&rsquo;s developed a Lean4Micro offer for micro enterprise clients: Helping business clients adopt LEAN business practices to increase competitiveness. <\/p><p>A net total of 3,760 new jobs were delivered in 2017 by start-ups and small businesses from across the country that have been supported by the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs). <\/p><p>This brings the total number of new jobs created by LEO-backed companies nationwide to 15,000 since the LEOs were set up in 2014. <\/p><p>That is an increase of 10% on 2016 - and the fourth straight year of employment growth.<\/p><p>Growth was evident in each area showing that each county has the potential to grow its own jobs if the right promotion, encouragement and supports are put in place.<\/p><p>A new client portfolio management model will be rolled out nationally this year by Enterprise Ireland to the LEOs, which will support portfolio performance and potential. <\/p><p>The Regional Action Plans for Jobs are also designed to encourage all the players in each\u00a0region to actively support enterprise creation. There are 8 Regional Action Plans and they are underpinned by the &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund which supports\u00a0the establishment of enterprise creation initiatives such as incubators, co-working space, clustering etc. I launched the second call under the Fund on Monday 16 April 2018. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[17062\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE05700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which she is in the course of making provision for the negative impact of Brexit with particular reference to the industries here most likely to be affected negatively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>Co-ordination of the whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being taken forward through the cross-Departmental coordination structures chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. <\/p>  <p>  Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern. This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.\u00a0\u00a0 It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the new Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector as well as additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50m in total.\u00a0 Additional capital expenditure allocation of &euro;4.3bn over four years will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead. There was also increased funding provided to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets. Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams.<\/p>  <p>  Longer-term economic strategies will also be critically important in addressing the challenges of Brexit, notably Ireland 2040 &ndash;the National Development Plan. \"Enterprise 2025 Renewed: Building resilience in the face of global challenges\" was launched on the\u00a09th of\u00a0March and sets out Ireland&rsquo;s medium-term national enterprise strategy. We\u00a0are also in active discussions with the European Investment Bank on a potential increase in investment in the country. <\/p>  <p>  Before the summer the Government will finalise a paper, building on that published in May 2017, on our approach to the negotiations and our latest assessment of the economic and sectoral challenges posed by Brexit and our responses to them.<\/p>  <p>  My own Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) plays a key role in implementing the Government&rsquo;s policies to stimulate the productive capacity of the economy and create an environment which supports job-creation and jobs maintenance. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Brexit, our objective is to support firms to adapt to the challenges and opportunities Brexit presents by ensuring we have fit for purpose policies. Our strategy is to minimise risks and maximise opportunities by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise post-Brexit working across four pillars which are:<\/p>  <p>  - Helping Firms to Compete;<\/p>  <p>  - Enabling Firms to Innovate;<\/p>  <p>  - Supporting Firms to Trade;<\/p>  <p>  - Negotiating for the Best Possible Outcome;<\/p>  <p>  Several important steps have already been taken to prepare our economy, including through a range of measures announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018, as well as commitments set out in APJ 2017 and 2018 and\u00a0the targets included in the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, we are leveraging the expertise and enhancing the capacity of our Agencies to ensure that they are in the best possible position to address the needs of their clients in relation to competitiveness, innovation and trade diversification. This is being achieved through the provision of information, advice, training and other supports. <\/p>  <p>  Specific DBEI actions to date include:<\/p>  <p>  - We are developing proposals for a Longer-Term Business Investment Loan Scheme together with a new Business Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position themselves for a post-Brexit environment. <\/p>  <p>  - The EU Commission has approved a &lsquo;rescue and restructuring&rsquo; scheme. The scheme can be drawn on in exceptional circumstance for a company severely affected by Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0With regard to industry specific responses my Department has already outlined our Brexit Response Plan in &ldquo;Building Stronger Business &ndash; Responding to Brexit by competing, innovating and trading&rdquo; published last November. This sets out our response to Brexit which supports all enterprise sectors. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also commissioned a report by Copenhagen Economics (CE) on the trade impacts of Brexit (published 21 February 2018) which indicates that 5 sectors account for 90% of the possible economic impact. These are Agri-food (beef, processed food and dairy), Chemicals &amp;amp; Pharma, Electrical Machinery, Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail and Air Transport. However, the impacts are felt in different ways and require different approaches. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of Agri-food, Retail and Air Transport the potential impacts will be felt at the firm level, and we are engaging intensively with those sectors. For Chemicals &amp;amp; Pharma as well as Electrical Machinery, small impacts at firm level have a significant impact on the economy given their overall contribution to GDP in this context broad based mitigation the Government is undertaking to make our economy more resilient may be more relevant to these sectors and individual support for companies is not necessarily what is needed. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has an extensive Plan of activity underway, to support the Agri-Food sector through initiatives by the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine, Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland. In the case of Retail my own Department is working with the Retail Representative organisations through the Retail Consultation Forum, which I chair. <\/p>  <p>  The most effective mitigation measure the Government can undertake is to negotiate for the best possible outcome in the future relationship between the EU and the UK. This will benefit all sectors of the economy and the detail contained in the CE study will further help to inform our approach to the negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800071#WRE05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Skills Development","counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800072#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":284,"qnumday":125,"qnumall":"[17063\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800072#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which she has continued to monitor the availability of the requisite skills in the workplace having particular regard to the skills requirements of the high tech industry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":285,"content":"<p>My Department is aware that it is essential that Irish enterprise has access to high-quality, adaptable and flexible talent.

Eight Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJs) were published by the Department between June 2015 and January 2016, aimed at raising employment levels in the regions and facilitating them to achieve their economic potential.<\/p>  <p>  The primary objective of these plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020 and to ensure the unemployment rate of each region does not exceed the State average by more than one percentage point. <\/p>  <p>  The Plans, incorporating over 1,300 actions, are being monitored and driven in each region by Implementation Committees, comprising representatives from the business community, as well as the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, and other public bodies in the region. Many of the actions set out in the RAPJs require active engagement with, and the development of networks within, the private sector. To drive this process, key industry figures have been appointed to act as Enterprise Champions within each Region. Indeed, eight of the nine Implementation Committees are industry led. <\/p>  <p>  Progress across the eight regions has been very positive since the launch of the initiative, with an increase in employment of 8.5% or 118,600 jobs in the regions outside of Dublin and 166,800 additional jobs nationwide, from Q1 2015 to Q2 2017. Importantly, the Plans have been embraced within the regions and implementation rates for actions within the First and Second Progress Reports are over 90% for each region. Final progress reports for the current iteration of the Regional Plans are in preparation and will be published in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies have recorded substantial progress in the past few years. Under the IDA &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy 2015-2019, the Agency is targeting a minimum 30% to 40% increase in the number of investments for each region outside Dublin in the period of the Strategy. These targets have been developed taking into account the key factors crucial to attracting and retaining FDI. <\/p>  <p>  Since the IDA &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy was launched in 2015, half of all new IDA backed jobs created, were outside Dublin. All regions saw increases in IDA employment in 2017, with the South East experiencing the highest growth at 9%. <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, every region saw increases in Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs in 2017, with 64% of new positions outside of Dublin. The West, Mid-West and North West saw the largest level of increases at 7%.<\/p>  <p>  Micro and small businesses supported by the Local Enterprise Offices are making a hugely important contribution to employment growth. An average of 3,750 new jobs were created in\u00a0LEO\u00a0supported\u00a0companies in each of the last four years. <\/p>  <p>  To support the ambition, goals, and implementation of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, last May my Department launched the &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund. This competitive Fund is being rolled out by Enterprise Ireland over the next 4 years to support collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.\u00a0In December last year I announced an allocation of &euro;30.5 million under the first call under the Fund, with 21 projects from all over the country approved for funding. <\/p>  <p>  I launched the second call under the REDF on Monday 16th April, which will allocate the remainder of the &euro;60 million, and I hope to see more successful projects coming through from all regions. I want to see all regions benefitting from this Fund and to this end, I am committed to ensuring that a minimum of &euro;2 million in funding will be allocated to each region once projects submitted meet the threshold of standard set by Enterprise Ireland under the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Building on the progress and momentum of collaboration achieved to date through the Regional Action Plans is my priority. On Monday last I also met with the Chairs of the Regional APJ committees and other regional stakeholders, and together we have started a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. I look forward to working further with the regional stakeholders all over the country to ensure we deliver to the employment targets for 2020 set out under the Regional Plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800072#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Schemes","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800072#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[17065\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800072#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the degree to which the reliance on technology remains an integral part of business and enterprise expansion; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[17068\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800072#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which innovation and technology remains an integral part of new businesses being set up here in the past 12 months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 130 together.<\/p>  <p>  Technology and Innovation remains an integral part of any business, both new businesses getting started and established companies wishing to continue to grow and expand.\u00a0 In simple terms, innovation involves helping companies improve competitiveness by developing new processes, products or services.\u00a0 Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) are essential components in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in the market and increase output.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s annual business results survey notes that Enterprise Ireland clients invested &euro;916m in innovation in 2016 and over half of these used Enterprise Ireland RDI funding and support.

The Fora provide a cohesive education-led structure for employers and the further education and higher education system to work together in building the skills needs of their regions.<\/p>  <p>  - Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN): The EGFSN is an independent, non-statutory body, which includes representatives from the business community, education and training providers, learner-support groups, trade unions, and a smaller number of Government Departments and agencies.  It identifies the skills required by enterprise across occupations and sectors, as well as providing information to education and training providers to allow them to support the alignment of programmes with employers&rsquo; needs. My\u00a0Department, in conjunction with SOLAS, provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support.<\/p>  <p>  An example of the EGFSN&rsquo;s upcoming work on meeting the challenges of rapid innovation and its impact on the Irish workforce is the report on Skills for the Digital Economy. This report will emphasise the importance of the constant reskilling and upskilling of the workforce in creating a resilient economy.  The report will focus on how different roles and different sectors will be impacted by digitalisation and will develop a synopsis of approaches to upskilling the existing workforce. The report will add to the body of work completed by the EGFSN since its inception in relation to filling skills gaps using our current labour market.<\/p>  <p>  Further to this, a number of agencies and initiatives work in collaboration with my Department in order to ensure our workforce is equipped with the skills necessary to meet the growing demands of enterprise.<\/p>  <p>  - Springboard is an initiative under the Higher Education Authority that strategically targets funding of free higher education courses to engage jobseekers to upskill or reskill in areas where there are identified labour market skills shortages or employment opportunities. As of 2018 Springboard offers 208 free, part-time and intensive conversion courses in higher education from certificate, to degree, to post-graduate level. \u00a0All Springboard courses lead to qualifications in enterprise sectors which are growing and need skilled personnel, including ICT; manufacturing; international financial services; and key skills for enterprise to trade internationally.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Skillnets is a state-funded, enterprise-led body established in 1999. Skillnets operates a number of specialised programmes which have played a significant role in addressing current and future skills needs in Ireland. For example, the Future Skills Needs Programme (FSNP) facilitates collaboration between enterprise, academic institutions and industry training providers to develop innovative new programmes that specifically address the future skills needs of businesses. Working in close collaboration with its networks, Skillnets ensure training interventions are relevant to the specific skills needs of participating firms, congruent with the ever-changing world of work, and meeting a high bar in terms of programme design and delivery. <\/p>  <p>  - SOLAS is an agency of the Department of Education and Skills established in 2013 under the Further Education and Training Act. SOLAS functions are to manage, co-ordinate and support the delivery of this integrated Further Education and Training by the Education and Training Boards (ETBs);\u00a0to monitor delivery and provide funding based on reliable,\u00a0good quality data and positive outcomes;\u00a0and to promote Further Education and Training provision that is relevant to individual learner needs and national skills needs. This includes the needs of business and future skills requirements.  The work of SOLAS is vital in meeting future skills needs through the Irish talent pool. Under the Action Plan for Jobs 2018, SOLAS will support up to 6,200 apprenticeship registrations and 3,900 traineeship enrolments throughout this year. <\/p>  <p>  Through the agencies and initiatives mentioned above my Department and the Department of Education and Skills will continue to ensure that that an adequate and appropriately skilled workforce remains readily available to meet the innovative challenges of the workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800072#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800072#WRF02200"},{"type":"question","counter":304,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[17070\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800072#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of countries with which Ireland now competes for foreign direct investment; if she is satisfied that Ireland remains an attractive location for investment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":305,"content":"<p>Ireland remains a global leader in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and competes with a range of jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the Americas.

The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act,\u00a0 the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either:<\/p>  <p>  1. add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine,<\/p>  <p>  2. refuse to reimburse the medicine. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible and within the 180 days.

Since the closure of the Mobility Allowance, the Government has directed that the Health Service Executive should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to &euro;208.50 per month to the 4,133 people in receipt of the Mobility Allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new Transport Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.\u00a0 The Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new Transport Support Scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The Health (Transport Support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the Spring\/Summer session 2018. I can confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new Scheme is at an advanced stage.\u00a0The proposals seek to ensure that: <\/p>  <p>  - There is a firm statutory basis to the Scheme's operation;<\/p>  <p>  - There is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - Resources are targeted at those with greatest needs; and<\/p>  <p>  - The Scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped to bring a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government shortly, seeking Government approval to the drafting of the Bill for the new Transport Support Payment.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.\u00a0 Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,\u00a0 no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.\u00a0 Specifically adapted vehicles driven by disabled persons are also exempt from payment of tolls on national toll roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.

The safety of e-cigarettes is an evolving area of research; while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on its long-term safety has yet to be established.\u00a0 In the absence of additional evidence confirming the effectiveness of e-cigarettes, the HTA recommended that the HSE smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of combination NRT treatment among those for whom varenicline is contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The results of the HTA are informing the development by the HSE, in conjunction with the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee, of national clinical guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  Current evidence-based means of quitting include behavioural support and pharmacotherapies.\u00a0 The HSE provides and promotes these safe and evidence-based services, supports and aids to help people to quit.\u00a0 The HSE recommends that those wishing to give up smoking uses its cessation services as the first port of call.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the emerging research on all products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800074#WRH03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800074#WRH03500"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[16993\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800074#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce cystic fibrosis beds for Beaumont Hospital will be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>The Programme for Partnership Government contains a Government commitment\u00a0regarding the development of a\u00a0dedicated Cystic Fibrosis (CF)\u00a0Unit in\u00a0Beaumont Hospital, to be progressed in the context of a CF Model of Care.<\/p>  <p>  This CF Unit capital project will thus\u00a0be underpinned by the &ldquo;Model of Care for People with Cystic Fibrosis in Ireland&rdquo;\u00a0which is being developed by the National Clinical Programme for Cystic Fibrosis (NCPCF).

The Expert Group also concluded that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.\u00a0 This position remains unchanged.<\/p>  <p>  Medical card provision is based on financial assessment. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.\u00a0The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.\u00a0Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis. Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded. <\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. It should be noted, in certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800074#WRH04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800074#WRH04400"},{"type":"question","counter":431,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[17001\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800074#WRH04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if allocated hours of home help service will be commenced for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":432,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800074#WRH04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Appeals","counter":433,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800074#WRH04700"},{"type":"question","counter":434,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[17002\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800074#WRH04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a decision not to grant home help to a person (details supplied) will be reviewed with a view to making hours available in this case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":435,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

We believe it is essential to address the clear conflict of interest that arises from having sport policy decision makers involved in the anti-doping process. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has a clear conflict of interest and should have no influence or role in the affairs of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).  The status quo undermines the credibility of a system which is failing clean athletes, who dedicate their lives to sport and deserve a level playing field. We believe it is necessary for Governments to take concerted and collaborative action and we are in ongoing contact with our fellow sports ministers in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800076#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1318"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Driver Licensing Service","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800076#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[16859\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800076#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to assist elderly persons that do not have access to computers or broadband to book an appointment for the National Driver Licensing Service; if they will be facilitated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1321","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":511,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

It was introduced in June 2016 and is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department. AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting.<\/p><p>  Level 7 of AIM provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme.  In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room by reducing the number of children in the room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room.  The latter is generally managed through a recruitment process if the pre-school does not have access to a staff member to fulfil this role as is the case for most smaller pre-schools.  Services who intend to use AIM Level 7 support to recruit an additional person for the pre-school room, or increase hours for existing staff, must ensure that such staff hold at least a major award in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications or a qualification deemed to be equivalent.  The is in line with Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 and recognises early years care and education as a specialised area within education.<\/p><p>These Regulations were amended to allow for an exemption to these qualification requirements for an employee of a registered pre-school provider receiving AIM Level 7 support where it has been deemed that specialised health support is required. In limited circumstances, an exemption may be granted by Pobal where it is considered that such specialist support is required and is critical to the child's meaningful participation in the ECCE programme. Such exemptions will primarily be for children with medically complex needs.  The pre-school provider would need to request an exemption during the appraisal process, or once funding has been approved prior to recruitment.<\/p><p>Neither Pobal nor my Department has a direct role in the recruitment of staff for pre-schools which are operated by either private or not for profit entities. While Pobal has noted a time lag for the draw down of some approved AIM Level 7 support, there are several reasons why a pre-school provider may not yet have received a Level 7 payment following approval of such support. For example, the pre-school may need to return or correct the necessary paperwork, the child&rsquo;s registration on the IT system used to administer Early Years funding may need to be amended, or the pre-school may be experiencing difficulty in recruiting staff. In the normal course of events, the recruitment process can take several weeks as the pre-school will have to advertise, review applications, interview candidates, carry out Garda vetting and agree a start date with the successful candidate.<\/p><p>Pobal has received feedback from 10 providers who reported some difficulty in implementing Level 7 support. This included issues around recruiting staff with the minimum qualification, difficulty in recruiting staff to work part-time hours and concerns around staff shortages in the wider pre-school sector. An End of Year One Review of AIM is currently underway which will include an online survey of a representative sample of pre-school practitioners. This may yield further information about recruitment under AIM Level 7.<\/p><p>Overall, in its first year, AIM provided 2,486 children with 4,760 varying degrees of support to ensure that they could fully participate in the ECCE programme. In the second year of AIM from September 2017 to date, AIM provided 3,795 children with 5,900 varying degrees of support to ensure that they could fully participate in the ECCE programme.<\/p><p>Where the 2017\/2018 ECCE programme year is concerned, the following applications have been approved to date:<\/p><p>2,602 applications approved for Level 4 (Expert Early Years Educational Advice and Support)<\/p><p>Under Level 5 (Equipment and Minor Alterations), 255 applications for equipment have been approved and 34 applications for minor alterations have been approved. <\/p><p>Under Level 7 (Additional Assistance in the Pre-school Room), 2,196 new applications have been approved to date as well as 633 applications which rolled over from the 2016\/2017 ECCE programme year.<\/p><p>The report of the End of Year One Review of AIM is expected in Quarter 2 of 2018.<\/p><p>With regard to recruitment and retention of staff in Early Years services, I am very much aware of the difficulties currently being experienced. It is clear that a major issue impacting on attrition and retention rates is the poor terms and conditions of the workforce. These relate to both pay and part time \/ part year contracts. <\/p><p>My Department and the Department of Education and Skills have committed to delivering a new workforce plan for the Early Years sector in 2018.  To support this work, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs commissioned a skills forecasting model from Prospectus Consulting which will allow detailed analysis of skills needs for the sector at a national and regional level.  The model is currently being finalised and will feed into the second phase of the work.  The aim of the workforce plan is to examine the impact of a rapidly changing policy and practice landscape in the childcare sector in Ireland on future skills requirements so that Government can ensure that a high quality workforce is in place over the next decade. The ten year Early Years Strategy which I hope to publish later this year will also focus on how this issue can be addressed. <\/p><p>  Additional investment is required to address the pay and conditions issue. I have regularly spoken about the need to continue to invest both in the quality and affordability of childcare in this country, building on the 80% increase in investment Government has made over the last three budgets. Many efforts have already been made to begin to improve conditions. For example, from September 2018 capitation rates to childcare providers for the provision of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will increase by 7%. The increase in capitation is targeted at increasing the quality of care and education provided through ECCE, and in particular, supporting the recruitment and retention of high quality staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800077#WRL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":561,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800077#WRL01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Banking","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800077#WRL01000"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[16966\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800077#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the status of the public banking investigation; if the finalised report has been submitted to Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to investigate a new model of community banking for Ireland, including an investigation of the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks that operate within well-defined regions.<\/p>  <p>  A project team comprising officials from my Department and the Department of Finance was established last year to progress this commitment.\u00a0 The project team carried out detailed research into the concept of a public banking model, with a particular focus on the Sparkassen model.

It is based, therefore, on contributions under the PRSI system, and not to income tax collected under the PAYE system.  People with no such social insurance record may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), paid at up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  Over 70% of such pensioners qualify for that pension at its maximum rate.<\/p><p>Awarding a maximum rate contributory rate pension to all pensioners with periods outside the PRSI system would effectively remove the pensions-related benefit of paying PRSI, and would also result in very considerable additional costs to the pension system, which would require either very significant cuts either in the rate of payment, or substantial increases in the PRSI and\/or income tax paid by workers, or diversion of other expenditure.  Given that the main beneficiaries would be better off pensioners (who do not qualify for a non-contributory pension) and those who lose out would be people who either are solely dependent upon the State pension, or are working age people (who have higher rates of poverty than those aged over 66), this would be a regressive move, and also one which made the State pension system &ndash; which already faces significant sustainability challenges &ndash; unsustainable in the long term, endangering the future pensions of current workers who are paying for today&rsquo;s pensions in their PRSI and taxes.  I do not, therefore, propose to make the change suggested in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.<\/p><p>PRSI contributions can be credited to people in a number of contexts, for example when in receipt of a Jobseekers or Illness benefit payments. Where applicable, these may be used towards PRSI-based social protection payments, including the State pension contributory.  To qualify for a credit you must have worked and paid at least one PRSI contribution at PRSI Class A, B, C, D, E, or H and have paid or credited contributions in either of the last two completed tax years.  Not all credits are reckonable for a State pension (contributory). <\/p><p>A new Total Contributions Approach to determining the level of pay for recipients of the State Pension (contributory) affected by the 2012 rate band changes was agreed by the Government in January.  Under this approach a person who reached pension age after 1st September 2012 and has a 40 year record of paid and credited reckonable social insurance contributions, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Up to 20 years of a new HomeCaring credit, and\/or 10 years of other credits, for example when unemployed or ill, may be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years<b>.<\/b>So, for example, a person might receive a maximum pension based on 20 years paid PRSI contributions, 5 years jobseeker credits, and 15 years HomeCaring Credits, over a 50 year period.  Invalidity pensioners and, in most cases, Widows contributory pensioners will continue to generally qualify for a full pension.  Instructions for legislation to give effect to this change are currently being set out.  When drafted, the legislation will be brought forward at the next available opportunity.  <\/p><p>Plans for legislation to introduce a Total Contribution Approach for all new pensioners for 2020 onwards will be brought to Government following public consultation later this year. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800077#WRL03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800077#WRL03800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","counter":587,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800077#WRL03700"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[16880\/18]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018041800077#WRL03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he has had correspondence or meetings with representative estate agents bodies on the matter of persons queueing over a number of nights to bid on houses; and his views on whether this is an acceptable practice.","asker":"1276","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":589,"content":"<p>I have\u00a0not had correspondence\u00a0from, or\u00a0meetings with, estate agents representative bodies on the matter of persons queuing to purchase houses.

Recognising that housing affordability is a major issue for some households,\u00a0especially in areas such as Dublin, Cork and Galway, several important\u00a0initiatives have already been implemented to stimulate housing supply at more affordable prices and rents.<\/p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland has prioritised supporting the supply of new and more affordable homes more generally through, inter alia,\u00a0fast-track\u00a0planning reforms and more flexible planning guidelines; &euro;200 million investment in enabling infrastructure to enable access to key development sites; the\u00a0development of large-scale mixed-tenure projects on State lands; and the\u00a0help-to-buy scheme to assist first-time buyers.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2018, the Government removed significant obstacles to building more homes more quickly, by investing\u00a0more in direct\u00a0house-building by the State; removing\u00a0the Capital Gains\u00a0Tax incentive to hold on to\u00a0residential land; escalating\u00a0penalties for\u00a0land hoarding; introducing a\u00a0new\u00a0&euro;25 million Serviced Sites fund and a second LIHAF infrastructural\u00a0investment fund; and providing\u00a0a new, more\u00a0affordable finance vehicle for\u00a0house building\u00a0through Home\u00a0Building Finance\u00a0Ireland (HBFI).<\/p>  <p>  To help renters in the parts of the country where rents are highest and rising, the Government\u00a0introduced\u00a0Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs), where rents can only increase by a maximum of 4% annually for three years. Currently, the measure covers almost 57% of existing rental properties across the country, including 100% of rental properties in Dublin and Cork.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, a further package of affordability measures was announced on 22 January 2018, with a new\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan,\u00a0a new\u00a0Affordable Purchase Scheme, and a focus on advancing cost\u00a0rental projects.
