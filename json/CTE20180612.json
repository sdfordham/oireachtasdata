Owing to commitments tomorrow I have to leave after I have answered any questions members may have.<\/p> <p> My name is Jeremy Percy and I am the executive director of the Low Impact Fishers of Europe Platform, LIFE.  I am also the Chairman of the UK&rsquo;s largest Fish Producer Organisation, PO, by number, the Coastal PO.  Prior to moving into representation I was involved in the fishing industry for over 40 years, as crew - including a spell fishing from Castletownbere for a couple of years in my youth - skipper, owner, fisheries manager and regulator, processor and auctioneer before moving into representation.  The Coastal PO exists to serve the interests of the UK's smaller-scale fisheries sector and LIFE works on behalf of the European small-scale fleet that makes up 62% of the fleet in Ireland, 77% in the UK and 80%, by number, across the EU. <\/p> <p>  The EU definition of \"small scale\" is vessels of less than 12 m, not using towed gear.  The LIFE definition reflects the diversity and needs of the small-scale fleet on a more practical basis whereby our membership, that covers 16 member states and over 10,000 fishermen and women, is made up of fishers who undertake day trips, use mainly passive gears, have the owner on board and land fresh fish.  The size of their vessels varies according to the safety needs and the sea conditions pertaining in their local areas.  Perhaps the best definition of small scale that I have heard is that it is difficult to define but one knows it when one sees it, and that is very much the case for the vast majority of small-scale fishing operations, in Ireland and elsewhere.<\/p><p>Until recently, our sector has not had effective and genuine representation at a policy level whereas the larger scale operators, with greater resources, have been able to influence the policy direction of successive Common Fisheries Policies over decades.<br\/><br\/>It is no coincidence that the current Common Fisheries Policy reform is the first to recognise the value of the small-scale fleet based on the fact that it was the first time that the representatives of our sector were able to contribute to its development, from the Green Paper stage onwards.<br\/><br\/>The other important change I have witnessed is with regard to the wider recognition of and the need to ensure the survival and prosperity of the coastal islands fleet and especially the communities they support.<br\/><br\/>The heritage Bill the committee is considering would provide the vital underpinning policy in support of those island communities around the coasts of Ireland.  It is clear from experiences elsewhere that unless governments act proactively to provide the necessary recognition and practical support, then these communities struggle and often fail to survive.<br\/><br\/>It is worth remembering the boats we are talking about are small inshore vessels which would in all honesty struggle to make an impact on fish stocks, however hard they tried.  These boats simply do not have the engine power, the size or the ability to carry much gear or, indeed, fish.  These boats fall very well within the Low Impact Fishers of Europe, LIFE, definition of small scale and despite vessel and gear improvements over the years can still be regarded as genuinely artisanal in their nature.<br\/><br\/>While this sector may not often show up on an economist&rsquo;s spreadsheet, its intrinsic value goes far deeper than that.  While our small-scale fishermen may not generate excess profits, they are nevertheless making a massive contribution to local employment, the maintenance of families and often vulnerable communities as well as providing meaningful employment in areas where alternative opportunities are lacking.  They are not only the providers of the very best quality seafood, and have unexplored opportunities for adding value in that respect, but their mere presence underpins a very significant element of the tourist experience.<br\/><br\/>There is clear evidence elsewhere in Europe that the loss of even a few small boats can and does have a dramatic impact on the sustainability of tourism locally.  They are also the holders of centuries of tradition and culture as well as the maritime knowledge and skills that once lost will never be regained.<br\/><br\/>The failures of member states to provide the aforementioned recognition and support to their small scale fleet, while understandable in the past due to the fact that they were not at the table when the benefits were handed out, has been recognised by the current Common Fisheries Policy through numerous references to the small scale sector, to provide a fair standard of living for the fisheries sector, including small-scale fisheries and endeavouring to give preferential access for small scale, artisanal or coastal fishermen.  This is all wrapped up in recital 20 of the Common Fisheries Policy that states that small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper.  The European Maritime Fisheries Fund also requires member states with over 1,000 small scale vessels - Ireland has about 1,437 - to develop an action plan for the development, competitiveness and sustainability of small-scale coastal fishing.  This is not just about one sector crying out for support; its particular needs have been finally recognised and enshrined in law.<br\/><br\/>With the greatest respect, the committee has a one off opportunity to strip away decades of unfair treatment of the small-scale fleet in these islands and rebalance the books in terms of access to the resource without, importantly, unnecessarily impacting on the larger scale fleet.  There is plenty to go around but without laying the foundations through the heritage Bill, I fear, and experience has shown, that there will be little effective change to the downward spiral for these island communities and the fishermen therein.

I make this submission on behalf of the members of Killybegs Fishermen&rsquo;s Organisation, KFO, regarding the current discussions surrounding the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017 which is seeking to establish special fishing conditions for fishermen living on Irish offshore islands.<\/p> <p>  KFO fully supports the concept of a special status for island residents whose livelihood is based on fishing and whose permanent residence is an Irish offshore island.  The Irish islands have a proud tradition of fishing and have produced some of our most innovative and successful fishermen for many years.  Many of KFO's members come from such a background and, indeed, are still closely connected with their island roots.  KFO was fully supportive in promoting the special status of islands when the current Common Fisheries Policy was being drawn up as we are aware of the additional and extreme challenges this environment poses.<\/p> <p>  However, I must point out the flaws in the current version of the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017.  The Bill in its current format would be in breach of both European Union and Irish legislation and further promotion without major amendment is pointless and only serves to delay the outcome island fishermen seek.<\/p> <p>  A fishing licence can only be allocated to a fishing vessel; it cannot be attached to a person or group of people.  An island fisherman must meet all the criteria regarding licensing that a fisherman in any other sector does.  The promoters of the island fisheries Bill use examples from around Europe where quota has been ringfenced for specific groups of people but this cannot be done in Ireland.  In other countries, quota is tradeable and often controlled be large commercial interests but in Ireland quota is treated as a national resource and opportunities to fish it are allocated to fleet sectors throughout the 12 month year in such a way as to maximise the benefit to the largest possible number of stakeholders.  It is informed by the quota management advisory committee which is drawn from the relevant stakeholders, including representatives of the inshore sector which includes island fishermen.<\/p> <p>  Within this quota management system, there is provision for fishing opportunities for small-scale coastal fishers, which includes island fishermen, but there is a problem in that those allocations are never fully exploited.  Adding a further layer of bureaucracy to quota allocation by assigning it to a specific group of people - in other words, an island community quota - would not in itself improve the situation for islanders.<\/p> <p>  In its current form the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017 could be very restrictive for future development of an island&rsquo;s fishing industry.  There is a specific reference to vessels with overall length of less than 12 m and not using towed gear which could preclude island fishermen from fishing for species hitherto deemed non-commercial, but which may become commercial, or from scaling up to larger vessels in the event of and facilitated by harbour development and land-based facilities, such as processing, packing for export, etc.<\/p> <p>  It is not clear if this Bill would limit the island fishermen to fishing within the six nautical mile limit of the island where they are resident, that is, the fishermen could not move to other areas or fisheries or use any other gear or avail of seasonal opportunities in other areas if they were constrained by this particular Bill.<\/p> <p>  It is important that any special status being sought by the Irish offshore islands does not, over time, create constraints which prevent long-term development of the sector and have a negative effect on the value of their very important asset, that is, their licensed fishing vessel.<\/p> <p>  A more productive way forward for island fishermen would be to make more of what they already have and look for better infrastructure, and this one of the reasons they are not making as much as they could be making out of their existing opportunities to fish.  There is an enormous opportunity here for island branding and development of their own specialised products and for using what is already available without wasting too much energy on trying to get something that might not give them very much more at the end of the day.

This submission is short in nature reflecting the consensus of my organisation.<\/p> <p>  The IFPO was established in 1975 as the first Irish fish producer, and represents 44 Irish-registered fishing vessels.  Those vessels range from small inshore vessels to the larger refrigerated salt water, RSW, vessels.  Our members are dispersed nationally in that we have members located around the entire coast, some of who hail from, and are still living on, various coastal Islands.  We have discussed at length the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill and, in particular, we have asked members for their views on same.  The consensus is that such a licence would be discriminatory in nature.  Persons engaged in inshore fishing who are resident on an island or on the mainland have the same access to fishing opportunities at present.  To alter this in any way could be putting a fisherman or woman resident in Burtonport, for example, at a disadvantage over a fisherman or woman living on Arranmore Island, one mile away.  This same scenario exists around the entire coast.<\/p> <p>  We have a plethora of policy directives around various fisheries to do with track record.  The inshore fishing industry is currently very well represented by the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, which lobbies and argues on behalf of the wider inshore sector.<\/p><p>To afford exclusive rights or otherwise by way of a heritage licence would destabilise the inshore sector's ability to lobby as a coherent cohort within the wider fishing industry and would, in our opinion, cause fragmentation and infighting.<\/p><p> There is a strongly held view among IFPO members who come from or currently live on islands that the drive to obtain a heritage licence may allow access to commercial fishing for Atlantic salmon in the future.  This fishery has been closed to drift netting since 2006.  The IFPO holds the view that if this fishery reopens, all inshore vessels should be able to enter this fishery and not just those of island residents.<\/p><p> The IFPO cannot support the Bill, as it is our strongly held opinion that it discriminates and goes against Government policy, which aims at managing all fisheries resources in a fair and transparent way.  We have always been extremely supportive of inshore fisheries but we do not see a difference between somebody living on an island and somebody living a mile away on the mainland.  We would like to see inshore fishers getting a very fair deal on the exploitation of resources and quota.  At present, 450 tonnes of mackerel are allocated to line caught fishing.  On average, only 250 tonnes of this is taken up every year.  I am not saying there should be more or less, but it is not being exploited fully.  We have a strong view on it.  We are certainly not against inshore fishers.  Many people in the room know the IFPO has done many road trips over the past five or six years arguing that inshore fishers should be better represented.  We believe all inshore fishers should be represented fairly and in the same way.  If a particular heritage licence affords rights or extra fishing opportunities to one person while denying them to someone else living a mile away, it will be a big problem.  I thank the committee for listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francis O'Donnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation, ISEFPO, thanks the committee for the opportunity to present its views on the Bill.  As with all fishermen and women around our coasts, we recognise the difficulties that islanders face on a daily and seasonal basis in making a living from fishing.  Islands are the epitome of disadvantaged peripheral areas, but this is also true of areas on the mainland, which in most cases are just a few miles or less from these islands.  One could point out that if the six mile zone from the islands described in the Bill were applied in the direction of the mainland, it would encompass and include many more fishing families who depend on the same resource as those on the islands.  In light of this, we fail to understand how anyone can support what could really amount to discrimination against those who reside in equally disadvantaged areas ashore in favour of those who live a few miles away on an island.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of non-transferable island quota is referenced in section 2(6)(<i>e<\/i>) of the Bill.  This is ring-fencing by another name.  Our quota is a finite national resource shared as equitably as possible on a monthly or seasonal basis between all Irish fishing vessels that have an entitlement to it.  Any ring-fenced allocation has to come out of that national pot, so giving more to an island sector means less for their neighbours across the water who fish in the same area with the same overheads.  While we would wish more fish and quota for everyone, we cannot support ring-fencing or giving extra fish quota to any one group over another.  Hence, in the interest of a level playing field for fishing families all along our coastline, we are not in a position to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Hugo Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I call Mr. Murphy of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#H00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Casey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I wish to place on record the appreciation of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, ISWFPO, that the Bill has been introduced by Deputies Martin Kenny, Martin Ferris and Pearse Doherty and that the committee has taken up the Bill with a view to detailed scrutiny of its provisions.  Insofar as the ISWFPO welcomes the Bill, we believe that significant amendment to it may be required to comply with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations pursuant to the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, and to enable island and coastal fishers, who generally reside in very remote communities, to avail of the very considerable discretion afforded to the Minister and Legislature in regulating small-scale island and inshore fisheries, within and outside the structures of the CFP, and within the Irish constitutional and legislative provisions outside of the ambit of the CFP.  I want to make clear it is possible for the committee and the Houses to construct a Bill that would enable island fishers to be granted specific rights to fish outside the ambit of the CFP and in waters that are not European waters, that is, in the inshore waters of the State inside the baseline.<\/p> <p>  To properly scrutinise the Bill, it is first necessary to understand the exact nature of what we, the Irish people, voted to pass regulatory control over to the then European Economic Community through referendum and Ireland's Treaty of Accession of 1972.  The nature and extent of Ireland's maritime jurisdiction, specifically the extent to which Ireland ceded jurisdiction to the EU on sea fisheries within its maritime jurisdiction pursuant to the Treaty of Accession with the EU, must be understood to craft an Act that will underpin economic activity derived from the ocean and confer a modicum of prosperity upon the people who live along our coastline and on our islands.<\/p> <p>  In my written submission I set out in specific detail how it would be possible to construct a Bill in which the House could designate waters within which island and inshore fishermen could derive entitlements to fish that would be outside of the EU quota system.  Once fish are inside a certain line, they are not European fish.  When they are outside the baseline and in the exclusive fishery limits of the State, they are European fish.  In the same way, if we go 200 miles offshore, fish inside the baseline are European fish and fish in the Atlantic are internationally owned fish.  This is crucial for Members of the Houses to understand in constructing a Bill that confers a benefit on island fishers and, I hope, on coastal fishers also, some of whom live in equally remote communities as those on many of our islands.  We also submitted an amended version of our submission, setting out the background and law as to how Ireland's maritime jurisdiction is constructed.  I will deal with what we are asking the committee to consider in the context of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  In the event the committee proceeds with the Bill, regard should be had to the following matters.<\/p><p>All of Ireland's populated offshore islands lie in waters within the baseline and within the internal waters of the State with the sole exception, but I am open to correction, of Oile&aacute;n Thora&iacute;, which lies more than ten nautical miles off the north-west coast of Donegal, with all waters surrounding the island lying within the 12-mile zone limit and within the exclusive fishery limits of the State, subject to the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union.  We believe that specific provision should be made for Oile&aacute;n Thora&iacute; in this Bill, and if necessary that the baseline outlined in the map we have attached to our written submission, and underpinned by the provisions of the Maritime Jurisdiction (Straight Baselines) Order 2016, which repeated the straight baselines order of 1959, would be amended by means of changing the baseline as it passes along the coast of Donegal, so it would pass outside the outer limits of Oile&aacute;n Thora&iacute; and bring the island into the inland waters of the State.  This would place Oile&aacute;n Thora&iacute; within Ireland's inland waters and grant to the people of Oile&aacute;n Thora&iacute; very considerable waters within which to fish, with the distinct advantage that the fish caught and landed from within that zone would not be subject to the provisions of the Common Fisheries Policy, nor would these waters be subject to the movement of enormous foreign-registered sea-fishing boats while conducting fishing operations.  In certain circumstances, island fisherman would be entitled to avail of a special portion of Ireland's EU fishing quotas for catches made outside of the baseline and within the six-mile limit while concurrently being entitled to an almost unlimited access to fish resources in waters within the baseline, none of which will be subject to EU quotas.<\/p><p> Many fishermen living in remote villages and towns along the south-western seaboard, some in places more remote than the inhabited islands, will find themselves at a disadvantage insofar as that while they too will be entitled to fish for catch and land fish resources from waters within the baseline, they will be unable to avail of any special quotas for catches made for EU quota species in waters outside of the baseline and within the six-mile zone.  If this committee is in any doubt it should seek independent legal advice with regard to the status of fish resources within the inland waters of the State and lying inside of the baseline.  Having independent legal advice might be helpful to the committee.<\/p><p> I have set out a note in our written submission that in October and November 1976, during the so-called \"Cod Wars\" between Icelandic fishermen and the British, Danish, Dutch and German fishermen, following Iceland's unilateral extension of the limits of its exclusive fishing limits to 200 miles, and in advance of and during a summit of EEC leaders at the Hague, Ireland - together with France, Denmark, the UK and Germany - extended the outer limit of their exclusive fishing limits to 200 miles from 12 miles in a joint unilateral claim to the fish resources within the 200-mile zones, with a view to putting an end to Icelandic and Faroese pilfering of fish stocks in British waters.  This event occurred six years before the entire international community finally agreed and signed up to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, at Montego Bay.  Ireland and the European Union purported to exercise exclusive rights to all fisheries resources within the waters between 12 miles from the baseline and 200 miles from the baseline on foot of this statutory instrument from November 1976 until 2016, when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, revoked the 1976 statutory instrument and replaced it with another.<\/p><p> At all times since 1976, control over fisheries resources lying in Irish waters between 12 miles and 200 miles from the baseline has been exercised by the European Union on the basis of these two statutory instruments.  This was applicable up until the Treaty of Maastricht when Ireland ceded control to the European Union in relation to conservation, but not in respect of anything else.<\/p><p>We in the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation question the legal and constitutional basis for the transfer of jurisdiction over these fish resources and those waters to the EU through the sole means of a statutory instrument and the consequent grant to give enormous wealth from our waters to the peoples of other EU member states.  I cannot emphasise this enough.  I do not know what is the total value of the fish resources caught within Ireland's marginal jurisdiction but it certainly is a multiple of the value of the fish resources that Irish fishermen derive from those waters.  It could be less than one tenth of the total value of the fish resources that are taken out of our waters every year.  In light of what I have outlined to the committee I ask that members consider that fact that since 1976, the European Union has exercised control over waters from 12 miles to 200 miles but the people of Ireland never voted on this and the Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann have never voted on this.  Nobody has voted on it.  It was simply a statutory instrument done with the stroke of a pen, in a hurry, and in advance of the summit held in the Hague when Ireland, the UK, Germany, France and the rest of them wanted to shove out their borders to 200 miles to stop the Icelanders and the Faroese taking the fish.  I respectfully submit to the committee that this single hole in Irish fisheries law has not been repaired.<\/p><p> With regard to the fish that is within the baseline that island fishermen and inshore fishermen catch, and continue to catch every day, most of this fish is declared against Irish quotas and is subtracted from Irish quotas.  It is taken into account when quotas are being granted to fishing boats.  The fish caught inside the baseline is not European fish.  It is not quota fish.  At the very least, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation calls for Ireland to seek a rebate from the European Union in respect of over-declaration of fish resources taken from these inland waters.<\/p><p> The other issue around the waters from 12 miles to 200 miles is a far larger question that requires considerable, serious thought on a different day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Casey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Casey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#J00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions and submissions.  I will briefly go through each one.  Mr. Percy's organisation Low Impact Fishers of Europe, LIFE, represents a large volume of fishing organisations across Europe and we are very grateful that he has appeared before the committee today.  Mr. Percy outlined to the committee that the small-scale fishing sector, which his organisation represents, makes up approximately 42% of the fleet in Ireland, 77% of the fleet in the UK and 80% across the EU.  I assume by this sector that Mr. Percy refers to boats of less than 12 m, when not using towed fishing gear, which is the provision as set out in this Bill.<\/p> <p>  An issue that has come up against us - and it is a legitimate criticism - is that the quota in Ireland is divided differently to how it is divided in other countries.  In a lot of other countries the quota becomes almost a private entity and it is divided out as a product that is bought, sold and traded.  In Ireland the quota is different in that it is owned in a communal way, by everybody, and that the nation owns it and divides it out as best it can equally among the various fishing organisations and the fishermen and fisherwomen themselves.

Quota management certainly varies across member states.  When discussion verges on what is or is not permitted under the CFP in terms of the allocation of resources, it is worth remembering that Article 16 of the policy says very clearly that it how it allocates its quota is the choice of the member state.  It can be allocated in whatever way the state wishes.  The only requirement is that the European Union is told what is being done.  It does not need to be told why, but it must be told how it is being done.  There is a wide choice of methods for the allocation of quota.  In fact, in a judicial review in the High Court in London, the judge made it very clear that under the CFP if a member state chose, for instance, not to allocate any quota to anyone in the course of a year it would be entitled to do so, although we are not suggesting for a moment that should be the case.  There are a number of methods and it varies significantly.<br\/><br\/>On the difference the Deputy referred to in terms of effective privatisation, in the UK, for example, we suffer significantly from the fact that, because of a variety of reasons I will not go into here, Westminster Governments have allowed the real privatisation of quota, which has resulted in well over 50% of the UK's quota being in foreign corporate hands.  The Deputy can imagine the impact of and the issues which arise from that.  However, my understanding of the Irish quota system, which I will admit is not an in-depth one, is that Ireland has <i>de facto <\/i>privatisation because the quota is effectively allocated to the same people year-on-year.<br\/><br\/>To follow up on the Deputy's second question on the recognition of the importance and requirements of the inshore and small-scale fleet by the CFP, there are specific references in the policy - to one of which I referred - to the recognition of Ireland's small scale, artisanal or coastal fisheries and it endeavours to give preferential access to that sector.  The CFP also makes clear in its introduction that the 12 miles are effectively reserved for the small-scale fleet, although if one asked small-scale fishermen almost anywhere in Europe they would find that particularly difficult to believe as large vessels are allowed, in some cases, right up to the shore.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, I have also seen some causes for concern in the Irish management policy.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published Ireland's quota management policy, dated 2016.  There seem to be a couple of issues with it.  In terms of environmental objectives, Article 17 of the CFP states very clearly that &quot;Member States shall [and it says &quot;shall&quot;, not &quot;may&quot; or &quot;if they want to&quot;] use transparent and objective criteria including those of an environmental, social and economic nature&quot; when allocating the resource.  Within the Department's quota management policy, there does not seem to be any mention at all of any requirement on its part or on that of the producer organisations, POs, to address the environmental objectives of the CFP or the common management organisation.  There is no mention at all of any requirement to carry out regular checks on PO compliance.  Although I stress that I am not for one moment suggesting that the POs in this country have anything other than an honest and upright approach to quota management, this has not been the case when there has been a lack of oversight of PO compliance.  In Denmark, there are criminal investigations ongoing as a result of the handling and management of international swaps that reduced the amount of quota that appeared to be available to the fleet.<br\/><br\/>It is equally the case with economic and social objectives.  There are four producer organisations that have approximately 90%, the vast majority, of both quota and landings.  The four POs here have an majority built into the quota management advisory committee, which effectively hands these national quotas to large fishing companies for free for the most part.  If Ireland does not have direct privatisation, perhaps it has <i>de facto<\/i>privatisation.  One of our main aims as an organisation across Europe is to support equality of opportunity in this respect, as Deputy Martin Ferris suggested, not just by recognising the requirements of Article 17 and the various comments within the CFP in support of the provision of a fair standard of living for small-scale fishers and others, but also in the implementation of those legal requirements.  I think I have probably covered the questions I was asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Percy"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I have one quick supplementary question.

We are now using 19 times the effort to catch the same amount of fish as we did 100 years ago, so of course we have very significant concerns.  As I mentioned in my preamble, we have a situation in which the quotas of the small-scale fleet have been unnecessarily restricted, through no fault of its own, by overfishing in past decades.  The answer to the Deputy's question on the big picture is that we do have very significant concerns about the amount of fish and, therefore, quota available.  However, within that quota system, there is sufficient fish to go around.  If one takes into account the requirements of Article 17 to consider social, economic and environmental criteria within whatever quota member states have, it might perhaps suggest to them whether they want to allocate quota to make relatively few people very rich or to provide a good living for very many more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Percy"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Do any other members have any questions for Mr. Percy?

I acknowledge the organisation raised some valid points.  We understand that a fishing licence is allocated to a fishing vessel.  The fishing vessel is owned by an individual and, therefore, in essence, while the vessel owns the licence, the person who owns the vessel also owns the licence.  One way or the other, we are splitting hairs.<\/p> <p>  This Bill is about providing fishing opportunity.  Every Bill needs amendments.  One of those amendments may be to bring clarity to this  term.  The Title of the Bill, Island Fisheries comes from a committee report in 2014, which stated there should be a heritage fishing licence.  I acknowledge the word \"licence\" may confuse people because a boat has a licence but this is about creating fishing opportunity and the term \"licence\" has been applied because it was applied in the past to it.  We do not wish to mix that up.<\/p> <p>  The point has been made by several contributors that those on the islands who depend on fishing are in a difficult position and many of those living on the shoreline near them are in a similar difficult position.  We all acknowledge that.  We are not trying to give an advantage to one over another.  We intend to recognise that there is a significant disadvantage to living on an island.  The person who lives on an island does not have the same opportunities to access other employment as someone who lives on the shoreline.  I spoke to a man the other day in Donegal town who told me he had grown up on an island and had fished on it as a young man.  He left the island and lived on the mainland where he ended up working in a textile factory.  He stated that if he lived on the island, he would still have to fish because there would be no textile factory on the island.  That is the reality for those who live on the islands.  They are at a geographical disadvantage because of where they live and, therefore, the only economic opportunity that they have, by and large, is fishing because it is the only natural resource that surrounds them.  That is the essence of this Bill.<\/p><p>This Bill is about recognising that.  Not only do we recognise it here, it is recognised internationally and in the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is there in black and white.  We are not trying to disadvantage anyone.  We are trying to recognise the disadvantage at which island people already are and in so doing, to allow them the opportunity to get fishing.  To get the opportunity to fish, the first thing they need is a quota.  My understanding is that to get a quota, they have to have a track record.  For a great many of the people living on the islands, getting a track record is something that happened in the past.  For those of us in this committee who are more used to farming, it is almost like the requirement for reference years.  When people wanted to get the entitlement to farm, they had to have certain reference years.  If someone was not farming in those reference years, they did not get entitlements.  It is almost the same in the fishing sector.  What we want to do is create a situation where there is the opportunity to fish and there is a piece of quota set out for the island fishermen.  It will be organised similarly to the way the producer organisations already organise it for their own members, but giving that opportunity to island fishermen.  The points raised are valid.  We will look at that, and we will certainly look at clarifying the issues around licensing.  We can also look at the issue of quota management.<\/p><p> The Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, KFO, is one of the largest fishing organisations.  It is probably recognised as being the best organised and it has done a great job for its members.  Everyone understands that.  I would like to get a little bit of information on the KFO.  How many members does it currently have?  How many tonnes of pelagic species does it have quota for?  Information like that would be useful to put what we are talking about here into context.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#L01500","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Can I come back in on that point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Norah Parke"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I have other questions for the other witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#M00300","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>We will put all our questions together.

Yes, we want to give an advantage to the island fisherman.  That is what we want to do.  It is the essence of what we are doing.  It is not designed to disadvantage others who live on the shoreline in any way.  It was argued that if a person had access to fishing opportunities on the island, it could somehow run into unforeseen problems down the line.  In other words, they would somehow be prevented from receiving quota in the normal circumstances.  That is not the intention of the Bill.  The Bill does not intend to do that.  Everyone who would have access to the heritage fishing licence would already have to have a licence to fish.  They probably would not have quota, and they would seek the heritage licence in order to gain quota.  That is really what this is about.<\/p> <p>  It was said that giving an advantage to one somehow disadvantages the other.  We all recognise and it is internationally recognised, even within the Common Fisheries Policy, that people who live on islands are already at a disadvantage.  Giving them a particular advantage is about trying to restore some form of equity around their opportunity to create economic viability for themselves and their families to continue living on the islands.  That is what we want to do.  I absolutely believe that the members of the organisations present would understand that.  Many of them live on islands.  Moreover, I am sure that the members who live on the mainland would not begrudge those living on the islands that small opportunity.  I do not think they would, nor should they.  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Boyle referred to the south and the east and the ring fencing of quota.  One could call it ring fencing, if that is the term one wanted to use and that is what we want to do.  We want to give an advantage to the people who live on the island because their very existence on an offshore island is a disadvantage that needs to be addressed.  That is what we want to do and we make no apology for wanting to do that.  Again, the same point is to be made.  I do not believe that those in the inshore sector who live on the mainland would begrudge that small advantage being given to people who are already living in disadvantaged circumstances.  I do not think that the idea that it somehow creates an uneven playing field is a fair criticism of the Bill.  I do not think it creates an uneven playing field.  It attempts to level the playing field for those who are at a disadvantage already.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely take the point about the baseline and where it runs.

I will raise a general question at the outset, one that follows from what Deputy Martin Kenny has been saying.  A number of witnesses have argued that while they recognise the needs and difficulties of island fisherman, there are similar difficulties for fishermen, particularly smaller fishermen, who are on land and fish inshore.  As such, to give particular leeway and specific allocation to island fishermen would be to discriminate against those who are on the mainland but also fishing in the same waters.  I understand the point the witnesses are making.  However, this comes down to the key principle and core of this Bill.  Would the witnesses not agree that there are additional challenges and particular difficulties for those who are based on the islands and fishing from them, and that the opportunities are even more limited there?  Is there not therefore a case for bringing in specific allocations as provided for in this Bill?  I think that goes to the core of many of the points which were made in submissions today.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a couple of specific points in reference to the presentations of Ms Norah Parke and the KFO.  In her presentation, Ms Parke argued that there are flaws in the current version of the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017, that in its current form it would be a breach of both European Union and Irish legislation and that further promotion without major amendment would be pointless and serve to delay an outcome for island fishermen.  Ms Parke says that on the basis that a fishing licence can only be allocated to a fishing vessel and cannot be attached to a person or a specific group of people.  She says that although there are examples of quotas being ring-fenced for specific groups of people at European level, this cannot be done in Ireland.  Is it not possible that this Irish law could be changed, were there to be a will for that to happen?  I acknowledge it is not the way it is done at the moment.  I seek clarification on whether that could change, should the will be there.<\/p><p> Mr. Francis Donnellan said there is a strongly held view by IFPO members who come from or currently live on islands that the drive to obtain a heritage licence may in fact allow for access to commercial fishing for Atlantic salmon in the future.  He indicated that should it be opened again it should be open to mainland based fishermen working the inshore as well as to island based fishermen.  Will he elaborate on why he made that point and where his members are coming from on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#M00900","speaker":"1244","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.

The big thing here, or what is being conveyed to me, is that there appears to be a reluctance to give any of the quota to the island fishermen or the small operator.  I am sure that if everybody got together and looked at the benefits this would bring to a disadvantaged area, most people would consider it a good thing to do.  We have to find a mechanism here.  I understand the concerns and so forth but we could draft amendments to this Bill that, perhaps, would get people over the line on it.  At the end of the day what we are trying to do here is right a wrong.  Deputy Martin Kenny put it very well.  People living on islands are doubly discriminated against because they do not have access to onshore jobs and so forth and are, therefore, very dependent.<\/p> <p>  I was involved in commercial fishing and if my memory serves many of the allocations of quota were based on track record.  Everybody here knows what I am talking about when I refer to track record.  Most people I know who were involved in fishing did not have a track record because they did not declare it.  That is the reality.  They did not declare it for obvious reasons.  They were struggling to make a few bob and if they declared what they were catching they would have had the tax man knocking on the door.  The witnesses know that.  They also know that there was a nod and a wink to people to declare a track record so they would be able to be beneficiaries down the road.  I know all the coastline from Malin Head down to Hook Head.  I fished all those areas so I know the fishing community.  That is what happened.  Some people are very wealthy as a result of fishing.  They are making an absolute fortune from it and good luck to them.  They are multimillionaires.  What we are trying to do here is look after the small operator, and I would like to see another Bill to look after the inshore fishers.  They are equally discriminated against and have found themselves with no quota and no chance of quota.<\/p> <p>  I was very impressed by what Mr. Greg Casey said about the baseline and the fish inside the baseline.  These are not EU fish but fish that belong to the Irish nation and should be for the benefit of the Irish nation.  However, much of that fish is finding its way into being part of the EU quota.  That is a matter for another day, but this committee should certainly consider having a separate meeting to discuss the fish caught from the baseline to the shore. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#N00600","speaker":"1317"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>That is for another day, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#N00700","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Yes, but I am making the point that it should-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#N00800","speaker":"1317"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Yes.

What would be wrong with that?  The witnesses need to explain to us what is wrong with giving a small part of the quota to the people who need it.

However, they must have a vision for the people who are discriminated against and less well off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#N01000","speaker":"1317"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I am not a member of the committee but I wish to make a few points.  Deputy Ferris touched on the main issue here, which is what is called the track record.  It was only in the 2000s that good ferry services were extended to all the islands, so at that time the chances of anyone living on an island working from a base on the mainland were virtually nil.  The second reality is that many of the islands did not have sheltered harbours.  In the case of County Galway there was nowhere on the two smaller Aran Islands where one could leave a boat.  Certainly, most people on the mainland would not call C&eacute;ibh an Rannaigh, the main fishing pier in Arranmore in County Donegal, a fishing pier.  Tory Island did not have a sheltered harbour historically.  Basing fishing on track record in the islands, with the exception to a certain extent of Inishmore in the Aran Islands, therefore just does not work.  On the other hand, an island is surrounded by the sea.<\/p> <p>  We all agree that the Bill can be amended technically.  I do not believe the proposer of the Bill, Deputy Martin Kenny, has an argument with that.  Basically, the big scene ticket in the Bill is that a very small amount of fishing quota would be made available specifically for people living on islands so they do not end up living in a place that is surrounded by water which they cannot access in a way that is reasonable in the modern world.  It is not on a large scale - the very large fishermen can compete commercially - but on a far more modest scale, although not to limit it to what a currach can do with the very limited permissions currach operators have.  Like everybody else, people wish to move forward a little and have slightly bigger boats and so forth.  Under the Bill a limited length of boat would be eligible, so if someone who happens to be on an island has a very big boat, there would be no benefit from the proposal before us.  That was purposely done.  I was a member of the committee that drew up the initial proposal.  What I have heard today, and having looked at the submissions, is that people do not have a problem with this and then they add \"but\".  I always get worried when I hear the word \"but\".  What it means is: \"We would not like to tell you that we do not want you to get a share of it, but on the other hand we are going to make damned certain you do not.\"<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a final point.  In many cases exceptions are made for the islands.  The State recognises the unique position of islanders.  For example, the pupil-teacher ratio for retention of teachers is much lower on an island than on the mainland because there is no option to go to the next school.  Car tax on an island is much smaller in recognition of the fact that most islands only have up to three or four miles of road.  There is an extra social welfare payment on the islands for people on invalidity pension, disability allowance and the State pension.  Again, that recognises that the islanders must bring all their goods to the island and pay VAT on transferring them to it.  The precedent of ring-fencing specifically for islands has been well established for the past ten or 15 years.  To be fair, having travelled throughout this island I have never met anybody who begrudged any steps the Oireachtas has taken to try to preserve viable populations on our islands.  Ordinary people in cities, towns and the countryside understand that if one wishes to preserve the island one must do something special.<\/p><p>It used to frustrate me when I heard so much talk about the Blasket Islands and the fantastic culture that was there, as recounted by Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Criomhthain in <i>An tOile&aacute;nach<\/i>and by Peig Sayers.  What was there was unique.  It is a pity it has gone.  Some days we do not seem to be half as concerned, however, that this same culture, language and literary bent is still alive in places like the Aran Islands, Toraigh and elsewhere.  When these islands are decimated, the indigenous populations have left them and the language is gone, will we be crying and asking why did we not do something small to keep them viable?  That is all we are asking for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#N01100","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Deputies Martin Kenny and Martin Ferris nailed their colours clearly to the mast.  While I respect them for that, my difficulty is, as my colleague said, that we represent people who come from disadvantaged areas, as well as those who have done well in the fishing industry.  How does one disentangle somebody from an island and somebody fishing right beside them in the same area who is extremely disadvantaged?  If one is from south-west Donegal, one will have nothing in terms of employment other than fishing or a little bit of subsistence farming.<\/p> <p>  There is no question about it.  The Government can change policy.  Lately, it changed policy in respect of mackerel sharing.  Several years ago, it changed policy on blue whiting, Celtic Sea herring and north-west herring.  Over the past several years, there has been a scientific fishery plan for North-West herring.  Last year, the inshore vessels got approximately 15% of that.  Not all of these vessels were under 12 m.  Some of them were between 14 m and 16 m and some of those fishermen were from islands too.  There is a policy recognition at PO and national level that more has to be done.  Wearing my PO hat or even politically, I do not know how one can differentiate between people in this regard.  I respect what the Deputies said.  There is no doubt that people from islands cannot simply step off and get a job.  In some coastal communities, however, they cannot go elsewhere either.<\/p> <p>  The CFP recognised island communities and small-scale fisheries more so this time than it ever did before.  However, it did not direct how that was to be played out.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, is in place.  Much more money needs to go into small-scale fisheries in general, not just necessarily island communities.  By small-scale fisheries, I mean everyone fishing inside the baselines in terms of fisheries management, science, nursery areas, marketing and infrastructure on islands and piers.  While the Deputies and I may not be in the same place, I recognise things must be done and the Government can change policy.<\/p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue referred to salmon fishing.  In a previous life, I was a fisheries inspector.  Drift netting for salmon ceased in 2006 after a task force report on it.  At that point, it was perceived that drift netting was the reason for the decline of Atlantic salmon.  It is now accepted that was not the case.  Atlantic salmon continues to decline and it is believed now that it is a marine survival issue.  It is important that for traditional fisheries, such as drift netting and draft netting for salmon, it is recognised environmental and ecological conditions can change.  In Greenland and Iceland, where salmon go to feed, ten or 15 years from now the salmon stocks might start to recover.  It is important for coastal communities to exploit them.  I know salmon is an iconic species.  However, if managed properly and if that fishery comes back on stream, the opportunity should be there for everybody.  Families have traditionally fished salmon from islands and coastal communities.  My members asked me would a heritage licence confer rights if salmon fishing comes back.  That is why I put it into our submission.  I would be open to it.  As someone who comes from the coast myself, we should monitor that fishery in the future.  I hope that there would be willingness at government level that if these stocks did recover, we would open up those fisheries again.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about track record.  That is the case in some fisheries.  However, it us up to the Government and elected representatives to change that.  That is very much in flux.  It has not always changed in the favour of the inshore sector but it has changed in the past two to three years.  The Government's policy is to give more to inshore sector in terms of pelagic stocks.  It may not be happening fast enough, but it is happening.  That is up to elected representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Francis O'Donnell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Regarding what Deputies Martin Kenny and Martin Ferris said, we are arguing for the same but from different perspectives.

One could create a quota for islands in excess of any fishing opportunities they have.  If those islands have not got the infrastructure to translate that into sound economics, they will not be better off, however.  What will the extra quota do?

If landed on an island, at best, it will perhaps be used as bait for crustacean fisheries.  These are the issues underpinning the sustainability of fisheries for islanders.<\/p> <p>  The Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation supports the concept of special status for island residents.  We would give every bit of support and help we could in that regard.  It has to make economic sense, however.  I would feel we would be doing a disservice to islanders if we did not underpin it with proper infrastructure and whatever else is needed, even in the way of information as to what is available.  I spoke to some Donegal islanders before I came to this meeting and was astounded at the number of them who did not even realise they could fish mackerel.  There is a big information gap that needs to be addressed.  We have no problem with boosting the amount of fishing the islands do.  We would be delighted and they would be more than welcome to join a PO and avail of its services.  Everybody seems to think POs have a magic wand for getting quotas for their members.

I return to what Deputy Martin Kenny said about an unlevel playing field.  I worked and fished around every island of Ireland, in small boats and larger ones.  I know all the islanders, many of the island communities and have worked in partnership with boats from the Aran Islands for almost 30 years.  I have knowledge and insight into what happens there.  Most islanders who I know and have met over the years are very proud people.  They are very independent, progressive people and they are competitive.  Many islanders came out and did what they had to.  There was a level playing field then - I will not speak about the track record, I refer to the period before that - and were pioneers in the fishing industry.  It was an islander who had the first dedicated pelagic vessel in Ireland, which they worked their way up to, and the first factory ship in Ireland.  The owner of the biggest trawler in the world in its time was from an island.  One can go to the Aran Islands or Cruit Island, or speak to some of the skippers from Inisbofin who have worked on large vessels and have done extraordinarily well, as have those from Bere Island or the west Cork islands.  We are talking about people who themselves have a proud tradition.  I am surprised that they would seek anything other than a level playing field.  It is true that fishing communities around the coast need some sort of help, possibly through quotas, for instance, but I do not think that they would want a quota that their neighbour two miles away could not access.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Ms Parke.  What quota could one give them?  There is very little cod around the islands and no haddock inside the six-mile zone.  I would be surprised if they wanted to confine themselves to that particular area of the six-mile zone around the islands.  The islanders that I know would not want that.  When I speak of islands, I live on an island and reared a family on one, who are rearing their families on one, so I have some insight, although it is not an offshore island.  That is where I come from regarding a level playing field.  I do not expect someone to lose out from the islanders getting something extra.  If we could go with what Mr. Casey suggested, that would be perfect.  I have many friends on islands and do not want to lose them, nor will I, as a result of what I am saying here because I am being totally objective.  <\/p> <p>  On Deputy Martin Kenny's other point on ring-fencing, that is a dirty word in the fishing industry.  I am glad that the Deputy agrees with my observation that this is ring-fencing.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, things have been ring-fenced for islands before, and obviously that is correct.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Ferris said that the Government can change its rules and allocate quota.  It probably can and if it does so, we will not stand on a barrel saying \"Do not do that\".  The way things are now, it cannot actually do that and that process is not available to us.  On the track record, I admit that it is a difficulty.  <\/p> <p>  That is where we are coming from.

I would classify myself as an islander.  We come from Heir island and our family home is still there.  I started fishing out of Baltimore around the islands.  Like my colleague, I have a great interest in the island communities.  I was one of the pioneers of setting up a V-notching programme around the south-west coast.  The problem, as my colleagues have articulated, is that at present the law will not allow us to give an individual quota to anyone.  I learned this the hard way.  When we established the lobster V-notching programme and looked for protection for people who had put a lot of time, money and effort into protecting their own fishery, even though many of them were not participating in it, when we looked for a licence for those individuals we were told that unless they had a fishing boat licence, they would not give a second licence, which was the case with salmon licensing.  This is the crux of the problem.<\/p> <p>  As my colleague, Mr. Casey, has explained, there is a solution to this.  We, as a country, did not protect our inland waters inside the baseline.  We did not give away the fish that swim inside in that baseline to Europe, it is our fish.  However, Ireland counts it against Ireland's quota which we get from Europe, which is about 10% of the quota.  I see this as a solution.  As an island person I see it as a fantastic way of looking at this.  We can calculate the amount of fish that has been caught inside the baseline in previous years, then tell Europe that this is fish that was logged and caught inside the baseline but should not have come off Ireland's quota because it was Ireland's fish.  We want to do something with that fish now.  The principle of this is to allow the people of the islands to remain on their island homes and access the resource that is around them.  As Mr. Boyle pointed out, there is very now very little of that resource inside the area with different types of fish, so one has to look at the economic sense of what the fishermen in an island community can and will use.  I am confused by the term of giving them 1% off the top.  If they cannot access that 1%, is it theirs to trade or use as a commodity elsewhere?  If, as Ms Parke said, they do not catch it, will they lose the right to that fish because of the fish that swim in the inshore waters around these islands?  That is why I have let this educated man make the proposal to this committee.  Legislators have a very important job of looking after all the communities of this country, including the coastal communities.  I stress that there is an opportunity to examine the legalities of whether we can get back the fish within our baseline for Ireland and change the laws to accommodate the purpose of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I wish to say two things with regard to splitting islands and remote coastal communities.

The policy then goes on to state \"Small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper.\"  However, that says nothing about giving them preferential access as has been set out in recital 19, whose reference to \"preferential access for small scale, artisanal or coastal fishermen\" would include island fishermen, I would imagine.<\/p><p>My organisation very strongly supports the principle of what the committee is trying to achieve.

There were 450 tonnes of mackerel allocated to smaller boats, which they can catch by line or by jigging, but only half is used in the year.  I am asking if the 1% can be dedicated to the island.  If the fish do not swim in the area, it is no good if 1% of fish can be caught around the islands.  Does one swap it for 1% of the fish inside and where one can fish 2%?<\/p> <p>  There are huge complications and there is a misconception about how fish are allocated in this country.  It is allocated by boat size and once a person has a licence and is under 55%, that person can get one third or a half of what the boats in the larger section catch.  We go through all the stocks each month and see what fish were caught in the previous two years and we use knowledge of our own vessels to work out how many will participate in a fishery in the next month.  We try to allocate the crumbs on that basis so that the boats can stay fishing.  That is how hard it is for Ireland to give out fishing allocations to different vessels.  If vessels do not catch their allocation, it goes back into the pot for the following month and we go through the same process again.<\/p> <p>  I have a fishing licence and a small boat and I can catch up to 55% of my category, the same as everybody else.  I choose which fish I catch and where and how I catch and land them.  The licence for lobster is a P licence because we had no track record when we looked for a licence for lobster fishing.  Back in 1985, there was no drive to license vessels under 12 m so there was an awful lot of boats which were fishing but were never licensed by the State and never logged onto the European register.  Some 410 of these boats are in existence today with only a non-quota species licence, that is, for crab and lobster.  There is no management structure for the licence so a person who lives on an island can put out 200 pots, catch that species of fish and land them.  If a lobster boat licence or a licence for inshore potting is restricted, the fishermen may then be excluded from that fishery.  My boat can catch any species of fish that is allocated based on the monthly allocations up to a maximum of 50% of that caught by the boats in the larger segment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#Q01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Patrick Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>That may be something for the future, but we are talking about the Bill.

As the representative organisation for the offshore islands, our aim is to draw attention to the difficulties facing islanders in all areas of island life which were not, and are not being dealt with effectively either at regional or national level.  Our aim is to work to find solutions which are island proofed.  As an example of protecting this way of life, Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, along with its sister organisation, Comhar na nOile&aacute;n, has worked with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to help island farmers engage constructively with island issues.  This work recently led to improved payments under the areas of natural constraints, which now has an islands category, as well as working with island farmers on result-based, locally led schemes for European innovation partnerships.  This is an example of island-proofed policies that have helped secure our island way of life.<\/p> <p>  As part of that ongoing work, we are here today to promote the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill.  Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, along with Comhar na nOile&aacute;n, has consistently asked Government to have fishing designated as a pillar of job creation on the islands, and appeared before this committee in 2013.  Island communities welcomed the 2014 Oireachtas joint committee report on sustaining coastal and island communities.  We see the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill as a logical follow-on to the recommendations of the committee, especially recommendation 10, heritage licences.  This is a simple and effective mechanism to ensure that fishing opportunities are accessible to small fishing boat owners on islands.<\/p> <p>  Islanders are by nature resourceful and, if allowed to, can make the best use of available opportunities.  Small-scale fishing, which is of the greatest benefit to the island communities, is most at risk from policies that promote large-scale industrial fishing.  Those who remained fishing in their island communities have been forced to make a living mainly off non-quota species.  This is not sustainable for our communities or the fish stocks.  The current Common Fisheries Policy recognises the special requirements of small offshore islands and they are specifically referred to in the Common Fisheries Policy, paragraph 20, that controls European fisheries.<\/p> <p>  Comhdh&aacute;il is one of the founding members of the European Small Islands Network, ESIN, and we work closely with islands across Europe.  Through our work with ESIN, we keep informed of the special position of islands all over Europe and of the varied solutions applied to address unique problems.  We have the full support of ESIN in the ongoing work to get this Bill passed into law.<\/p> <p>  To survive, fishing on the islands needs to revert back to a system of seasonal fishing and local management where managed quantities are taken from the various quota stocks at different times of the year.  Having our small-scale island fleet return to seasonal fishing practices will add significantly to the tourism industry, which has become an increasingly important part of the economies of the islands.  The solution advocated in the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill will allow fishing opportunities in the form of quotas to be allocated by the Minister to maximise the benefit of the resource to the maximum number of people.  Allocating the necessary amount to the island fisheries communities will help to redress the decline.<\/p> <p>  Islands work in a different way from the mainland, a point not lost on the islanders who are lectured to by the mainlanders who have left the room.  The current system is simply not working for the islands.  We need to act before it is too late.  Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann strongly supports the introduction of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murray and I call Mr. Early.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#R00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Enda Conneely.  The Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, IIMRO, thanks the Chair and the committee for the invitation to appear and discuss the vitally important Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill.  IIMRO is a member-based organisation with fishers from the islands of Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Cork.  Run by and for fishers, it is a member of the Irish Islands Federation and affiliated to the Low Impact Fishers of Europe, LIFE, which represents around 10,000 small-scale fishers across Europe.<\/p><p>Islanders have worked at national and EU level since 2006 to regain traditional seasonal fishing opportunities around our islands.<br\/><br\/>IIMRO would like to direct the committee to our recent submission on the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill for more detailed background and reasoning behind the Bill, and we would also like to emphasise aspects of the Bill here today.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is a direct response by lawmakers to a recommendation from the cross-party report on promoting sustainable rural coastal and island communities published in 2014.  IIMRO would like to publicly acknowledge and commend the work of the previous joint committee and this committee in working to make the Bill a reality.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of the Bill is to reallocate a small portion of publicly owned quota to boats on the island polyvalent register to allow island communities to co-manage their fisheries and resume a low impact seasonal fishery from small boats.  By allocating public quota in this way, different fish species can be caught at different times of the year as they move closer to the islands and as weather allows.  Boats are under 12 m and use low impact, non-towed gear keeping to the principle of &quot;the right gear in the right place at the right time&quot;.<br\/><br\/>IIMRO is working with a number of partners such as Trinity College Dublin's centre for environmental humanities to co-design and test new approaches that address the needs of fisheries dependent island communities and meet national and European marine objectives.  It is expected that this work will complement the upcoming legislation around the EU marine strategy framework directive and the national marine spatial plan.<br\/><br\/>The Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill offers a chance to change a fisheries policy system that has allowed the nation's publicly owned fishery resource to be concentrated in the hands of a few, at the expense of island and other communities, whose populations continue to decline.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund operational programme summary states that the Irish fishing fleet is characterised by a high share of small-scale vessels and notes that 64% of the total number of vessels are less than 12 m in length, but that these vessels account for only 2% of the total value landed in 2013.<br\/><br\/><i><\/i>Currently, small-scale vessels on the islands are impeded from accessing the publicly owned quota resource by fleet segmentation and layers of rules that include the requirement to have &quot;track record&quot; in a specific fishery before they can access quota for that species.  If a fishing boat did not have catch recorded in certain index years for a quota species, it does not receive quota thereafter, despite the fact that boats under 10 m in length are not required to log their catches.  Typically, these are the most valuable species and would give island fishers a more diverse and sustainable income source instead of the non-quota crab and lobster that make up the bulk of catches at present.  A list of quota species relevant to the islands makes up part of IIMRO's submission, and the committee will note that it does not include salmon, which is not a quota species under the Common Fisheries Policy.<br\/><br\/>IIMRO has worked hard with public representatives across Europe and here at home over a long period to ensure the provisions of the Bill comply with the letter and spirit of the Common Fisheries Policy and other relevant legislation.  The EU Director General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Mr. Machado, confirmed at a meeting with IIMRO members in 2015 that quota assignment was a matter for the national authority and any allocation for islands within the national quota was not contrary to the Common Fisheries Policy.<i><\/i>The Common Fisheries Policy regulation recognises that islands need to be &quot;especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper.&quot;  Our neighbours across the water in Scotland passed historic legislation, the Islands (Scotland) Bill, at the end of May and islanders here are encouraged by the cross-party support which our Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill is receiving.<br\/><br\/>IIMRO is committed to continue working with the Government, other political parties and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make sure the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill is the best possible legislation for our island communities.  We ask committee members to keep the momentum going so that the Bill can become law.

I am a marine social scientist from the centre for environmental humanities, Trinity College Dublin.  For the past 12 years, my research field has been marine environmental governance.  My approach is to identify, support and encourage marine stewardship and co-management within local communities as a means of ensuring effective governance of the marine environment.  I support consideration of the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill as I believe it has the potential to contribute to meeting our national, European and international conservation objectives for the marine environment, while at the same time providing much needed support for our island based inshore fishing communities for whom fishing is important not just economically and socially, but also culturally.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight a number of points.  First, the Bill responds to and aligns with calls from a variety of committees and policymakers at national, European and international levels to support resource dependent island communities.  These include the Oireachtas Joint Sub-Committee on Fisheries in 2014, to which reference has already been made, specifically recommendation 10 of the sub-committee's report.  At a European level, we have the Common Fisheries Policy and internationally we have the voluntary guidelines for securing sustainable small-scale fisheries issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO. <\/p> <p>  Second, the European Commission has expressly called for Europe's small-scale fishers to take the initiative.  Only last month, on 15 May, I attended a fisheries committee meeting in the European Parliament.  At that meeting, Commissioner Vella expressly stated that supporting and helping small-scale fishers is a priority for the Commission.  He observed that member state quotas tend to end up in the \"same hands\" each year at national level and not in the hands of small-scale fishers.  He emphasised that the Commission has no influence over how member states distribute their quota at national level and stressed that small-scale fishers needed to help themselves.  As an example of an initiative whereby Ireland's island based fishers are proactively doing just that, the Bill should be supported.<\/p> <p>  Third, the Bill is an important step towards better marine governance.  It has the potential to complement conservation measures that are currently in place to protect the long-term sustainability of stocks for the inshore sector, such as V-notching of lobsters and minimum landing sizes for crab, as the introduction of island community quota access proposed by the Bill would enable island fishers to return to a low-impact practice of fishing quota species seasonally, rather than fishing non-quota species all year around.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, and finally, the cultural importance of a vibrant fishing industry to our island based communities needs to be recognised and supported.  The Bill recognises and supports islanders' strong sense of belonging to the sea.  I would like to share some research on what I mean when I talk about belonging to the sea.  In 2011 and 2012, together with colleagues, I carried out research on the shared maritime traditions and beliefs in two island communities with a strong fishing heritage - one was the island of Barra in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland and the other was the Donegal island of Arranmore.  Our research suggested that at the heart of these beliefs and traditions was a feeling that is universally potential in human beings, namely, the sense of belonging to a home place and, importantly, a sense of responsibility for that place.  The great Scottish Gaelic scholar, John MacInnes, has described this feeling of belonging as a form of emotional energy, encapsulated by the not easily translatable word \"d&uacute;chas\" in Irish, also \"d&ugrave;thchas\" in Scottish Gaelic.  Our research described this sense of belonging to the sea, or \"d&uacute;chas na mara\", that we found in these island communities and which is evident from their living knowledge of the sea, its place in their stories, histories and legends, how they have made a living from the sea, how it has helped to shape their conduct and beliefs and from the changes that technologies have brought to their relationships with it.  Our research made visible an older and deeper way of knowing the sea which is distinct from but complementary to a way of knowing that is largely informed by book learning and formal education processes.<\/p> <p>  Further research that I carried out on the Scottish island of Barra demonstrated that this intangible cultural heritage and local ways of knowing and doing are key to informing co-management approaches with policymakers that meet national and European conservation objectives.  During the many years of this research, I spent considerable time and energy encouraging community members on Barra to engage constructively with the policy environment rather than pushing it away and, likewise, encouraging Scottish policymakers to recognise the policy value of the island's intangible cultural heritage and local ways of knowing and doing.  It is a breath of fresh air to see Irish island based fishing communities being so proactive and constructive in their engagement with the policy environment here, most recently through the proposal of this Bill.  I thank the committee and urge members to grasp this opportunity and not to squander it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruth Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#T00100","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I want to get to the heart of a few issues.  On one, I will pose a question to all of the witnesses.  How have the fishing restrictions affected the island communities?  Other witnesses have told us that fishing opportunities exist but are not being taken up.  If so, the report of the previous committee would not have suggested the need for an island heritage Bill and we would not be here today.  I would like to flesh this matter out.  What has been the impact of the quota system on people who live on the islands as opposed to those who represent the producer organisations?  Has that been negative or positive?  Are opportunities being missed?  As has been suggested, is this about the need for investment, better marketing and better landing facilities?  Alternatively, is it simply that the opportunity to fish does not exist because, for example, the fish in respect of which there is a quota do not swim around the islands?<\/p> <p>  IIMRO has pushed this matter considerably and I applaud its work in that regard.  We would not be debating this Bill if not for the pressure from IIMRO.  What is its response to the committee's discussion that it heard earlier?  When everything is weighed up, the producer organisations claim that this is not about quota, as quota is available, but about people on the islands needing better infrastructure and not taking advantage of what is available to them, and that this will only add another layer of bureaucracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#T00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their clear presentations and for giving of their time.

For example, how could there be a track record when fishermen did not have to log catches and so forth?  This has inhibited any type of fairness in the sector's quotas.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Murray stated: \"To survive, fishing on the islands needs to revert back to a system of seasonal fishing and local management\".  One of the most damaging changes made to seasonal fishing was the termination of salmon fishing.  All the pressure then fell on non-quota species like lobster, crayfish, crab, etc.  Down my way, people are fishing lobsters for 11 or, sometimes, 12 months of the year.  That is doing long-term damage, but they have to fish to make a living.  If there was an alternative quota species, that pressure could be relieved and the quota distributed more equitably.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Brennan referred to a \"sense of belonging to the sea\".  There are three people present like that.  I live on a peninsula and those are the truest words Dr. Brennan has ever said.  We grew up and worked on the sea, and it became us.  When the livelihoods of inshore fishermen and, in particular, islanders are taken away, a part of themselves is taken away.  This issue needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p>  The island communities played a large role in developing this Bill.

I will provide a response to the first question about fishing the non-quota species all year around but I also invite responses from my colleagues.  My understanding is that the traditional practice is to fish non-quota species seasonally when one can fish other fish stocks.  From the point of view of sustainability, logic dictates that seasonal fishing does impose less pressure on stocks, so if one is fishing species that are traditionally fished seasonally and one fishes them non-seasonally, which is all year around, there is going to be more pressure on the stocks, which could lead to overfishing.  I cannot give figures on that but that is the case in terms of seasonal and non-seasonal fishing.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kenny also asked me about more detail on the engagement between local communities and policymakers in Barra.  First, it was a different context in Barra so, yes, there was a very concrete outcome to that.  The context I was working on in Barra was a conflict over the creation of a marine protected area under the habitats directive.  Many people within the local community were really pushing the policy environment away because they did not want this additional layer of bureaucracy on their already well cared for marine environment.  Six years of research was involved, so to cut a long story short, a very unusual co-management process developed from the dialogue between Marine Scotland and key people on the island, which gave local islanders the opportunity to lead the management of the marine resources in terms of that marine protected area.  They were funded by Marine Scotland to advise it on the best way to manage that marine protected area, which had been designated on the basis of a scientific case.  They looked at how best to manage the marine protected area through the eyes of local people so that the ways they had of managing the marine environment that were not necessarily visible within the policy environment could be brought in and made visible within the policy environment.  It was a way of bringing the policy environment and local people's ways of knowing and doing together.  Marine Scotland proposed that it would be at the table as a co-management partner, if invited, and that its role would be on tap rather than on top.  It really valued the local community's knowledge and ways of doing things.  In the meantime, Brexit has intervened so it is a very different story now.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kenny's third question was whether Commissioner Vella had made further suggestions on how island communities could help themselves.  He did not.  He was talking more generally and he was responding to suggestions that the European Commission should be doing something in order to get more quota into the hands of small-scale fishers.  He was making the point that it is within the competence of the member states rather than the European Commission to decide who the quota is allocated to, and in that vein, small-scale fishers should be taking the initiative to help themselves as well.<\/p> <p>  I wish to respond to one other point, which was from Deputy McConalogue, on the opposition to the Bill on the grounds of it being unfair to inshore fishers that are based on the mainland.  I noticed from all the presentations in the first session that there was much bandying around of the terms \"equality\", \"equity\" and \"discrimination\".  We need to be very precise about the terms that we are using.  First, we need to go back to paragraph 20 of the Common Fisheries Policy and think about why it is there.  It specifically recognises island communities, their different circumstances and their need to be especially recognised and supported.  The reason that is there is because they are in a different position and they do need special support.  We also need to think about the difference between equal treatment and equitable treatment.  Equal treatment means that we treat different people equally.  We give them the same thing.  Equitable treatment means that we provide a level playing field, which I believe is what this Bill is trying to do.<\/p> <p>  It would be easier to explain this using a visual.  I saw a very good visual a few weeks ago explaining the difference between equal and equitable.  Two people were trying to see a football match over a wall that blocked their view.  Those two people were of different heights.  One was tall and one was short but neither could see over the wall.  They were given equal treatment and they were given two stools to stand on that were exactly the same height so they were raised up by the same amount.  One person could now see over the wall but the other person could not.  That is equal treatment.  Equitable treatment means that the person who is shorter is given a slightly taller stool, and now they are both able to see over the wall.  That is why it is so important to use those terms precisely.  What the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill is trying to do is to establish an equitable playing field, and that is why it is speaking directly to paragraph 20 of the Common Fisheries Policy, which recognises the special support that is needed for island communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ruth Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan.

She said there is no next year because there is no child of first communion age.  The impact on that side of it is one thing but when one takes into account the impact on morale that follows on from that, it is a massive issue emotionally for me personally because I have been doing this since 2006.<\/p> <p>  I have been talking in this forum and we have been fighting this campaign.  It is bigger than the Bill.  The Bill is a chance to bring back a little part of what we had.  One could ask whether we will ever get back to the levels of the past.  Absolutely not, but it is a start.  We must stop the trend of where we are going.  That is why the Bill is not just important, it is about the life of the islands.  I implore the committee members to do something.  It is in their hands whether the islands live or die.  I will fight the fight until I can no longer breathe but it is such a massive issue for us.  We have lost a generation of young fishermen.  My grandfather, my father and I were given a simple way of life.  We learned how to row a boat, fish, crew the lifeboat and be an islander.  I have a son who is 19 years of age and he cannot row a boat.  He cannot tie the rope of a boat.  That is not his fault.  It is not my fault.  It is not my grandfather's fault or my father's fault, that is the fault, unfortunately, of the legislators, the Government and the previous Governments of this country.<\/p><p>We were accused of being discriminatory.  That was a new one on me.  That blew me out of my seat: that island people would be discriminating against mainlanders.  I am sorry but that was a ridiculous and irresponsible thing to say.

I know the will is here in the committee and it is imperative that this Bill, even though it is flawed in many ways, gives us a chance to start building again in some shape or form.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#U00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Early","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>My name is Enda Conneely.  I am based on Inis Oirr in the Aran Islands.  I will address some of the points that came up and on which I made notes.<\/p> <p>  I started fishing in a currach in the 1970s.  There were approximately 30 people fishing on the island then.  A community lived off that.  At that time, we could catch cod, haddock, ling, sole -, all the flatfish.  You name it, it was there.  That is not the case any more.  We certainly did not kill them all because we did not have the capacity to do that.  Something has happened.  The point came up earlier that the landings have gone down consistently since the CFP came in and competency passed to the Commission.  I have fished in the United States too where there is a different regime in place.  The area I fished in was very well regulated and people with very big sticks came along to tell us we could not do and what we should not do, and, generally. we did not do it.<\/p> <p>  The quota is available but islanders do not take advantage of them, specifically that relating to mackerel.  Theoretically, 450 tonnes of line-caught mackerel were available to the inshore sector.  If we looked into the white fish quota and how much of that has been taken up by the bigger fleet we would see issues there too.<\/p> <p>  Some of the people who fish on the islands are not fully aware of the existence of this quota and we are restricted by weather and the market.  Once we have access to a quota, this cannot be redressed overnight.  This Bill is a step.  There may be flaws in it that have been pointed out, for example, how quota is a public facility to be distributed by the Minister, for the maximum good of most people.  To judge from what our colleagues who spoke earlier said, that does not seem to be the case.  The quota seems to find its way to the bigger operators.  We are stuck in this area on islands with this idea of scale, which is another problem.<\/p> <p>  The question of the islanders who had the first refrigerated seawater, RSW, boat and got the biggest boat on the fleet came up earlier too.  One factor they all had in common was that when the 50 footers came in during the 1950s and 1960s, they had to leave the islands.  If people got big boats, they had to leave the island.  People chose not to go in that direction and fished the smaller boats.  That is generally the form.  If people scale up, they leave.  We do not want to do that.  We are trying to keep an island community.  The fishing opportunities are allocated by the Minister.  They are not ours but are granted to us.  We have structures in place to deal with this because ours is a member-based organisation.  We have input into the advisory councils that are part of the CFP system because we are on the transparency register.  If we do get access to this we are in the process of setting up a producer organisation for our system.  This is a question of scale and we are small.  If people scale up, they leave the island.  We do not want to do that.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question about unfairness to our neighbours, I am from Inis Oirr, which is very close to Inis Me&aacute;in and Inis M&oacute;r and to the people in Doolin in County Clare.  We have worked with them and find that the inshore sector in Doolin is also restricted to non-quota species.  That is the way it seems to have developed.  This would go a step towards reversing that.  The suggestion of an equitable system sounds very good.<\/p> <p>  In our interaction with it, the Commission pointed out that the allocation of quota was an issue for the member state.  In Ireland, it is up to the Minister.  He could decide this year to allocate X amount of quota to the island fishing boats.  The boats we are talking about are generally small, under 12 m, many are 5 m, 6 m or 7 m.  They would be in the polyvalent general register in any event.  They are on the islands.  This would facilitate their getting involved a managed fishery and area because if everyone is stuck with crab and lobster it will not support everybody.  There are no restrictions coming in on non-quota species.<\/p> <p>  We are also looking at the marine strategy framework directive which is coming down the line, and at spatial planning.  We would be very interested in co-management.  On Inis Oirr we work with Queen's University Belfast and the Marine Institute.  We have worked with the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT.  We are doing a v-notching scheme for lobster that traces the genetics of the lobster.  We are into the seventh or eighth year of that scheme.  It is important for managing the lobster fishery but we need to have some kind of management structure in place for that.  The islands and the people living there have to have an input into that.  One of the points made earlier was that some members of the big organisations were from islands but while they are still connected to their roots on the islands they are not living on the islands because once they scale up they have to leave.  Inis M&oacute;r was slightly different in that it had better harbour facilities.<\/p> <p>  Concern was expressed that this would prevent the development of the industry on islands in some way but this Bill has created so many red herrings from everybody that we will need a special quota allowance if many more of them come into the Chamber.  This is an allocation of fishing opportunity.  If people scale up, they leave the island.  We are not interested in scaling up.  We are interested in managing the fishery around the island so that the fish and spawning areas, all those things, will be there.  We would work with anybody to make that happen.  We are also considering something that came up about the 6-mile limit.  We work within the 6-mile limit because that is a competency of Ireland under the current CFP, which we have to work with unless this new scheme about the baseline is investigated further.<\/p><p>However, that essentially has nothing to do with us.  It has to do with where we are at the moment.  We are within the six-mile limit, which is an Irish competence, which means that the Minister or this committee can decide.  This piece of work has been approved.  It has gone through all the relevant legal people and Departments.  Everyone singed off on this before it came in.  When we saw that, we teamed up with our neighbour islands in Donegal and Kerry.  We felt that this was great and that we could now start promoting this for our islands, and we continued with that. <\/p><p> Somebody may remind me whether I have forgotten something. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Conneely","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>We can come back again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#W00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528813800,"counter":124,"content":"<p>The role of Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann is that of a representative organisation.  To touch on what Mr. Early said previously, we are responsible for many issues related to island life, as members can imagine.  However, they are all pointless if we do not have a population.  I note that 100 years ago there were about 15,000 people living on the Irish islands, across about 60 islands.  There are now fewer than 3,000 people living on fewer than 20 islands.  The rug has been lifted on Irish society a lot over the past 20 years, especially in the past couple of weeks, but over the past hundred years there has been a consistent failure on the protection of islanders.  We are talking about species, but the people the committee members are looking at could be a very rare species if something does not happen in the not too distant future.  This is part of all of the work we are about - that is, to try to convince this committee and others, respective Governments and elected representatives that this country has islands.  It is an island nation.  One would think it would be one of the few places in the European Union that would actually be happy to have offshore islands.  However, we have found living on islands to be a struggle.  That is the long and the short of it.  It is a constant struggle.  Remember what islands are off Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Cork.  They are serious economic drivers in each of those counties and for Revenue in general, especially through tourism.<\/p> <p>  If this Bill, which I hope becomes law in the not too distant future, anchors just a handful of communities across the islands, it will make a huge difference, as Mr. Early said  about the declining numbers.  We are trying to hold onto what we have and not allow it to get worse.  We are interested in anything that we can achieve through this committee or through this Department.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine did something which was very effective across the islands, namely it increased  the areas of natural constraint, ANC, payment and this was of major benefit to island farmers.<\/p> <p>  We are here to continue to save our islands, and the Island Fisheries (Heritage Licence) Bill 2017 is a huge spoke in that wheel.  That is the overarching concept of everything we are about.  Mr. Early and Mr. Conneely can handle all the technical details if members have any more questions on them.  The bottom line is that either we want our islands and want to cherish them or we want them to continue to disappear.  That is what has been happening over the past 100 years.  At this stage we need a huge effort.  We need recognition and a change in the psyche of Government Buildings about the place of islands in our heritage, in our culture and in this country's history. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for answering the questions.  Even now I am learning about this.  One of the things I am still confused about, and about which I asked Mr. Patrick Murphy, is the trading of quota.  There was talk of trade.  Before Mr. Murphy left, I spoke to him again about it.  He said that if a producers' organisation, PO, has a share of quota that its fishers are not able to use, the PO somehow trades it with another PO.  We talked about the 1% of the quota which would be needed by the islanders - 1% of mackerel, of herring or of something else.  On a particular island, it may not be used or needed.  Can that be traded off?  Does that happen?  Is there some kind of quota trading going on?<\/p> <p>  I think the EU has 17 sustainable development goals.  Sustainable development goal 14 is about protecting our waters as a natural environment.  While this Bill provides an opportunity for fishermen to make a living, it has another aspect.  It is also about protecting that environment.  The custodians of that environment will be the fishermen, both the small-scale fishermen who live on the shoreline and those that live on the islands.  I fully take on board the producer organisations' argument that the small-scale fishers that live on the mainland face similar issues.  If we can do this, if we can produce this piece of legislation to work for the islanders, some version of this may work for those other producers later on.  First, we have to try to do something for the most clean-cut sector that we can find, as a model.  The most clean-cut sector we can find is the fishermen that live on the islands.<\/p> <p>  When we get through this, we will have to look at tabling a number of amendments to clarify issues in the Bill.  We will have to clarify that the heritage licence is about getting a portion of quota, and that the only people who will be entitled to get a portion of quota are people who already have a fishing licence for a fishing vessel.  We also need to make provisions for the rules on how to qualify for a heritage fishing licence and how to maintain it.  Sanctions may need to be put in place.  My understanding is that the producer organisations have some of the capacity to implement or set some of those rules at present.  Mr. Murray and mentioned that the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, IIMRO, is trying to develop into a producer organisation in its own right.  Is it the intention of IIMRO to be the agency that would distribute and manage this quota and ensure that it is done in the best interests of the island fishermen?  Is that the IIMRO's intention if we get this Bill through, or would Mr. Murray see that as something that will be done by others?  That is a simple question.  I always feel that where possible we should try to put the power to help people in the hands of those in need of the help, rather than somewhere else.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views in respect of that.  <\/p> <p>  The big stumbling block here seems to be that some sectors feel that by doing this we set a bad precedent, that we are in some way moving a piece of quota into private hands.  Mr. Murray said that there are fewer than 3,000 people living on the islands at the moment.  Is it felt that the island community somehow does not deserve some special consideration to reflect the way the environment around it puts it in the position it is in? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#W00400","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>The general public is not aware of the huge decline of the population on our islands, the hardships associated with trying to scrape out a living there and the very fact that they are probably the most discriminated against sector in our society.<\/p><p>That will go some way to focusing attention on the future of our islands.  It is not going to turn things back to how they were but it will certainly focus attention on it.

I cannot understand it when I hear other organisations going on about problems with distributors and all these obstacles that are being put up.  Some of them probably lived on the islands themselves.  I cannot understand how they could have any objection to doing something right for our island communities.

The Green Party supported the Bill on Second Stage and will support trying to get it through the D&aacute;il in the remaining time of this Parliament.<\/p> <p>    I heard the contributions of Mr. Conneely and Mr. Early as well as that of Mr. Murray whom I know from Inishbofin, which I know very well.  Mr. Conneely stated that his organisation is looking to set up a producer group.  The key issue is route to market.  I know from experience how the fisheries are dominated by non-quota species such as crab or lobster.  If we are moving back to quota species for the likes of the island fisheries, have the witnesses looked at the business model?  It is not going to be the big-scale model they are doing in Killybegs.  There are some examples in Cornwall and other places of other small-scale fisheries for quota species that have a clear route to market and a good price.  For the likes of Inis Oirr, it is important that we get it right and doing so will also help Doolin, which in a sense is peripheral, too.  Similarly, if we got it right in Inishbofin I cannot see how it would not help Cleggan as well.  They have a similar difficulty in terms of lack of distance.  They do not have the resources of the likes of Castletownbere or Killybegs.  If there is a business model that works for Inishbofin I do not see why it should not help Cleggan too.  <\/p> <p>  I missed Dr. Ruth Brennan&rsquo;s presentation earlier but will watch it back on the recording.  When it comes down to dealing with quota species, there are some pelagic shoals coming in and out but in the waters around Inishbofin they are also starting to see pockets of local cod species that could be the sources of a sustainable fishery.  Does Dr. Brennan have any model for a local fishery on an island in that regard?  How do we stop it wiping out a local cod stock or whatever on the first day?  Is there a good example of husbandry of such stocks?  There was for hundreds of years, probably, on Inis Oirr when they were fishing but the tackle and the equipment was different then.  There is such power on boats nowadays that some small boats I have seen coming out of small harbours, even of less than 12 m, could still wipe out a stock that in the past might have supported 30 fishermen on Inis Oirr.  It could probably be done now with the fishing effort of one or two vessels.  How do we develop a sustainable model for some of those quota catches so that they can support probably not 30 but ten or six fishermen?  That would have tremendous effect.<\/p> <p>  What Mr. Murray says is so true.  The knock-on effects in terms of the tourism benefit for the whole county or area are massive.  Even having an indigenous industry changes the nature of tourism.  The area is not just a tourist destination but a place that is carrying on a tradition and developing a new sustainable tradition.  It becomes an interesting place to go to in its own right as well as being special for a range of other reasons.<\/p> <p>  I apologise for jumping in on the discussion having been out.  I have a particular personal interest.  I agree with Deputy Ferris that this is important for everyone.  I am a Dublin Bay South Deputy but if one scratches a Dub one will find someone who is interested in the west coast of Ireland and the islands in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#X00200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I apologise that I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber for part of the meeting.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh muintir na n-oile&aacute;in.  I reiterate what I said earlier.  They are sitting on an island with very limited resources.  They have land and tourism and the sea.  I accept what Deputy Ryan has said about controlled fishing.  It has to be controlled.  The boat might be small but it could still have a powerful ability to hoover up fish.  There is a huge industry to be built out of this.  With food, we are seeing more and more that people want to know where it comes from and that it is genuinely local.  A lot of restaurants claim that all the food is local but sometimes I wonder.  In this case, we can really connect it, certify it and get the extra cost.<\/p> <p>  I have been reading Dr. Brennan's statement.  She hits the nail on the head about something that is often forgotten about human beings.  There are things in people's heritage; some people love fishing, some love horse racing etc.  In rural communities there are people who are attracted to farming, cattle or whatever was in the family even though they have other, better ways of earning a living in the objective sense of money.  Not everything in life is money.  One thing that is inbuilt in many islanders - not all - is a love of fishing and the sea and a very deep knowledge that cannot be acquired from a book.  As Dr. Brennan said, they have d&uacute;chas.  It is important to recognise that yearning in people to access what was accessed by those before them in a sustainable way.  We have to factor that into our thinking.  Not everything in life is pure economics.<\/p> <p>  When I went to the west of Ireland back in 1974, I was meant to be a farmers' co-op manager.  I quickly came to the realisation that the kind of land we had in the west of Ireland would not sustain vibrant, young communities purely on the land.  We developed a different model whereby every household had various sources of income.  That also meant they were less vulnerable to changes, short-term unemployment and so on, because there was something to fall back on.  Someone might have a day job, a farm and some tourist income.  Combined together, the three made a very sustainable family income, if I may use that old-fashioned term, although none would have given the equivalent of a modern income on its own.<\/p><p>We often overlook the importance of small-scale fishing, even though 80% of our fishermen are in that category and of small-scale farming.  Both provide supplemental income which makes the difference between being on the bread line and having a reasonable standard of living.  Obviously, building a house on one's own land is cheaper than having to buy a house on the open market.  In that context, viable communities can be created but that will not be possible if we try to limit each household to one source of income.  These areas are particularly open to the possibility of three or four sources of income per household, thus creating a sustainable family unit.  If we do not give them access to the sea, however, that is not possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018061200002#X00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528813800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.

That is not in the frame at all and I do not know from where it came.  Perhaps it arose as a result of the name of the Bill or the licence.  The quota is allocated by the Minister to the fishing fleet.  The quota that would be allocated to us would be to the polyvalent fleet on the islands that already exists.  We have co-operative structures in place at the moment through which we would be able to manage that but we hope to have a producer organisation set up fairly soon to deal with that as well as with issues like markets and so forth.<\/p> <p>  The second issue is scale.  Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned the route to market.  The business model that bigger operators like Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, KFO, would be using would be a scale model.  We are looking at a smaller scale scenario involving short routes to market.  We are aware of people in Galicia, for instance, who have worked with fishers to put together marketing systems at a local level.  We are also familiar with people in Cornwall who are doing the same.  There are applications available now which enable fishers to sell the fish they catch.  They stop fishing when they cannot sell their catch.  They leave fish in the sea and only take what they need.  These things are possible with technology.  That is what we are working towards.  If Inis O&iacute;rr pulls ahead with this and puts a good system in place, that can be replicated in Doolin and elsewhere.  An island is a very contained unit and so provides an ideal environment for testing this model.  We are looking at a scale that is small and manageable.  If we make any mistakes or errors or if we figure out a better way of doing things, we will do so at a manageable scale.  <\/p> <p>  It has taken us 30 years to get here, in the sense of going down.  We are not going to get back up by magically being given access to fish.  That said, we need access to start building up gradually.  We need to build a marketing system.  Everything that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said about how island, coastal and rural communities work is true in that everything is interlinked.  Tourism needs fishing to happen, otherwise we will be importing Pangasius from somewhere else and serving it on Inishbofin or the Aran islands.  That is not what we want to do.  Everything is interlinked, including the small bits of farming, fishing and tourism.  Scale is an issue.  There seems to be a mad rush within the system to scale up everything.  On the world stage, Ireland is not a scale economy as such.  As a country we should be looking at where we get value as opposed to rushing to the simple marketing notion of scaling everything up, making products in China and selling them to somebody else.  <\/p> <p>  We are dealing with a resource here that is diminishing.  It is a finite resource.  Technology is such now, especially at the industrial level, that we can actually kill every fish in the sea.  In that context, we must scale back.  All of the inshore area is mainly spawning ground.  I am aware of one fishery in the late 1980s and early 1990s that got a market for herring roe.  It targeted the spawning herring to such an extent that the species has still not recovered.  We cannot do that kind of thing anymore.  The scale at which we are working is not market led.  If one gets into big boats, one gets into all sorts of problems.  One has to kill more fish but there are no more fish so one has to manage it.  That is where we have gone but we want to crawl our way slowly back.  We can do that with this Bill.  There will be amendments, I assume, in terms of legalities and things that can be done.  The witnesses that were here today were all in favour, in principle, of doing something for the islands.  However, their interpretation seemed to be that this would involve privatising quota but that is impossible.  The Minister allocates quota to certain groups, as he or she does with everything else.  We on the islands recognise paragraph 20 and Article 17.  <\/p> <p>  I am conscious that we have been here all day and that the committee has given us an awful lot of time.

He asked if quota species are to be fished under the Bill, how we would stop a local cod fishery being wiped out and whether there are models that could do this.  He also raised the point that modern fishing gear, even on small boats, has a much greater capacity to catch fish.  Just because fishing gear is modern does not preclude it from being used to achieve more sustainability.  Fishing gear adaptations such as escape hatches and creels are good examples of this.  The Deputy's questions should force us to reflect on what assumptions we make that underlie how we frame fishers.  He asked whether specific models are in existence that could address this.  I can look into the literature and find umpteen models that would address it, but my approach is always to work with local communities and to listen to them and ask them what their approaches are because they are the people who have this knowledge.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the point on framing and the question on how we stop it wiping out a local cod fishery, we are automatically framing fishers with only one identity, which is as individual competing fishers who are damaging a resource.  The approach I come from is to recognise that all of us have varying identities, and the important identity I work with always is to support an ethos of marine stewardship, and working with fishers, in particular, as marine stewards.  If we come from this platform of viewing fishers as stewards of the marine resource, which islanders want to do because they want to keep the resource, and work with them to use their local knowledge to develop models that make sense from a local point of view and that are informed by their knowledge, which has been garnered over generations, then we can come up with viable models that will guard against the Deputy's concerns.<\/p> <p>  I was recently awarded funding by the European Commission to do the work I am describing with IIMRO.  It has funded me to work with IIMRO for two years to develop innovative governance initiatives that meet conservation objectives at national and European levels.

The theme of broadband installation affects consumers in their homes but also the key area of all our businesses.  ALTO is a trade association which has been operating since 1999, so we are 19 years in the fight to get quality broadband and services to consumers, while making sure that the regulatory and Government environment and the market conditions are in the correct position to facilitate services and ensure proper competition at all levels of the market.  For today's purposes, we produced a long statement which the committee will have seen at this point.  If it is appropriate, the statement can be taken as read.  As the Chairman indicated in terms of time slots, we intend to split the presentation.  Mr. O'Brien will deal with market and strategic issues and Mr. Barrins will deal with the second element, namely, regulation.  The third issue is regulatory governance and the regulatory governance model, which is a voluntary scheme that was undertaken by Eircom and which resulted in significant disclosures of issues in the market.  Mr. O'Dwyer will deal with that.  I will briefly deal with the status of Eircom at this point.  With the Chairman's permission, I will not take my full five minutes now but, at the end of the presentations, I will give conclusions so we have a proper flow to the evidence in the presentation.<br\/><br\/>ALTO has ten members, so it is a significant voice in the Irish market.  Our members are  BT Ireland, Sky Ireland; Colt Telecom, Magnet Networks, Siro, 3 Ireland, ESB Telecoms, Virgin Media, Verizon and Vodafone.  As members can see, that is pretty much everybody in the marketplace apart from Eir and, possibly, Enet.  It is a significant grouping.  We operate strictly under the competition law obligations imposed on us and we are also registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, for lobbying purposes.<br\/><br\/>Moving to the issue of Eir and its status, members will be very aware of the privatisation and public flotation of Eircom in 1998 and the various iterations of ownership which have taken effect.  What we have seen is a situation where we must rely on elements of the Eir network to be healthy and to perform and for it to comply with regulatory governance and regulation in the main.  What we see is that such compliance is not what we would like it to be.  We now have a new ownership structure, but what we say in our statement is <i>plus &ccedil;a change<\/i>.  There is now a French body of investors involved in the company.  We have not really seen anything concrete in terms of proper management and governance.  A message we would like to give to the committee is that, with the new board that has been installed, a number of high-profile and experienced telecoms executives are now in there and we would like to see them put regulatory governance and compliance with the regulation to the forefront of their minds, as the previous board within Eir did, which has only been let go in recent times.  That is where we are in respect of our views with regard to the Eir position.  We do not want to be too critical because what the regulatory governance model, RGM, piece of this presentation does is disclose certain other issues so we will get to that in due course.<br\/><br\/>That is all I will say at the moment until such time as I get to my concluding remarks which, hopefully, will follow nicely.

Wholesale operators in the market are paying a connection charge of &euro;272 for the full Eir fibre to the home, FTTH, product.

We will put a link into the document.  We are the highest for some charges and second highest for others in the European market.  That is not only bad for operators like ourselves trying to compete in the market and relying on the infrastructure of the incumbent but it is also bad for the Irish citizen in terms of having to pay these fees.<\/p> <p>  One only has to look at Eir's financial performance as well to see some of the evidence of that flowing through in the books.  Eir's total profitability or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, EBITDA, at 40% means it is one of the most profitable incumbents in Europe, and it is fixed-line EBITDA, so taking it away from the mobile business it is 45%, which again is very high in terms of its peers in Europe.  It also, coincidentally, has one of the highest reliance on a wholesale market than anybody else, relying upon other operators like ourselves here representing ALTO.  More than 26% of its revenue comes from wholesale operators so one gets a combination of high prices and also, effectively, a large part of that market then underpins its business.  It is also, perhaps not coincidentally, one of the most heavily indebted operators in Europe, with more than &euro;2 billion of debt still on its books.  That is not a great financial vista.<\/p> <p>  It is our view that the current regulatory structure is fundamentally failing the market.  I refer here to the lack of regulation of the incumbent and of Eir.  Two independent reports commissioned by ComReg last year, the so-called Cartesian report and the KPMG report, point to some of this, highlighting significant governance findings hindering Eir's behaviour and how it behaves in the market.<\/p> <p>  ComReg has completed an initial review and it is consulting on that.  Hopefully, more progress is expected during this year.  We feel that the most appropriate model that will deliver proper fundamental and systematic changes is what is known as functional separation, which is effectively a separation of the retail from the wholesale arm of Eir into two distinct entities as the only avenue that will ensure sustainable competition in the market.  When one sees a company which has a wholesale and retail business effectively side by side, one gets the sort of behaviours one sees in the market whereby there is a connection charge to wholesale operators of &euro;272 and effectively a free connection charge to its own retail customers on the other side.  Some of those sort of behaviours are what can occur.  For us, what this means is that it is a fantastic opportunity for ComReg in the coming years to address some of these issues and to take the appropriate action moving in that direction.  We believe that only deeper structural remedies can provide the right competitive environment and give that balance to the regulatory regime that we are looking for.<\/p> <p>  A slightly tangential point is that there was an auction early in 2017 for 3.6 GHz spectrum, the so-called 5G spectrum.  The auction was run by ComReg.  That spectrum is key for the roll-out of 5G in the coming years.  Another operator still remains on that spectrum nearly 18 months later and ComReg is refunding money to operators as a result.  This is money that was paid to ComReg to purchase the spectrum and that is now being effectively drip fed back to some operators because we have not had access to that spectrum.

I would say the level of complexity of the issues they have to deal with has grown exponentially since my time in ComReg.  They are contending with a plethora of different technologies, including fibre to the curb, FTTC, FTTH, and asymmetric digital subscriber line, ADSL.  To the consumer, all of these things look the same as broadband, but they have made ComReg's task much harder.  As far as I understand, ComReg's resources have not increased one iota since the 2000-2003 period.  At that time, we were working off between 125 and 130 staff and I think ComReg has a similar number of staff now.  We have some sympathy for ComReg when it is dealing with delays, market reviews and dispute resolutions because of the resource constraints it faces.  While we all accept that delays happen, the difficulty arises when delays persist for periods of three or four years.  We can all live with delays of two, three or six months.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example.  In 2013, ComReg conducted an interim review of its 2011 market review.  This coincided with the launch of Eircom's primary broadband product, which is an FTTC product.  As part of its main broadband product for the future, Eircom was selling speeds of up to 100 Mbps.  At that time, ComReg determined that there was no need to impose a charge control on FTTC services given that this was a nascent technology.  It believed there were sufficient constraints to protect consumers, including us, and retail customers.  That worked fine in 2013 and 2014, but Eircom was bringing in more and more customers all the time.  Its market power, in an economic sense, was increasing.  It increased prices by 10% in 2015 and by a further 20% in May 2016.  This 30% price increase in the space of 12 months caused alarm bells to ring.  It was clear that the constraints which were placed on Eir, as it had become by that stage, were not sufficient.  Everyone in the industry, including ComReg personnel, knew that something had to be done.  We are now in June 2018 and the market review that was initiated by ComReg has not yet happened.  We are still subject to those prices, which of course are passed onto consumers because it is a wholesale charge.  According to ComReg's preliminary review report, as a consequence of what I have outlined there has been a transfer of wealth from other operators and customers to Eir.<\/p> <p>  It is remarkable to see that Eir has rolled out its entire FTTC network and basically overhauled and upgraded its whole network entirely from cashflow.  It has not had to go back to a single shareholder for a cent of equity.  It has not gone to a bank to raise a cent of debt.  It has all been done through cashflow.  If we took a pragmatic view, we might say \"We may have been overcharged, but at least we got an FTTC network out of it\".  The problem relates to what will happen in the future if these prices are not reduced very soon.  According to the press release released by Iliad after it acquired Eir, \"In the medium term through this investment, Iliad expects to generate a dividend stream and yield a double-digit return on equity.\"  It is clear that Iliad is hoping that the transfer of wealth will continue for some time to come.  At the time of that announcement, Iliad referred publicly to a &euro;1 billion investment plan in Ireland over the next five years.  If one mentions a figure like &euro;1 billion, it looks really good and gets one a great headline.  In fact, when it is matched against what Iliad's revenue stream will look like over the same period, it involves a capital intensity rate of approximately 15%, which is pretty modest and well below what Eir has been doing over the past five years.  Indeed, it is well below what Iliad has been doing in France, where it has had a capital intensity rate of 30%, or twice its figure in Ireland.  I think that is quite significant.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the FTTH connection charges.  The plan seems to be the same again, as it involves &euro;270 for a connection.  I appreciate that it is expensive to connect homes in rural areas.  Telecoms investments are meant to be recovered over cycles of 20, 30 or 40 years.  One does not look to get such investments financed upfront by other operators.  One does not allow operators to start selling one's product and then start charging those operators a good chunk on a monthly rental basis thereafter.  The transfer of wealth point is of concern.  These are not our complaints.  In its preliminary review, ComReg said that these charges should not be charged upfront at this level.  It believes the charges should be considerably lower.  I guess it is a question of why we are seeing these delays.  One of the concerns we have is the litigious history of Eir.  ComReg might say it is not affected by that, but the reality is that the amount of work it has to do to dot the i's and cross the t's means that it needs more resources.  In addition, as Mr. O'Brien has suggested, ComReg needs more powers so it can be confident that the decisions it makes will stick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Barrins"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Mr. O'Dwyer, who is the head of regulation of BT Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#G00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I will speak about the regulatory governance model.  I had to look up the regulatory governance model to be sure what it is.  By 2011, there had been years of difficult times marked by problems with trying to get the original broadband going.  There had been arguments, complaints and disputes against the old Eircom.  There was a change of management in 2011.  The new managers decided it was going to reform Eircom, try to improve its relationship with industry and work better with industry.  They made some commitments to the industry.  I remember a big meeting at the Gibson Hotel.  They made a commitment to the industry that they would work better.  We are now finding in some of the documentation - we did not know this at the time - that Eircom made commitments to ComReg about how its reform would work.  Eircom has documented this.  Basically, it made voluntary commitments to the regulator around non-discrimination and improving its relationship with industry, etc.  Those voluntary commitments comprise what we call the regulatory governance model.  Eircom committed to having a better model to improve the situation, but there was no noticeable change from 2011 until approximately 2015.  We carried on having disputes and complaints, etc.  In August 2015, when we were having some difficult discussions about issues we were having with broadband at the time, Eircom published a document that was distributed by email to everybody in the whole industry.  It was quite stunning to receive this document, which was not necessarily distributed as confidential, from Eircom.  It described the whole regulatory governance model that the company had agreed in 2011.  This was the first time we saw it.  In the paper, which highlighted and documented a number of issues of discrimination or compliance that Eircom was having, the company recognised the issues and set out what it was going to do about them.  We might have disagreed with the detail of some of the solutions, but at least they were there.  The document in question is quite technical.  It is difficult to digest whether the many issues covered in it are actually very serious.

When one gets into the detail of it to try to understand it, one sees that some, but not all, of the issues are very serious and have quite serious implications.  I would like to mention something called address matching as an example.<\/p><p>We did not have postcodes at the time and there is a unique version of everybody's address within Eir's system.  The problem is it may not be necessarily the same address that the current occupant of the house would know.  As the addresses are not necessarily unique, it can be difficult sometimes to work out what the customer thinks the address is as against the system's address.  It is very important to get this right because if a service has to be delivered, it must go to the right address.  A telephone line, for example, must be delivered to the right address.  This was complicated when unique addresses were not available.  Eir had a better set of addresses for its downstream retail arm than was being provided to the rest of industry.<\/p><p> It could take up to a week for some operators selling broadband services, for example, to try to work out the exact address with the customer.  This frustrated customers who wondered why the companies did not have something as simple as an address.  It could take a week to get the address right going back and forth with Eir trying to work it out.  The customer might think the new provider is not doing a very good job and he or she would not move but rather stay with the current provider.  It hindered customer choice in changing a provider.  This is important, certainly to the customer, and causes consumer harm because customers could not exercise choice and had to pay more money than they might have done otherwise.  The new operator would also be hindered from earning money from winning customers.  That was the problem.<\/p><p> A two-pronged approach followed.  The first was to get Cartesian and KPMG to do a governance investigation operation.  This made a number of recommendations, one of which was to have an independent oversight body looking at the governance and operations of Eir, keeping that under control.  Simultaneous to those consultations, ComReg investigated non-compliance and took legal proceedings through the High Court.  It found several cases of non-compliance and has taken Eir to the High Court to have fines imposed for non-compliance.  The case has been held up by a challenge in the High Court which will be heard later this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Dwyer","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":162,"content":"<p>There are a number of issues we would like to summarise in what we think the committee can do to assist the market and bring better services to the communities and constituents that they serve.

There is a second issue that is extremely important for the committee's work.  In 2003, the communications regulator operated with staff levels of approximately 120 people.  At a minimum, 70 staff need to be put into ComReg.  The industry pays for this and the funding would not come from the Exchequer.  ComReg's recent returns reported that &euro;136 million was returned to the Exchequer on a cost outlay of &euro;32 million.  That is the most up-to-date information.  We are calling for more resources, including lawyers, economists, wholesale compliance staff, retail staff if necessary.  This also applies to national broadband plan.  A plethora of people are required to buffer the regulator and do so quickly.<\/p> <p>  The third issue of market reviews will be resolved with resourcing and a surge, if that is appropriate, of people going into ComReg.  The fourth issue is what Mr. O'Dwyer spoke about.  It is a highly complex issue and difficult to address in the time available to Mr. O'Dwyer.  I should be very clear about it.  The regulatory governance model affects the ability of the people before the committee - the new entrant operators - to provide competitively priced high-speed broadband services to all the nation.  We are required to use the services of the incumbent from time to time and if it is not correct or there are non-compliance or discrimination issues built in, they must be dealt with and ComReg must get going on that piece of work faster than it says it will.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned in my opening comments the matter of a new board within Eir.  Very high-profile executives are due to take seats on that board.  Compliance with regulation should be at the forefront of their minds, as should the facilitation by Eir of its wholesale customers - the telecommunications operators we represent - for the benefit of the consumer.  This requires a reduction in prices and facilitation of high-speed services.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the 5G impasse, a straightforward issue that I will not get into.  Another point is worth noting and Deputies Dooley and Ryan will be aware of it.  The issue of passive infrastructure, namely, access to poles and ducts, is controversial as it can upset constituents if roads and so on are being dug up.  Eir has that infrastructure and to some extent the ESB network is available as well.  We need fit for purpose access to passive infrastructure as new entrants and we call on the committee to consider that issue for its report.  There are five or six points that we have noted as being key to resolving many of the bottleneck issues and constraints that stop consumers from obtaining effective services and these have the effect, if not remediated, of keeping prices high in the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>We are all tight on time.

It is good for members to hear that but we will not be able to resolve it other than through empowering the regulator to address it.

I have spent some time trying to work out what would happen if there was a charge per pole to build infrastructure and get past the blue speckles on the map.  Eir has got the 300,000 households that are the easiest to reach.  How will companies go beyond that point?

It is a double remit and we are addressing both.<\/p> <p>  The pricing comparison is interesting and scary.  I assume that the argument that Eir would make, one that was touched on tangentially by Deputy Stanley, is that it must tackle difficult terrain and infrastructure and that it is a unique case.  According to the witnesses, though, it has a high profit level.  They are also claiming that ComReg does not have the necessary power, that is to say, Parliament has not conferred on it those powers apart from providing it with internal resources.

Deputy Niall Collins has a Private Members' Bill which looks in particular at the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and arming it with civil sanction powers.  Many of the regulators, including ComReg, have co-competition responsibility and co-competition powers.  We say that if the Government adopts the Private Members' Bill, it should simply be extended to the other regulators which have asked for civil sanction powers.  They have all made submissions to the Law Reform Commission within which Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Burke is writing a report on this subject, which will probably overlap with the committee's work.  It is probable that Dr. Burke's report will contain recommendations on civil sanction powers.  There are constitutional issues and issues on the powers of the courts and whether a regulator can simply fine someone without the approval of the High Court.  That is the current status but I do not really want to get into it for present purposes.  However, I note that there is a requirement for quick and efficient sanctions.  I do not want to appear like a turkey wishing for Christmas because it affects us too.  We could be fined if we misbehave.  It is something we are looking for structurally across the industry to give ComReg more teeth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>It is currently very harmless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#K00700","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>It is fairly weak in the context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#K00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":182,"content":"<p>It would not affect Mr. Lupton's members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#K00900","speaker":"1397"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Not really.

Moving forward, civil sanctions can provide quick wins.  While I hate using a simple expression like that, the reality is that it is an incentive to behave.  It is not just Eir, but everybody.  It will be across the board.  We have to be careful how we ask for it, in case we get something we do not like, but that is where we are on that.  I highlight that Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' Bill because it is not too far away from what we foresee as a route to facilitating ComReg.<\/p> <p>  I pick up on the issue of the 300,000 premises, which Mr. Liam O'Brien may deal with also.  As a lawyer, which is the other hat I wear aside from being chairperson of ALTO, I note that the State had no choice in respect of facilitating the transfer or deal around the 300,000.  There was no issue in respect of that because it was commercially viable for Eircom to apply to carve out those homes.  That is just the way it is and we can say no more than that as it would be unfair to do so.  That is the position we are in.  I will hand over to Mr. O'Brien to speak from an investment point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#K01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ronan Lupton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>To go back to what Mr. Barrins said at the start, we are speaking here about long-term investments in the market.  Investments in fibre infrastructure for homes are not made for a small number of years, they are made for decades.  What is important in that context is the fact that in making those investments, one looks into a market where one has confidence in the market, in the regulatory regime within the market, in the prices within the market, how the market will operate and evolve.  When there is uncertainty as to how a market will evolve, when there are delays in market governance and reviews and when there is a regulator with limited powers who is unable to enforce compliance on other operators, it creates a drag on investment.  Others would be less likely to invest.  Notwithstanding that, Vodafone has created with the ESB a joint venture partner, which is separately a member of ALTO, called SIRO.  Members might be familiar with it.  As such, we are putting out money where our mouth is and not just standing on the sidelines throwing stones.  SIRO is investing hundreds of millions of euro to bring fibre to homes in other parts of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Senator O'Reilly asked whether others would have done the deal on the 300,000 premises and as Mr. Lupton said, it is slightly more complex than that given the nature of the deal.  However, others are investing.  We are also investing in fibre to the home in the Irish market through our joint venture with SIRO.  Wholesale competition is part of the answer here.  It is a \"Yes\" on regulating incumbents to ensure they operate in a fair and compliant way but there is also an onus on industry and on us to be part of that solution.  We feel the investments we are making are part of the solution.  While we are bringing money to the table, it unlikely that we can replace Eircom and cover the whole market.  We all want a strong but fair Eir in the market.  It needs to be there to give access to constituents and access to ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Senator O'Reilly referred to pricing.  There is a question around whether the delay in wholesale price reductions are a consequence of a lack of powers or resources and the answer is that it is probably a lack of resources.  ComReg has the powers to reduce prices and has outlined what in its preliminary view prices should come down to.  While that could ultimately be appealed, ComReg certainly has the power to implement lower prices.  Connected to that, Deputy Naughton asked whether it was about staff or expertise.  While it is a combination of both, expertise is required in the wholesale area certainly.  It is an extremely complex area from market definition to designation of somebody having dominance in accordance with EU legislation to then going to the job of building cost models.  These things are extremely costly and difficult to build and there are pages and pages of Excel sheets in that regard.  A great deal of expertise and input is required for that.  It is a question of having the right kind of staff also.  I do not know what the wage structure in ComReg is but it might be something that could be looked at if the necessary expertise is required.  The Deputy asked if this would impact on consumers, which is highly unlikely given the figures outlined by Mr. Lupton on the levy.  The current levy is at 0.2% of revenue for each operator.  No one will be passing that on to the consumer.<\/p> <p>  There was a further question on the need for functional separation, which Mr. O'Dwyer will deal with more extensively.  I will deal with it in relation to pricing.  One of the things that emerged from the KPMG and Cartesian reports was that Eir's wholesale and retail pricing division sit together.  They literally sit in the same place in the office.  That is an extraordinary advantage for one's retail arm to have.  It is simply not credible that the retail arm does not know what the wholesale arm is doing.  When one is sitting down strategising about pricing and is in that 300,000 home footprint, one will ask what a good policy would be.  They might charge &euro;270 for connection at the wholesale level and nothing at the retail level.  Anyone will say intuitively that there is something wrong with that, if one is offering it for nothing at the retail level and for &euro;270 at the wholesale level, while taking on some small regional operators.  Some small operators have come on with Eir, which will tell one that it has lots of operators connected, but Eir is still doing 80% or 90% of retail sales there.  That is a problem and it needs to be looked at in respect of functional separation.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate the points made by Mr. Lupton and Mr. O'Brien.  It was a sensible decision by Eir on a commercial basis to cherry pick the 300,000 premises and the Government was stuck between a rock and a hard place because of EU state aid rules and really had no choice in the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Barrins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I will finish up on functional separation.  The concept of functional separation is about creating space between the wholesale division of Eir and its retail division.  Creating that space helps one to understand whether there is any discrimination or poor treatment taking place.  In a functionally separated world, the wholesale division would still be owned by Eircom and ultimately controlled by it from the top.  However, its focus would be set as wholesale and the employees in that wholesale division would be incentivised with a bonus structure or whatever to sell wholesale services.  They would not be incentivised to sell whole-of-group services.  If they are incentivised for the whole group, they get a benefit if retail makes a lot of money as well as wholesale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#K01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. O'Dwyer will explain how the telecommunications operators achieve that in practice?

The companies know which employees work in wholesale or retail.  They can be identified through employee reference details and so on.  The wholesale employees are incentivised and paid bonuses to do a good wholesale job, and that is their function.  There is reporting internally and the company would know its finances and so on.  If wholesale does well, the employees working in the wholesale area would be rewarded, as one would expect.<\/p> <p>  Another way is through system separation, where the wholesale division has its own databases and systems for order handling, etc.  The wholesale division owns the systems and retail has a different set of systems.  If retail wants to buy something from wholesale in those cases then it goes through the same front door as everybody else who uses wholesale.  One creates a system separation level.  It has become much easier to do that these days because with cloud-based systems, new physical systems do not have to be built.  Retail and wholesale versions of software can be run.  Systems can be created to ensure the wholesale division is separate.  In doing it this way, we can see the space that has been created between the wholesale and the retail divisions.  Retail employees should not be on the wholesale systems and they should not have access to the data other than for items they are buying from the wholesale division.  A split is created with space between them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the bonus schemes and incentives, an overlaying governance is needed to make it clear to the wholesale division employees that they are wholesale, that they do not share the confidential information of the other operators with the downstream arm and that they do not talk to the downstream retail arm about what other companies such as Sky, BT or Virgin are doing.  The governance is set up so that employees understand the rules.  There can be disciplinary practices if the rules are broken and so on.  There are ways of doing it.  In the UK it has been done by BT with its Openreach set-up.  It has evolved to another step now but the discrimination issues are well handled with functional separation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Dwyer"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>That is a role for ComReg.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018061200002#L00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>ComReg would need to do it.

I suspect that ComReg would face a number of challenges if it tried to do this because legal proceedings may be brought to try to stop it.

I thank the members who attended and Senator Paul Daly for stepping in.<\/p><p>The purpose of this part of the meeting is to resume the committee's review of relationships and sexuality education, RSE.  This is the third of three sessions.  We are gathering evidence on RSE in Ireland.  We have gathered compelling evidence regarding what is happening and not happening in our education system in this regard, acknowledging that it has been 20 years since a programme was put in place and, with the advent of social media, etc., that many concerns are not being addressed.  There is also a lack of consistency in how RSE is taught in our schools and at third level.  We are also cognisant that the responsibility should not just fall on schools or educational organisations, and there is also a responsibility on parents and communities.  It is a question of how we can all work together and make recommendations in this regard.  We want to improve the curriculum to give our young people the skills they need, particularly in the areas of consent and contraception.<\/p><p>Our witnesses will provide a good variety of opinions, views and experience that will certainly help to influence the report we intend to compile and issue after all these engagements.  I welcome Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar, executive director of Rape Crisis Network Ireland; Mr. Niall Behan, chief executive of the Irish Family Planning Association; Ms Jane Donnelly, human rights officer, Atheist Ireland; Dr. Aoife Neary, lecturer in sociology of education at University of Limerick, UL; Dr. Debbie Ging, associate professor of media studies at Dublin City University, DCU; Dr. Aidan Seery, senior tutor with the school of education at Trinity College Dublin; Ms Sarah Haslam, who is the training, learning and development manager with For&oacute;ige; and Ms Orla McGowan, programme manager for education, HSE.  I acknowledge that Mr. Michael Nugent, Ms Avril Hickey and Ms Helen Deely are in the Public Gallery.<\/p><p>The format of this part of the meeting is that I will invite the witnesses to make brief opening statements, three minutes maximum, which will be followed by an engagement with the members of the committee.  As we have a significant number of witnesses, which is important in their sharing the different views and experience they have, I ask them to respect the three-minute rule in so far as possible.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of the witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  I must direct them also that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise them that the opening statements they make to the committee may be available on the committee's website after this meeting, as will the submissions they kindly forwarded.<\/p><p>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I call Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#E00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  We are delighted to be here.  We have been engaged on this issue for some time and we have been convinced that it needs Government-level engagement and intervention.  Rape Crisis Network Ireland is a specialist information and resource centre on sexual violence.  We are owned and governed by our member rape crisis centres and we develop policies, responses, reactions and strategies in this area.<\/p> <p>  The focus on sexual health education is often drawn to this issue based on public debate arising out of sexual violence crimes and our sense that we could do more to prevent them.  We rightly ask questions about the messages about sex and sexual relationships to which our children are exposed in our culture and the messages they receive from the sources we hope set standards of behaviour that are safe, supportive and empowering, such as from parents, schools and trusted authorities.<\/p><p>The questions include how should we support everyday respectful, safe and healthy sexual behaviour and whether we have fully engaged our institutions and structures to ensure our children and young people share in and contribute to evolving positive values on sexual behaviour and expectations?  Curriculum content is one aspect to address, but it is vital we understand that excellence here will be ineffective in the absence of a holistic response which ensures the institutional context and care responses also support positive sexually healthy relationships.  I really want to focus on matters relating to that area but I am also happy to talk about curriculum content.  <\/p><p> Historically the State has been resistant and ambiguous towards sexual autonomy and liberation.  This has resulted in silences, paralysis and gaps, not least in sexual education in the schools system.  We suggest that the ambiguity with which we have treated sex education has been baked into our institutions and bureaucratic structures and it is our view that those need to be addressed if we are to serve our children adequately in this matter.  Rather than one location that holds the strategic lead on this matter there are currently four Departments and at least six strategies and policies that have a role in shaping sexual health education.  Each of these strategies has a role in ensuring children and young people have access to the education and supports they need to prepare them to make healthy decisions about their sex lives.  It is doubtful to us that there is any one statutory location that has the full picture or oversight in the area of sexual health education, which risks leaving the Department of Education and Skills with a lack of insight into the capacities and resources it has to hand and clarity of objective in curriculum and policy development and implementation.  For example members may find it surprising to hear that the relationship and sexuality education, RSE is under review at the moment.  Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, submitted seven modules to the RSE review in 2015.  However, this is not happening within the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Curriculum and Advancement, NCAA.  Instead, it is happening in the HSE under the crisis pregnancy programme, within the B4UDecide programme.  The HSE, of course, is working in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills.  <\/p><p> We would bring to members' attention another difficulty in the multitude of overseeing bodies.  When looking across the national strategies which the Department of Education and Skills is subject to in various manners it is clear that actions in the area of sexual health education consent, harm and violence prevention use the word \"prevention\" to mean different things.  It has become standardised internationally to differentiate between primary and secondary prevention, not least because the two require very different capacities and activities.  Primary prevention is a whole of population approach that seeks, through generalised intervention, to stop the issue from arising in the first place.  Secondary intervention seeks to respond to harm, to identify it early and respond.  This distinction is not consistently embedded across Government activities in this area.  It is our experience that these failures to distinguish uniformly across Government creates gaps and inefficiencies at best and actions that nullify the effectiveness of each other at worst.  An example is the Department of Education and Skills's action plan on bullying, which establishes whole-of-school guidance on bullying prevention, that is, primary prevention.  It is an excellent resource but it seems to have abandoned addressing sexual harassment, although it continued to address cybersexual harassment, on the basis that sexual crime is dealt with by Children First.  However, Children First is almost entirely about secondary prevention activities, not about primary prevention.  This leaves schools with no national primary prevention action plan outside of curriculum content regarding sexual harassment, notwithstanding some excellent generalised whole-of-school school ethos and values programmes.  Instead, we find ourselves waiting for children to be at risk of harm before we intervene under Children First.  <\/p><p> Clarity and agreement at all policy levels as to what level of prevention they are engaging in is essential.  We are asking for a joined-up approach.  We need a national strategy.  Failing that, consideration should be given to a sort of national review of the policy landscape in this area.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I ask that everyone present ensures that his or her phone is turned to flight mode or turned off, because they interfere with the recording and cause difficulty for the parliamentary reporters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#F00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it this afternoon.  The Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, welcomes the review of relationship and sexuality education undertaken by the joint committee.  The IFPA is probably best known for its medical clinics and counselling centres but over many years we have been delivering sexuality education to young people, parents, teachers, youth workers and carers, among other groups.  We currently provide a range of programmes, mainly to parenting groups through our Speakeasy programme, which is funded by the crisis pregnancy programme of the HSE.  The other programmes we have run have generally been funded through once-off initiatives.  They have been short-term projects with which we have been able to do some innovative things but we have always faced difficulties in our attempts to mainstream those projects.  We have learned a lot from those projects.<\/p> <p>  As a reproductive healthcare provider we see in our clinics and counselling centres the impact of poor quality sexuality education at first hand.  We see it every day.  We see it in our pregnancy counselling centres with unintended pregnancies, in our clinics with sexually transmitted infections, and in our training workshops in the lack of understanding of the issues involved.  The profound gender inequality present in the issues we see really sticks out for us.  Women and girls largely bear the burden of inadequate sexuality education and are exposed to some of the risks I have mentioned already.  For these reasons we are deeply concerned about the public health impact of inadequate, inconsistent and poor quality sexuality education, particularly in schools in Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  As a reproductive healthcare providers we see in our clinics and counselling centres the impact of poor quality sexuality education first hand.

Women and girls largely bear the burden of inadequate sexuality education, and are exposed to some of the risks I have mentioned already.  For these reasons we are deeply concerned about the public health impact of inadequate, inconsistent and poor quality sexuality education, particularly in schools in Ireland. <\/p> <p>  We have identified four areas for the committee that we believe should be focused on.  The first area is the RSE curriculum and the need to broaden it.  There seems to be a consensus that high-quality, comprehensive sexuality education facilitates the development of accurate and age-appropriate knowledge and attitudes and promotes positive values.  It is seen as a good thing.  It respects human rights, gender equality and diversity, and provides an important opportunity to reach young people with accurate information before they become sexually active, as well as offering a structured environment in which to learn.  Real education only really happens if it is genuinely comprehensive, and we have some concerns that the RSE programme is not genuinely comprehensive.  We believe the content of the RSE curriculum must be revised to reflect international best practice, particularly in terms of contraceptive use, sexually transmitted infections, information around abortion, sexuality orientation, pornography, consent, psycho-sexual issues and gender equality. <\/p> <p>  The second area that could be focused on is the status of sexuality education.  It is very low at the moment; it does not have the status other subjects have.  In many schools it is not a priority.  Too often we see RSE as a subject to be left to the newest member of staff, and is usually squeezed in at the end of the school year.  For some schools it is a box-ticking exercise, while for others it really is delivered properly.  We believe there is a need for specialist knowledge and skills in RSE for teachers.  The reason for its low status is that it is not considered as a criterion for recruitment or promotion.  Many teachers would avoid the subject if possible.  Teachers have already spoken about the discomfort they experience around the teaching of RSE.  <\/p> <p>  The third area that could be improved is around capacity building for teachers and parents.   Finally, we believe the Department of Education and Skills must take the lead in making sure that the RSE programme is monitored and evaluated properly and that quality assurance is integrated into the structures.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Behan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank the members of the committee for asking me to speak today.  I want to make four main recommendations on behalf of Atheist Ireland.  Our first recommendation is that the recent referendum changes everything.  As legislators, members can no longer assume that even most Roman Catholic parents want Catholic sex education for their children.  Also, even if most parents in a particular area wanted Catholic sex education in the only local publicly funded school, that is still not a reason to deny the rights of the rest of the school community to objective sex education.  We have moved beyond the time for fine-tuning the religious discrimination and privilege in our schools.  We now need to move towards a secular, human rights-based school system that treats everybody equally.<br\/><br\/>Our second recommendation is that Atheist Ireland supports: mandatory provision of sexual and reproductive health education for adolescent girls and boys, as recommended by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2016; a single consistent curriculum for relationships and sexuality education across all schools, as recommended by the Ombudsman for Children in 2016; and scientifically objective, standardised, age-appropriate education on sexual and reproductive health and rights, as recommended by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in 2017.  The Minister for Education and Skills recently acknowledged in the D&aacute;il that young people have the right to get such factual information about sexual matters.<br\/><br\/>Our third recommendation is that having factual content is not enough, if that content is delivered through the religious ethos of a school patron body.  The content must be delivered in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner that avoids indoctrination outside of optional religion classes, as recommended by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in 2015, while ensuring a neutral studying environment, including in denominational schools outside of optional religious instruction classes, as raised with Ireland by the UN Human Rights Committee in 2014.<br\/><br\/>To do this the law will need to be amended because the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has no legal power over how the curriculum is delivered by school patron bodies with their own religious ethos.  We ask the Oireachtas to amend sections 9(<i>d<\/i>), 15(2)(<i>b<\/i>) and 30(2)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Education Act, which have been identified as problems by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in 2017.<br\/><br\/>Our fourth recommendation is that Atheist Ireland supports Solidarity&rsquo;s Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill, which broadly proposes the approach that we recommend.

For almost a decade, I have been doing research in the area of gender and sexuality in education, funded by several awards from the Irish Research Council.  The following is a summary of the changes I proposed in my written submission related to RSE content, teaching methods and structures.<\/p> <p>  On content changes, first, there an urgent need for comprehensive RSE that responds to the lived realities of children and young people&rsquo;s lives &ndash; what Renold and McGeeney call a \"living curriculum\" that assesses and meets the needs of children and young people at that stage in their lives.  Second, there is a necessity to uncover the deep silences that have surrounded lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities in RSE.  Third, I propose a move from sexuality as isolated and individualised towards critical consideration of sexuality as intersectional and caught up in broader power relations and cultural norms.<\/p> <p>  I propose the following changes to teaching methods.  First, we need to move from the overemphasis on risk to creating safe and ethical teaching and learning spaces that facilitate open and frank dialogue among children, parents and school staff.  Second, I propose that children and young people be more heavily involved in the co-construction of RSE.  Creative, arts-based methods have huge potential here.  Third, I suggest a critical approach to RSE that would avoid assumptions about young people or their lives, avoid tokenistic inclusion and be at peace with not having all the answers in advance.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the structural changes I propose are as follows.  First, we must take account of how fears around childhood innocence act as a barrier in ways that do not account for the capabilities of children or the wants of parents.  To be effective, comprehensive RSE must begin in early years, from as young as three, in partnership with parents.<\/p> <p>  Second, we know that many teachers and principals lack knowledge about and are uncomfortable with RSE.  Therefore, a comprehensive system of in-service training as well as new RSE specialist pathways in initial teacher education will be crucial here.<\/p> <p>  Third, uncertainties around religious ethos continue to constrain RSE.  There is an urgent need for clarity on how religious-run primary and post-primary schools can meet the RSE needs of all children equally.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, there is a necessity to ensure that there is strong RSE leadership in schools to steer a whole-school, spiral, sustained and meaningful approach to RSE in partnership with relevant local organisations.<\/p> <p>  Finally, on an ongoing basis, RSE should be informed, supported and evaluated by an RSE research, practice and education network that includes representation from key education stakeholders and expertise spanning the various topics encompassed by RSE.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that the recent developments in RSE in Wales and the recommendations made by the expert panel outlined in Renold and McGeeney&rsquo;s 2017 report should serve as an exemplary signpost for changes to RSE in Ireland.  Many of their recommendations are echoed across my written submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I am sure UL would never have forgiven us if we had transferred Dr. Neary to DCU by mistake.

I am also a member of the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre and of the Institute for Future Media and Journalism, both based at DCU.  My research is primarily concerned with issues relating to gender, sexuality and social media.  I am particularly interested in the topic of sex and sexuality education as it relates to the Internet and social media, as well as pornography.<\/p> <p>  I was a co-investigator on the Government-commissioned report on the sexualisation and commercialisation of children in Ireland and principal investigator on a recent study about LGBT inclusion in post-primary schools.<\/p> <p>  I will give a summary of my written submission.  I draw on existing research and literature in Ireland and elsewhere to identify the key problems have been identified with the Irish RSE curriculum and its delivery.  These are as follows.  The programme focuses largely on the avoidance of pregnancy and STIs.  The programme constructs heterosexual intercourse as the primary definition of sex.  The programme is not inclusive of LGBTQ students&rsquo; experiences and sexual practices.  The programme does not deal sufficiently with consent, although the senior cycle materials do contain a very good section on consent that was certainly progressive for its time.  The programme does not explicitly acknowledge sexism and inequality.  The programme does not deal with the role of the Internet, social media, mobile phones or pornography.  The programme does not start with young people&rsquo;s lived experiences.  As noted by Maycock, Kitching and Morgan in their 2007 review, significant problems have been observed with the delivery of the programme.<\/p> <p>  This last problem is the most significant and the one that presents the biggest challenge to improving RSE in our schools, not just in terms of time and expense but also in terms of impressing upon school boards of management that comprehensive RSE is a human right and not something that can be selectively addressed.<\/p> <p>  The international literature recommends that an overall shift in focus is required toward a rights and gender equality-based, inclusive, holistic, creative, empowering and protective RSE curriculum.  This again draws from Renold and McGeeney's research and recommendations in Wales.  This should be underpinned by key principles of sexual literacy and sexual citizenship.  This is of crucial importance, particularly in the digital context, because it shifts the emphasis away from risk, shame and self-censorship to rights, responsibility and self-empowerment.<\/p> <p>  The 2017 European Network of Ombudspersons for Children position statement on comprehensive relationship and sexuality education, states that all children and young people have the right to high-quality, holistic and inclusive education about sexuality and relationships.  A recent synthesis and review of international research on the views of children and young people suggests that high-quality RSE starts early; is adaptable and needs-led; offers a spiral curriculum; collaborates with external providers; is of sufficient duration; is engaging and participatory; and creates a safe, respectful and confidential learning environment.<\/p><p>To this end, I have suggested that the Irish relationship and sexuality education, RSE, programme should consider adapting the core principles underpinning the recent recommendations made on the future of the sex and relationships education curriculum in Wales.  These are rights and gender equity; creative and curious; empowering and transformative; experience-near and co-produced; holistic; inclusive; protective and preventative.  My more specific recommendations are for an RSE programme that moves beyond abstinence and pregnancy prevention to embrace issues of consent, negotiation and the dynamic, evolving nature of sexuality.  This summarises the points I made in my written submission and I am happy to expand on them and respond to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Debbie Ging","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ging.

The proposal envisages that first responder training be provided for specific identified individuals who are likely to be the first persons contacted about instances of non-consensual sexual activities, for example, tutors, students' union representatives, college societies, club presidents and officials.<\/p> <p>  That is a summary of the proposals and I will be pleased to discuss any further points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aidan Seery"},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Seery.

Non-formal education provided by youth work organisations is distinct from formal education but is complementary to it.  We believe youth work in general, especially For&oacute;ige, can offer the education system decades of expertise in enabling and equipping young people to develop the skills, confidence and knowledge to develop healthy relationships.  It can also offer a comprehensive evidence based relationships and sexuality programme, namely, For&oacute;ige&rsquo;s REAL U programme, which could be delivered in schools through an existing and ever growing network of skilled and trained facilitators.<\/p> <p>  The multitude of strategies, policies and initiatives in recent decades has resulted in a sense of confusion, with Government, schools and many community and voluntary organisations unsure of the best way to meet the needs of our young people to best support them to develop health and positive relationships in their lives.  This lack of clarity, combined with our extensive experience in non-formal education and feedback from young people about their dissatisfaction with sex education in schools, were the reasons we identified the need to develop this comprehensive programme.<\/p> <p>  The initial design of the REAL U programme was conducted by For&oacute;ige&rsquo;s best practice unit in 2012.  The curriculum design process started with an extensive review of national policy and strategy, and of best practice and what works nationally and internationally.  For&oacute;ige liaised with the expertise of organisations such as the HSE crisis pregnancy programme, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, BeLonG To and the Marie Keating Foundation to ensure the programme meets the wide-ranging needs of young people, and to ensure it provides a comprehensive and holistic approach to RSE.<\/p> <p>  The REAL U programme is more than just a sex education programme.  It is a personal development programme that equips young people with the skills, knowledge and confidence to develop healthy relationships, make responsible decisions on their sexual health and ultimately delay the onset of early sexual activity.  The programme is holistic in its approach to RSE and includes modules on gender and sexuality; emotional well-being; understanding boundaries; contraception and sexually transmitted infections, including a practical condom demonstration on correct use; sexual violence and the law; deciphering media messages; and understanding pornography.<\/p> <p>  In 2014, the programme underwent an extensive evaluation by the UNESCO Child and Family Research Centre, National University of Ireland, Galway.  Among the key findings from the evaluation were that the programme was effective in engaging young people, responding to their needs and impacting on their knowledge and attitudes in the area of RSE.  Young people said they would recommend this programme to other young people because they felt the programme was relevant, insightful and they felt better informed and more aware of the consequences of their actions.  The research also identified statistically significant effects in young people's attitude to members of the LGBTI+ community, and 100% of those who trained in facilitating the programme said it was effective in meeting its outcomes.<\/p> <p>  With the support of the HSE crisis pregnancy programme, to date For&oacute;ige has trained more than 1,100 professionals from organisations and disciplines, including youth organisations, the HSE, ISPCC, the school completion programme, Tusla, residential care centres, family resource centres and those who work with young people and adults with intellectual disabilities.  These trained facilitators of the REAL U programme run the programme with young people and service users nationwide and evaluations of the facilitator training and the programme have been consistently overwhelmingly positive.  For&oacute;ige&rsquo;s REAL U programme has been called the gold standard in RSE in Ireland.  As such, we currently cannot meet demand for the REAL U facilitator training and the waiting list stands at more than 200.<\/p> <p>  We believe the REAL U programme meets the needs of modern Irish young people.  It has been extensively and rigorously tested, evaluated and proven to do so.  If we wait for a new programme to be written and teachers to be recruited and trained, we will fail a large number of young people by further delaying their needs being met.  In recent months, we received a tenfold increase in the number of school teachers contacting us about the programme.  We currently cannot meet this need.  The REAL U programme offers everything the Government announced it wishes to have as part of the reform of the RSE curriculum.  The programme is ready to go and ready to be rolled out in schools.  While it has been written for young people rather than schools, we are willing to meet the Department of Education and Skills to discuss how the programme can be adapted for the school context.  We recommend that the Government invest in large-scale training of youth services and community organisations to deliver the REAL U programme in all schools while the schools ready themselves to deliver it.<\/p> <p>  For&oacute;ige's REAL U programme is the gold standard in RSE.  Young people, now and in future, deserve to have access to the programme.  We are ready and willing to work together to make that a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Haslam"},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Haslam.

The Health Service Executive welcomes the review of RSE being undertaken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  I have worked in this area for 12 years and I and my colleague have made a detailed written submission to the committee.  I will outline the main points of the submission and our thoughts on the review of RSE.  I will also respond to any questions committee members may have.<\/p> <p>  RSE is a strategic focus of the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.  As outlined in our submission, we have commissioned a range of research studies and developed a range of resource materials and training for parents, teachers and youth workers in partnership with a number of different organisations, including the Department of Education and Skills, the Professional Development Service for Teachers, the National Youth Council of Ireland, For&oacute;ige, Tusla, the National Parents Council and the Irish Family Planning Association.<\/p><p>Overall, the evidence indicates that young people are more likely to receive sex education now than in the past and they are more likely to say that it was helpful to them.  Young people who felt that they had good quality relationships and sexuality education were more likely to use contraception at first sex.  Contraceptive use among young people in Ireland is very high, with approximately 80% of young people reporting use of contraception, and there as been a decline of 66% in the number of births to teenagers since 2001, and a 75% decline in the numbers of teenagers accessing abortion services since 2001.<\/p><p> While these findings are positive, we acknowledge that there is more to relationships in sexuality education than preventing crisis pregnancy.  Sexuality education should emphasise the importance of supporting young people to understand themselves and develop healthy relationships with others.  Students should be facilitated to explore and question how our society understands gender, power and sexual expression in an age-appropriate way.  Several research reports have indicated that teachers find relationships and sexuality education, RSE, challenging to teach and require more professional development to improve their confidence and competence levels.  It is our view that any revised curriculum on its own will not be sufficient to change practice unless it is supported by a comprehensive and potentially accredited continuing professional development, CPD, programme for teachers in social, personal and health education, SPHE, and RSE.<\/p><p> SPHE is the only subject at post-primary level where there is no accredited professional qualification and this contributes to the lack of status of the subject in some schools.  We note and welcome that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, review will include advice on implementation of the curriculum in schools.  <\/p><p> Another barrier to consider is that while RSE is taught within the context of SPHE from primary level to junior cycle, SPHE is still optional at senior cycle.  This means that schools are required to teach six classes of RSE per year at senior cycle, but are not required to teach it within the context of SPHE.  This makes RSE more difficult to timetable and more difficult to teach because the teachers might not have the opportunity to build up a relationship with the class on other health education topics before addressing RSE.  Surveys and inspection reports by the Department of Education and Skills have consistently found that RSE implementation decreases significantly in senior cycle.  This is a concern because 16 to 18 year olds may be starting romantic relationships and dealing with break ups during their senior cycle years.<\/p><p> The committee may be interested to know that ourselves and the Department of Education and Skills have commissioned Dublin City University, DCU, to undertake a piece of research on RSE in post-primary schools to develop a more nuanced understanding of how the RSE programme is implemented.  Students, parents and teachers have been interviewed.  The findings are due at the end of the year and I understand they will contribute to the NCCA review.

The Irish Family Planning Association and For&oacute;ige, among others, deliver their own modules or their own support.  Would an answer to this be to provide funding to outside groups, such as these groups, subject to being suitably quality controlled, to provide more of what they already do?  We have teachers who do not like doing this and who do not feel equipped.  The NCCA, with all due respect to it, takes forever to deal with this and it does not react quickly to changes, etc.  The curriculum that is there is 20 years old.

It needs to be inclusive because part of the problem is that it is very good in some schools - whether it is delivered from outside sources or internally - but not good at all in other schools.

We did not have many references to ethos in the presentations today, with the exception of Ms Donnelly and Dr. Neary.  We did in previous sessions.  One of the problems, currently, is that much sex education is presented through the prism of the school's ethos.  I do not know who would like to answer this but should that change fundamentally?

I come from a teaching background and many teachers are uncomfortable with it, as are many adults who are not teachers.  It can be a difficult topic for parents to discuss with their own children.  Proper training in teacher training colleges, leadership within the school and an open dialogue among staff makes it much easier for teachers.  Continuous professional development, CPD, courses are critical.  They exist for every other subject and this should not be excluded.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by Rape Crisis Network Ireland's explanation that four Departments and at least six strategies and policies have a role in shaping sexual health education.  Notwithstanding all the consultation alluded to - with young people involved in the structure, as well as all the different key agencies - should the lead be taken by one Department?  I refer to making sure that we have a comprehensive curriculum for RSE.  How can we also get around the teaching of factual sex education despite the ethos of the school?  Religion could be a separate class - where the ethos of the school, whatever it is, could be taught - but sex education would involve the facts and giving young people all the information they need on all of the issues.

As for the comment on whether we all would love more funding, of course we all would.  That is not, however, why we are here and not what we are advocating for.  We are advocating for quality, comprehensive, holistic relationship and sexuality education for young people.  It is already happening in the youth work sector and has been for years.

A bank of professionals are already doing this who can go into schools and do it now - should that investment be there - while teachers are getting themselves ready.  It should not be a case where a teacher or non-teacher is shoved into doing this.  It is correct to say that this is not for everybody.  The teachers who are willing to do it, however - those who have come to us and said that they are willing, ready and able - should be resourced and supported.  <\/p> <p>  It is a different type of learning.  It is negotiated learning - while there are facts, young people also have to be allowed the opportunity to learn for themselves and to develop a skill set around positive relationships.

The investment should be in sharing that among the informal and the formal sector.  The members were correct on what they said on ethos.  It should be an objective programme.

Those are the Talking Relationships, Understanding Sexuality Teaching Resource, TRUST, for the senior cycle and B4UDecide for junior cycle. B4UDecide is being updated at present.  It is important to acknowledge that there is already a support service doing this work and training many teachers.  That is not the big problem.<\/p> <p>  The problem is that there is a revolving door of teachers attending training because the teachers are moved.  They might teach SPHE one year, then it is changed and they are not teaching SPHE the following year.  Teachers are not being given the opportunity to build on professional experience and to develop professionally in this area.  In an ideal world, teachers would go to ten days of training and that would be accredited.  Those teachers would build up professional expertise and then would be a resource within the school.  That would make it less likely that the principal will move them on or chop and change the team.  I understand that there are issues with contracts and changes are needed on occasion.  The main point, however, is that the issue is not that we do not have people who can train in RSE.  We do have people who can do that - the pedagogues here are doing it - but it is just one day and not being built upon year on year.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the answer is an accredited programme in SPHE and RSE.<\/p><p>When we are at that stage we would, as always, be working in partnership with the people who have expertise in this area, in addition to the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST.<\/p><p> In response to the question on ethos, a research study was conducted a number of years ago by Paula Mayock, Karl Kitching and Mark Morgan on RSE implementation at post-primary level involving nine schools.  One school was picked out as an excellent example of RSE delivery.  It was a single sex boys' Catholic school, which shows that it is possible to have good RSE taught in schools that have a Catholic ethos.  I am not saying it happens all of the time but it would be wrong not to acknowledge that many teachers and principals are teaching comprehensive RSE even though they are in Catholic schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#K01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla McGowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Ms Jane Donnelly is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#L00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I would like to respond to the ethos issue.  All children have a right to objective sex education.  Article 42.3.2&deg;. of the Constitution requires that children receive \"a certain minimum education\" including moral, intellectual and social.  Sexual education fits in under the social heading.  The Constitution does not say anything about religious or Catholic sex education.  One could say that the State is failing in its duty to provide objective sex education to most pupils because in most schools the sex education provided is Catholic.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, the Catholic Church has issued guidelines on RSE.  Most schools do not tell parents that the sex education provided to pupils is Catholic.  Catholic sex education is being integrated into the State's RSE curriculum.  The church in its guidelines states that because RSE is an integral part of both the religious education curriculum and the SPHE curriculum, schools are not required to ask parents to sign a permission slip to allow their child to attend lessons in the sensitive area of sex education.  Minority, non-religious and Catholic parents who do not want their children to receive Catholic sex education are not being told that this is happening.  They do not know that their children are getting Catholic sex education which is integrated into the State course.<\/p> <p>  There are two issues at play here.  The first is the fact that children have a right to objective sex education and we believe that the State is failing in its duty to provide same.  The second is the fact that parents do not know that they can opt out of Catholic sex education for their children, which is what is being taught in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Donnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Mr. Niall Behan is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#L00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I wish to respond to two questions, the first of which was on the role of outside facilitators.  We agree with what a number of speakers have said on the matter of a whole-school approach and that RSE should be based in schools.  That said, our role could be around complementing that process, helping with resources or with particular aspects of delivering the programme.  Problems arise when the outside facilitators become the deliverers of the whole RSE programme and it becomes a box-ticking exercise.<\/p> <p>  The question of ethos can be quite complex.  Ethos ties into the teachers' discomfort with the content of programme.  There is a worry about the ethos of the school and about whether, for example, a teacher should be talking about contraception.  That is part of what gives the RSE programme its low status.  The UK authorities tried to improve the status of RSE a number of years ago by making involvement in it a requirement for promotion to school principal.  That brought more teachers into the RSE programme there and encouraged them to stick with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Behan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Our next contributor is Dr. Aoife Neary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#L00600","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>There are two central issues with religious ethos, the first being clarity.

There are many children who are religious, who have religious affiliations or cultural affiliations intermingled with religion and RSE needs to address those issues.  There is a requirement for a space where there is open and healthy conversation around providing all of the facts - the comprehensive RSE programme - while also acknowledging the tensions between religion and sexuality.  Obviously, it will require very experienced teachers who have the ability to create a safe, ethical, open and respectful space in RSE classrooms for that to happen.  It does a disservice to people who are religious to talk about sexuality as somehow separate from that because sexuality is core to humanness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife Neary"},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I will go back to members now.

I have dealt with many people who have used the services of rape crisis centres which has made a very positive impact on their lives.<\/p><p>I agree with a lot of what Dr. Neary and Dr. Ging have said about the need for more inclusion of children and young people themselves.  Often we do not realise the extent to which young people are clued in.  I also agree that parents should be included more.  They are included in almost every other aspects of their child's education.  They receive emails, texts and so on about what is going on generally, but when it comes to RSE, it is often a question of a brief mention or a booklet being given at a parent-teacher meeting.<\/p><p>The key questions for me are around what is being delivered in schools, how it is being delivered and who is overseeing the delivery of RSE.  It is the lack of oversight that has led to the delivery of RSE being so <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  Some schools and teachers are very good while others are very uncomfortable and not so good.  While I take on board the points made about avoiding outsourcing, which I would not generally favour, perhaps there is a role for a combined approach involving, for example, teachers and the Irish Family Planning Association.  Perhaps we need to think about providing some external support for teachers so that it is not just them in the classroom, because clearly for some, it is an uncomfortable topic.  What needs to be done so that RSE delivery is not so uncomfortable for teachers?  What can we do to ensure that they do not shy away from it?  The teachers who are good at it are comfortable with it and we need to ensure that this is the case for all teachers.<\/p><p>I agree that RSE must be delivered by schools.  While RSE also requires the involvement of parents and families, it must be provided at school and in every class.  At the moment, it only seems to be provided to older classes, and for some children, unfortunately, that is too late.

I thank the Chairman for explaining that to our guests.  I read the written submissions in advance of the meeting and managed to catch the end of Ms McGowan's presentation.   What I found quite striking was the fact that SPHE is the only post-primary subject for which there is no professional, accredited qualification.  That is quite shocking and it certainly explains why teachers would feel uncomfortable.  It seems unfair to both students and teachers alike and it also goes some way to explaining the difficulties around RSE timetabling.  It has become a difficulty for principals, in truth.  They are faced with trying to squash it in and selecting a poor, unfortunate teacher to teach it.  That is the way it is treated in schools, which is shocking given its importance for our children.<\/p><p>It is appalling.  On the issue of ethos, I do not know how to reconcile the delivery of relationships and sexuality education in line with the ethos of the school with a circular being issued to schools instructing them to ensure RSE is objective and does not withhold or censor.  There is a little confusion for school management.<\/p><p> My question for Dr. Debbie Ging relates to the research that has been done.  She said the Department of Education and Skills and HSE have commissioned the survey.  Is the survey related purely to the experience of the teachers, parents and students with how RSE is taught in schools or has it been widened to ascertain young people's thoughts, experiences, knowledge and what they feel is needed with regard to relationships, sexuality and consent?<\/p><p> A question for all the witnesses relates to age appropriate material.  How do we determine what is age appropriate so that we the age right and do not deliver RSE too early or late?  How is that ascertained or determined?  Do some schools have an RSE policy in place while others do not?  How does that work?  Why do some schools have a policy while others do not?  After a whole-school evaluation of management, leadership and learning, or MLL as it is known, has been completed, do inspectors comment on the merits of the school's RSE policy or ask why it does not have an RSE policy in place?  Has the Department highlighted this in any way?  Do we know what the position is regarding feedback from inspections?  It seems bizarre not to have a policy on RSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#L01100","speaker":"1242","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Martin for her comments and questions.  On the status of social, personal and health education, SPHE, in schools, the Deputy is right that it is sometimes a headache for principals with regard to timetabling.  The well-being curriculum that is coming on track in junior cycle will increase the status of SPHE and RSE in schools.  It will take a few years for that to embed.  With this RSE review, there are positive things on the horizon.<\/p> <p>  With regard to ethos, I agree that the current approach does not make much sense.  It is not clear how a teacher will be able to teach about inclusivity and respect for diversity, and at the same time adhere to a Catholic ethos.  I might not have made that point clear earlier but ethos should not come into relationships and sexuality education.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's questions on RSE policy, all schools are required by the Department to have an RSE policy.  The most recent study, the Lifeskills Survey 2015, showed that approximately 90% of schools have a policy, 8% are working on one and 2% have no policy in place.  It is one of the areas the inspectorate will examine when carrying out inspections on RSE.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the research study.  She may have been referring to the study we commissioned.  It is a study of the views of students, principals, teachers and parents about RSE delivery in their school.  We designed it like that because we were hearing so many mixed reports about RSE in schools.  On the one hand, we had large numbers of teachers attending training and we had developed new resources that were evaluating really well.  However, on the other hand, young people were still saying they were not getting RSE.  We want to find out what is going on and why teachers think they are providing RSE whereas young people say they are not getting it.  What is missing?  We hope the report will shed some light on that issue for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":288,"content":"<p>Does the study focus solely on the delivery of RSE without ascertaining the experience or knowledge of relationships or sexuality among young people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#M00300","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>No.  It asks a general question and is open-ended, rather than structured.

Approximately 70% of schools are using this approach, which was developed in 2009 and requires an update.  This is the resource the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, currently uses in its training in RSE.  At junior cycle, it is B4UDecide, which is supported by a website, <i>b4udecide.ie<\/i>, and approximately 66% of schools report that they use B4UDecide.  We have not yet developed materials at primary level.  We have the &quot;Busy Bodies&quot; booklet which is for fifth and sixth class, with a DVD to accompany it, and we have recently published guidance for parents on talking to their young child about relationships, sexuality and growing up, with a little booklet for younger children called &quot;Tom's Power Flower&quot; that goes into the very basics of the human body and how babies are made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Orla McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528815600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McGowan.

The first comment was about parents.  Relationships and sexuality education does not start and end in school.  Parents should be supported in this.  In our experience, before we start any of our programmes, we arrange an information night for parents where they are given many of the resources.  When they leave those meetings, they have comprehensive knowledge of what we will cover in our programme and they are supported throughout the programme.  They should be able to have these conversations at home.  They know they are started and developed by us but they can continue to have them at home.  Parents need to be supported and involved in this.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the comment on teachers and teachers being unsure or unwilling, when teachers come to us and want to use our programme, it is striking that they have heard, believe and know that this is a comprehensive programme that has been tried and tested.  They feel confident within that.  If I am given a curriculum that is really good, that everybody else says is really good and has gone through rigorous testing and evaluation, that will support me.  Another response that we receive from teachers is that they want to receive ongoing feedback from us.  We have a training department.  In addition to providing training, we also offer continuous support through newsletters, telephone calls and other types of support.  That is really important.  There is an issue if there is no continuing professional development, CPD, or adequate training.  What is required is training plus follow-up and continued support.<\/p> <p>  On age appropriate content, the programme that we have is for young people aged 12 to 18 years.  It is divided into core modules, of which there are six, and every participant in the programme does the core modules.  We train our facilitators to be able to identify particular needs as the programme starts and finishes.  They choose a number of elective modules based on the needs, the age and the awareness of the young people in question.  This approach, where we have a core programme and a number of elective modules that can be facilitated afterwards, ensures that core learning, development and outcomes are achieved for all young people who participate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Haslam"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I think Ms McGowan answered Deputy Martin's question.  I am not leading the research.  My colleague, Dr. Mel Duffy, in the school of nursing, is leading it.  It brings up a really important question about research.  We are seeing that much of the research on delivery of the programme is piecemeal and out of date.  Having bits and pieces of research, regardless of their quality or importance, is not sufficiently comprehensive.  A starting point would be to commission national level, large-scale research that addresses young people's perceptions and experiences of RSE, their needs, where they are and what they are doing sexually, and what their perceptions of the programme are.<\/p><p>Otherwise I do not think we are ever going to get to what is age appropriate or what is actually going on.  How do we start with a student-led programme unless we actually know what is happening on some sort of reliable, representative scale?  That is probably a better starting point than trying to join up a lot of different pieces of research.  It is small funding; it is very good research but the funding and therefore the scale is not adequate.<\/p><p> In response to Deputy Funchion's question as to what teachers should do, one of the recommendations made by the Welsh RSE review was to make it mandatory to appoint an RSE lead in every school in the country.  That recommendation has now been adopted.  If there are external bodies, that person can act as a liaison with them and he or she is also ultimately responsible for the ethos within the school.

What is coming through is that there is something about the specialisation and professionalisation of this role in terms of sexual health.  We know from our work that there are transferable and generalisable, mainstreamable tools that we can give teachers.  However, as Ms Haslam has said, we renew and review the content of that curriculum very regularly.  We talk about ethos and objective in very particular ways in this debate but one thing we really need to grapple with is that once we get beyond a certain basic level of facts, we are dealing with culture.  We are engaging with and asking questions of culture and therefore we have to keep up to date with that, in terms of being led by the children's needs and their lived realities.  To do that, we need someone in place who has a specialisation and is supported within a structure.  I am inclining more towards the Department of Education and Skills having a set of professionals in this area who have standing, status and support and who are able to carry out that continual review because they are all the time upskilling and learning from the children they are engaging with.  We really have to be aware that we are dealing with culture here and with equipping and upskilling children to get through the ever-changing challenges they are facing.<\/p> <p>  The rape crisis centres were mentioned.  In terms of infrastructure, there is no funding stream for the 16 rape crisis centres around the country to draw on to do the primary prevention work in schools.  A lot of them find ways to do it but they do not have any funding.  Rape Crisis Network Ireland has no funding to do this work or this thinking.  The bank of personnel and the resources must be there.  There must be some part of government that is watchful, mindful and responsible for this and that has cross-departmental, whole-of-government capacity and authority.  In the absence of these things, I wonder about what falls through the cracks.  We end up developing a set of tools that go out of date and nobody is keeping an eye on the situation.<\/p> <p>  On the question of uncomfortableness around this issue, sexual violence prevention has had a hard time getting onto the sexual health agenda and curriculum.  One of the reasons, which we address head on, for example in the REAL U programme, is that there is confusion about role.  We have to ask ourselves why we do not have a sexual harassment policy for our schools.  It is a glaring gap that nobody is asking about.  There are lots of reasons for this, one of which is that we move into the criminal sphere very quickly when we talk about sexual violence.  That is why I emphasised primary and secondary prevention.  If we are to build up a bank of professionals around primary prevention, this educational piece, we will need to be very clear to them that they are not investigators, that the child protection and children first aspects of the responsibility of the schools happens elsewhere and they are not going to be doing that work as well.

Mr. Niall Behan raised a really important point about the gender aspect of the impact of inadequate sex education, which falls disproportionately on women.  Would he or other witnesses expand on this gendered impact element?  Other anecdotal evidence suggests there is a gendered difference in how sex education is delivered.  Boys get one form of sex education that, anecdotally, seems to be less in terms of fewer minutes per year or whatever, and which includes very little in terms of consent.  Young women probably get more minutes although it is still completely inadequate in terms of time and the gatekeeper model, whereby it is their role not to have improper or unsafe sex, is put on them in particular.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Aoife Neary raised a really interesting point about the idea of childhood innocence, which is something we hear about a lot around this topic, particularly when we get into the idea of age appropriateness and the idea that sex education can start from as young as three.  People say we should not be taking away childhood innocence.  It reflects the fact that a section of society sees sexuality as something from which young people should be shielded and as a negative as opposed to its being part of humanity and part of who we are.  Could Dr. Neary unpack that a little?  What does age-appropriate RSE look like for children at three, five and seven years?

There can either be a board of a school or a principal directing that a certain bit will not really be taught and when another bit is taught, account will be taken of the religious ethos of the school, which can cause direct interference or which can interfere indirectly as the perception of religious ethos or pressure leads to teachers shying away from really going there, even if the curriculum exists on paper.  That arose when representatives from the teacher unions came before us.  The major issue, as touched on by Ms Donnelly, is that there is a legislative basis for the confusion and contradictory messages of the Department of Education and Skills.  The legislative basis is the Education Act 1998, with the reference to having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school.  It is quite fundamental and I am interested in the opinions of the witnesses on this.  We cannot have progressive, modern, sex-positive RSE without dealing with that.  One must deal with that by amending the Education Act.

We need to ensure that both young men and women get the appropriate sex education in the proper way, with clarity and the appropriate facts.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar and Ms McGowan spoke about B4UDecide, which seems to be a really good resource.  They, and particularly Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar, highlighted that there are a significant number of resources and networks that are available for teachers and schools but there seems to be an issue with schools taking that on board.  There is a space for co-ordination that absolutely needs to happen.  I would imagine there is a role for all of those within a new model of RSE.  If much of the work has been done, we do not need to reinvent the wheel but rather ensure it comes together and is coherent.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Seery spoke about the use of student facilitators with appropriate roles, and that is a really good model.  Is it something that would be effective at post-primary level in terms of peer support?  There is also the issue of choosing young people for it, as it is a very important role in itself.  It might be helpful and supportive for younger students, particularly with the idea of gender equality officers.  I mentioned at a meeting before how I was struck by a Comhairle na n&Oacute;g workshop that I attended.  There was a real concern among young people in post-primary school about the lack of support they felt was evident for those who are identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual, LGBT.  It is something we could do much with.  For&oacute;ige's Relationships Explored and Life Uncovered, REAL U, programme has absolutely been noted as a gold standard.  It has been mentioned at some of our other meetings as well.  Have schools ever asked for For&oacute;ige to come in and deliver that?  The group has an existing network of trained facilitators and this would be important for us.<\/p> <p>  This is an ongoing debate about internal versus external approaches and there should be a mix of both.  When there are experts in the area, as outlined by Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar, we need those people with an incredible wealth of knowledge and experience in dealing with specific situations.  We all know that sometimes some young people will open up more or take more from somebody they may not see again.  They feel more free about it.  Equally, it is vital that there would be a support mechanism within every school.  It is the notion of having somebody whose responsibility is to ensure a robust RSE policy is delivered.  They should have that adequate training - the ten-day training mentioned by Ms McGowan - and ensure that there is a holistic view in the school.  The teacher should have that as an absolute responsibility within middle management.  There is an issue relating to inspection or vetting of external people coming to schools.  It is important in the context of setting a policy.<\/p> <p>  I could go on for a while but I will not.  I will go to Ms Haslam and Dr. Neary first as they indicated a wish to speak at the end of the previous contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#O00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>To respond to Deputy Funchion, who brought up evaluation, it is key and it brings legitimacy.  Recommendation No. 9 of the Informing the Future of the Sex and Relationships Education Curriculum in Wales report is the inspection of RSE in a very formal way as part of an inspectorate's work.  It should come in tandem with research support and the evaluation aspect of a network that would take in the spiral notion of the curriculum and continuing professional development and training, which should happen in a meaningful way.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Paul Murphy asked about age appropriateness.  A number of international studies mention age appropriateness, including Pound <i>et al.<\/i>, as I mentioned.  That was a review of RSE in ten different countries across 25 years that mentions the spiral curriculum needing to happen from early years, which is a significant finding.  It would be from age three onwards.  Professor Emma Reynold's work in the UK explores how children are not too young in a primary school context to engage with the concepts of RSE, gender and sexuality and so on.  In the US context, Ryan <i>et al.<\/i>and Martino and Cummin-Potvin's work illustrates how primary age children from as young as four can make sense of and question structures of disadvantage and privilege related to gender and sexuality in an age appropriate way, of course, and in partnership with parents.  Robinson and Davies have, in an Australian context, work relating to early childhood and caution against this notion of age appropriateness policing us and we should not make assumptions about what is age appropriateness but rather speak with children and young people and find out where they are.  It is a notion of the living curriculum.  Another aspect is the fear that this might be for parents at this age.  The problem with just being educated by parents is that the most vulnerable in our society will not get the same education for RSE.  For a fair and equal system, it should be comprehensively across the board and across all primary schools.<br\/><br\/>Renold speaks about consent as something that can be talked about from early years, such as three onwards, and taking in concepts of refusal, language and communication.  The three year old might say &quot;I do not like that&quot;.  We can start with such simple language.  Similarly, with LGBT identities, the INTO LGBT teacher group introduced a resource called &quot;Different Families, Same Love&quot;, and it again has age-appropriate language usable from four onwards which mentions love, mammy and mammy, mammy and daddy, daddy and daddy, and the variety of family forms, including mammy on her own, daddy on his own and others that could be evident.  It makes it very real and possible from early ages and there is nothing to be frightened about.<\/p><p> I welcome Deputy Paul Murphy's comment about amending the Education Act 1998.  From an LGBT perspective, amending section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 would remove chill factor for teachers in respect of being recruited and dismissed.  In a study I did on primary schools to explore homophobia and transphobia, we found that teachers are afraid to approach these topics because they are afraid of the reaction of parents and that in some way it is contrary to the ethos of the school.  That ambiguity needs to be cleared up and the amendment of the Education Act would be an excellent place to start from that perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I would like to make two points in response to Deputy Paul Murphy, the first of which is about gender.  We do not agree with splitting the curriculum in terms of gender.  Our curriculum is for all genders and everybody participates in all aspects of it.  One of the core modules of this programme relates to gender and sexuality, which we sought advice on from BeLonG To, and we continue to work with it to update that.  It is one of the key modules in this programme that has seen significant effects statistically in terms of young people's attitudes towards members of the LGBTI+ community.<\/p> <p>  I echo what Dr. Aoife Neary said on age and taking away innocence.  A spiral curriculum is what we would recommend and that key pieces of learning must start early and continue to be repeated and built on as young people age.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked if we have been asked about this by teachers.  They are beating down our door seeking this curriculum but we face two barriers in that regard.  First, we cannot replace the educational curriculum; we cannot come in and replace what is provided.  We are seeking to be the named as the curriculum.  The second barrier is the cut in our core funding.  We had a 33% cut in our core funding of which only 7.5% has been restored.  That has impacted on our resources and on young people accessing the programme.  This year, we have 200 people waiting on a list to be trained to facilitate this programme.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to what Dr. Saidl&eacute;ar said, if we continue to research, talk and write curricula from the beginning, we are failing our young people now.  There are curricula available.  We are an example of one that has been tested robustly.  It is our job to work with young people and to ensure our curriculum and programmes meet the needs of young people.  Young people are constantly inputting into this curriculum, which is the reason we have to continue to update it.<\/p> <p>  There is no point reinventing the wheel.  We are calling for this to be the named curriculum and for the Government to invest in, and fund schools, to allow them access the current network of trained and skilled professionals to come into schools and to train teachers who are in a position to cover this curriculum to the standard to which we train them, and be supported by us on an ongoing basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Haslam"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I would like to respond to Deputy Paul Murphy's question on the area of childhood innocence.  We did some research with parents of four to nine year old children on talking to young children about growing up, relationships and sexuality to support us and they raised the issues of giving them too much information, childhood innocence and so on.  However, the overwhelming response from parents was that they wanted to do a better job than their own parents in this area.  They believed it was important that their children received RSE but they were stuck regarding the language, what they should say, when they should say it, how not to say too much while providing enough information and so on.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the response to that, when a parent asks how they should teach a three year old about RSE, we tell them that they are doing it.  Whether they think they are doing it, if they are in a relationship with their children, they are giving them information on how they should feel about their body, what it is to be a boy or a girl and naming their feelings.  By the time the children are four they will be asked where babies come from and, therefore, all those areas constitute RSE at the age of three, for example, as Deputy Murphy mentioned.<\/p> <p>  At the age of seven, it is still the same education.  The children might get some information in the school curriculum but young people ask questions long before the topic is dealt with in the school.  That might be appropriate because children develop at different rates and the primary responsibility for RSE is with parents.  Parents are asked these questions constantly.  A seven year old might be curious about the different types of love.  They might ask, \"Who do you love more?  Me, Daddy or Granny?\"  Those are the types of questions they will ask and when parents respond to those questions, they are talking to the children about different types of love.  Questions might arise from school.  For example, children might ask the reason another student has two mums or two dads, and the parent will answer that.  That is RSE.  We talk about privacy and nudity in terms of who is and is not allowed see them without clothes.  There are also general messages about children having a positive body image.<\/p> <p>  International guidance on age appropriate sexuality education developed by the World Health Organization, WHO, is available but the main point is that parents are doing it anyway.

Under their contract, teachers are obliged to uphold the religious ethos of the school.  They are in the position, therefore, if they give objective sex education in schools under religious patronage, they are in breach of their employment contract.

That is one of the reasons I have spoken on a few occasions about the need for a sexual harassment policy.<\/p> <p>  In the programmes we are involved in, boys and girls are together in the classroom but, as a facilitator and an educator, we are clearly looking at power dynamics and the different expectation that are based on gender.  When we commissioned the research, Young people, Alcohol and Sex: What's consent got to do with it?, it surprised us that young people said there is no difference between men and women, boys and girls, they are all empowered now, they can all say \"Yes\" and \"No\", and that everything is fantastic.  However, when we scratched the surface of that regarding scenarios that were questionable such as sexual violence and sexual consent, in the quick responses on who is the gatekeeper in terms of responsibility and blame, strict gender roles were outlined.<\/p> <p>  Delivering the curriculum in the classroom is one thing but what happens when those children walk out into the corridor?  Unless we have a sophisticated understanding of the gendered, sexist and misogynistic world they are stepping into in the corridor, we may have equipped them poorly to engage.  If we do not empower them to stand up for themselves and call out, say, the sexual assault they experience as soon as they step out into that corridor, what have we done as institutions to ensure they are in a safe place in terms of the power dynamics going on in that corridor?<\/p><p>When we have delivered our curriculum, have we also done our homework on the context they step out into?  That is why I talk about a sexual harassment action plan for schools, a national policy on how we do that and create safe spaces in the school environment.  We have a template, 'Safe and Supportive' that BeLonG To spoke about.  It is an excellent piece of work.  Why do we not have that for sexual harassment?  We would like to think about how this curriculum is enacted in children's lives when they step back into the real world and whether we have empowered them in ways that are unintentionally unsafe because we have not taken care of context outside the classroom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018061200002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cl&iacute;ona Saidl&eacute;ar","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528815600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I am conscious that the experience in TCD provides us with a small knowledge base and I admit that I have no experience of schools or schooling.

A total of 25% of them come from international backgrounds and while many have had a religion-based education but every one of them comes into a consent workshop with a set of attitudes, dispositions and world views.

I acknowledge that she has gone to a lot of trouble to be here with us.  It is appreciated.  We are here to discuss the European Commission's proposals for the future funding of the EU budget.  This week, in particular, is important in the Brexit negotiations, given what is going on in England.  Even as late last night, events were happening very quickly.  We have to be ready and on top of our game to ensure we will be poised to react in a positive way for the country.  The discussions on how the European Union should be financed and finance itself are at the core of how we see the Union working in the future.  This has been the subject of much discussion in the past few months.  The committee has played its part in bringing in different delegates.  The European Commission has published its own recommendations in several parts.  The European Union's budget is important as it defines the type of Union we want and provides for member states and citizens directly in a number of vital areas such as research and rural communities.  The United Kingdom's departure from the European Union and the impact it will have on the Union's budget also need to be taken into account.<\/p><p> We are delighted that Ms Brown is in a position to join us for an engagement so soon after the package was published.  It is an excellent initiative in order that we can have early discussions on how the European Commission sees it.  Member states are, no doubt, looking at the detail for their own discussions at the Council and in the European Parliament.  I am sure all Members of the Oireachtas will have comments and suggestions to make.  I have no doubt that several committees will look at the parts of the proposals with most relevance to their work.  I know that several members of other committees wanted to join us, but, unfortunately, as I outlined, they are unable to do so.  I ask Ms Brown to make her opening statement.

It is a great honour and privilege for me to be here as they will hear from my accent.  Although I have been living in Brussels for 17 years, I am from Dublin.  I thank the joint committee for inviting me.  \"A modern budget for a Union that protects, empowers and defends\" is the proposal the European Commission put forward on 2 May in its communication on the Multi-annual Financial Framework, MFF, for the period 2020 to 2027, inclusive.  In the coming months there will be many negotiations, analysis, discussion of figures, numbers and percentages, but we are not simply talking about figures, numbers and percentages.  This is the political project the Commission wants to put forward for the future of Europe.<\/p> <p>  This is the first MFF for 27 member states, bound together by solidarity which began at the beginning of the process.  It has been prepared by way of a very inclusive process, involving open public consultation during which more than 11,000 responses were receiving, talking to beneficiaries of EU funding, Members of the European Parliament, member states and national parliaments, Commissioner Oettinger, the Commissioner with responsibility for the budget, abd travelling to all member states to engage.  This political process which has been brought along by the Commission's White Paper, various reflection papers and papers from the European Parliament has been accompanied by an in-depth spending review by the Commission of existing programmes because we want to learn from what has been done up until now, take the best from it and build on it.  <\/p> <p>  The main messages from the Commission's extensive consultations were clear.  We need a stronger focus on European added value.  Where can we do best when we pool our resources, whether it be in research, the digital economy, cross-border connections or dealing with the challenges Europe faces from migration?<\/p><p>In addition, what can we do better, given we cannot do it as individual member states, whether it is in regard to fusion, energy or space?<\/p><p> We need a more streamlined and transparent budget.  The Commission's proposal reduces the number of programmes by more than a third and brings fragmented funding together into new integrated programmes, for example, for the Single Market by bringing together the support for small and medium size enterprises through COSME, along with statistical and health programmes, and streamlining the use of financial instruments.  \"Less red tape\" is a constant refrain but the idea now is to have a single rule book and to reduce the administrative burden, not only for the beneficiaries but also for the managing authorities, so we can facilitate participation in EU programmes and accelerate their implementation.  We need a flexible budget.  Unforeseen things happen and we need to be able to redirect expenditure both within programmes and between them in order to face challenges, whether those challenges come from economic shocks, migrations or natural disasters.<\/p><p> Overall, through a combination of additional contributions and savings, the Commission proposes the multi-annual financial framework of &euro;1,279 billion in commitments over the period, which is equivalent to 1.114% of the EU 27 gross national income.  This is pretty much comparable with the size of the current financial framework, when taken in real terms, and includes the European Development Fund, which gives support to developing countries that up to now have been outside the budget.<\/p><p> If we go back to the multi-annual frameworks from the late 1980s, one can see that the bulk of spending was on the traditional policy of the Common Agricultural Policy and that, little by little, cohesion funding grew in size and share of the budget.  The current proposal streamlines CAP and cohesion funding, and while these remain very important policies which bring great added value and benefits to member states, it also takes account of new priorities which need reinforcement, such as research and innovation, youth and migration, to name just a few.<\/p><p> Of course, we are talking about an EU of 27 and we all realise and accept there is a gap.  The United Kingdom's departure will lead to a gap of some &euro;84 billion across the seven years, although this should be partly matched by new resources and partly by savings and redeployments from existing programmes.<\/p><p> There are key increases in priority areas, such as research, migration and youth, and also an increased emphasis on climate change and climate mainstreaming.  The current multi-annual financial perspective dedicated 20% of expenditure to this and it will go up to 25%.<\/p><p> There are many innovations and new programmes within the proposals.  The Commission made its overall communication on 2 May but all the proposals for all the programmes will be on the table by the end of this week and the final package is to be adopted on 14 June.  While there simply is not time for me to run through all of them with the committee, I would like to focus on a couple of particular innovations.  Digital Europe, which is not only about investment in the digital sector but also about upskilling European citizens in regard to the digital economy, is proposed to have a budget over the period of &euro;9.2 billion.  Invest EU will build on the success of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, or the Juncker plan.  With a budget of &euro;15.2 billion, it can mobilise more than &euro;650 billion of additional investment across Europe and will provide advisory services and accompanying measures to support projects.  With respect to the euro and EMU, it is important to strengthen the economic and monetary union, and the tools to do this must not be separate but part and parcel of the overall financial architecture of the Union.<\/p><p> Two new instruments are proposed - a reform support programme and a European investment stabilisation function.  The reform support programme will have an overall budget of &euro;25 billion and include a reform delivery tool to provide financial support across all member states for key reforms identified in the context of the European semester.  A convergence facility will provide dedicated support for member states seeking to adopt the euro.  Tailor-made technical support is given to member states on request for the design and implementation of reforms.  It will build on the experience of the structural reform support service which has provided support for more than 440 projects in 24 member states in recent years.<\/p><p> There will be a new CAP delivery model, bringing operations together under a single programming instrument, the CAP strategic plan which each member state will deliver.  It is proposed to have more flexibility and simplification.  Direct payments will remain an essential part of the CAP but will be moderately reduced and better targeted, with a more balanced distribution of payments to be promoted through compulsory capping at farm level, with a view to redistributing towards small and medium-sized farms.  The CAP will also have reinforced links with environmental objectives.  It is proposed that there be a new crisis reserve to address crises generated by unforeseeable developments in international markets or by specific shocks to the agriculture sector.  The innovation side, particularly in terms of agrifood, rural development and the bioeconomy, will benefit from an earmarked &euro;10 billion within the Horizon Europe research programme.<\/p><p> In addition to trying to improve, streamline and innovate in our spending policies, the Commission would like to review the financing of the budget in line with the recommendations of the high level group on the future financing of the European Union, chaired by Mr. Mario Monti.  The departure of the United Kingdom means that there will be no more UK rebates.  Similarly, the rebates for certain member states will be phased out in order that there will be a level playing field.  They will be phased out gradually over five years so as not to create a dramatic shock for those member states that have been benefiting from them.<\/p><p> Other changes include the fact that the collection costs retained by member states from traditional own resources of customs duties and so on will be returned to a figure of 10% from 20%.  This will have an impact on some member states more than others, notably Belgium and the Netherlands which collect most of the customs duties.  The VAT-based own resource will be simplified.<\/p><p> The Commission is proposing to find 12% on the revenue side of the budget through new own resources, which will allow for a reduction in traditional own resources, particularly the GNI contributions of member states.  We will try to focus them on areas that align with policy.  For example, a tax on non-recyclable plastics could provide part of the revenue.  This is clearly linked with environmental policy.  It would have the added benefit of encouraging member states to reduce their plastic waste and would, by bringing revenue to the budget, reduce their GNI contributions.  If the necessary legislation was adopted, the relaunched common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, would link the financing of the EU budget directly with the benefits enjoyed by companies operating in the Single Market.  The Commission proposes to allocate a 20% share of the emissions trading system, ETS, revenues to the EU budget.<\/p><p> These new elements could, on average, contribute &euro;22 billion per year, which would correspond to approximately 12% of EU budget revenue.  The proposed reforms are about changing the way the budget is funded, not its overall size.  The Commission would like to proceed with the next steps as quickly as possible, with a view to arriving at an agreement before the European Parliament elections in 2019.<\/p><p>The intention, and it is one of the reasons the legislative proposals have been put on the table so quickly after the overall communication, is to ensure the new programmes can get off the ground as quickly as possible in 2021.  We have learned from the experience of the 2014-2020 financial framework, where agreement came late in 2013, that the first year was effectively lost in terms of implementation, which is very negative for the overall policies and for the individual beneficiaries.<\/p><p> I stress the importance of EU added value in the new proposal and the aim of the Commission to modernise and focus policies to build a prosperous secure and cohesive Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer Brown","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Brown for that overview.

It is a significant area of responsibility.  It is a huge document, which is very difficult to go through in any amount of detail in the space of a meeting.  I agree there is a time for changing budgetary strategy.  This is the time for the change, which had to come.  I am a bit concerned about the reduction in the CAP because that affects this country more than most others.  Car manufacturing and engineering is to Germany, Italy and a number of other countries what agriculture is to Ireland.  Agriculture is our gold standard; it is what helped us recover when financial institutions all over Europe went down a few years ago.  The agricultural sector recovered because it is self sufficient.  It sources 90% of all its inputs at home, with a few exceptions, and for that reason it is important.  I know from the indications already that there will be trimming of the Common Agricultural Policy at the higher levels and this is to introduce a greater degree of fairness.  Generally speaking, that will be acceptable.  The danger is it might set in train a theme that we might be able to survive without agriculture.  We would not survive without agriculture.  We must ensure agriculture throughout Europe is supported for a variety of reasons, including the environmental reasons, which we all know about; the economic reasons, which we all know about; and the need to have a major food producing sector in the community of approximately 500 million people.  Any deviation from that will cause problems.<\/p> <p>  I know that in modern marketing everybody will say that one can source food elsewhere.  That is the policy in the United Kingdom.  It always had a cheap food policy, sourcing food anywhere.  That is probably one of the reason that it wishes to move away from the European Union.  I think it has made a mistake but we will have to live with it.<\/p> <p>  The next position is moving towards innovation and technology.  We need to recognise in a positive way the potential for smaller countries, in particular, of innovation and technology by offering the supports that are necessary.  There is no reason in the world that the European Union cannot have the most sophisticated educational and innovative systems in terms of the use of modern methods and technology to source and boost industry and to boost production.  There is no reason  we cannot continue in that direction into the future.<\/p> <p>  Ms Brown mentioned research which is one of the key areas we should explore and exploit to the best of our ability.  We should not to be ashamed of it.<\/p><p>Over recent years, when many people were sceptical about our ability to survive in certain circumstances, we showed in our own modest way in our own economy that we have a major contribution to make.  We proved that we were well able to survive by relying on our educational system, on research and on innovation, in conjunction with agriculture.<\/p><p> I am concerned that more emphasis is not being placed on the implications of the post-Brexit situation for a number of countries.  I believe the island of Ireland, in particular, will suffer greatly as a result of Brexit.  That does not mean we will become impoverished overnight or something like that.  It means our potential may be curtailed to some extent.  It will take us some time to catch up again.  I am referring to this part of the island and to Northern Ireland.  As we move towards the actual departure of the UK from the EU and its implications, I wonder whether it might be wise to place a greater emphasis on the supports that might be required in Border areas and in Northern Ireland as a result of what is now taking place.  It may be the case that we will be able to see this much more clearly a year or two from now.  Much will depend on what happens between now and 2021.  If it does not work out right from our point of view, we will have a lot to lose.  The EU has a great deal to lose as well.  I would like to see a greater recognition of the potential danger in this area.  Some provision should be made to cater for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#F00300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Brown for her comprehensive explanation of the EU budget.  Deputy Durkan mentioned the CAP, which I understand is facing a 5% reduction.  Ireland is always going to have concerns about anything to do with the CAP.  As CAP payments comprise approximately 75% of total farm incomes in Ireland, any reduction in subsidies will have a serious detrimental impact on thousands of farmers and their families.  Obviously, reform is always welcome and necessary, but we would be concerned about the direct impact on the incomes of farm families in this country.<\/p> <p>  This budget is being framed in the context of the Brexit process, which is under way.  The Taoiseach has said that Ireland would be happy to increase its contribution to the EU.  It has suggested that this increase might be as much as &euro;3 billion.

I would like to highlight a couple of aspects of this issue.  It is absolutely vital for member states to realise that funding will have to be increased.  The Irish Government has been clear on this issue and has led on it.  If we want to pursue the 80:20 proposal, the agreement of all member states will be needed.  It is really a question of priorities thereafter.<\/p><p>Most member states are willing to accept that the curtailment of certain existing policies is necessary.  In terms of funding, questions arise around security, migration and youth employment.  There is one area in which I have a real reservation.  I believe the single biggest threat to the Union, notwithstanding the daily headlines on extremism and so on, is youth unemployment and the manner in which the European Union will deal with the next generations who have no memory of war or the concept underpinning the foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community which subsequently became the European Economic Community and European Union.  The balance is still wrong and while the increase in funding for this area is to be welcomed, I would prefer a much greater emphasis on this issue.<\/p><p> As the negotiations proceed, we need to define what we mean by the funding of migration, the structures the EU wants to put in place and security in that context.  While certain measures fully fit and are in harmony with our interests, in other areas Ireland will need to seek an agreement with the Commission to ensure neutral member states such as Ireland do not have a problem with certain aspects of EU funding.  Perhaps Ms Brown will address this balance between some of the newer priority areas and the reason we are not seeing an even greater increase in funding to tackle youth unemployment, which could fundamentally undermine support for the EU across a host of member states over the period of the framework for this budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#G00400","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Brown for attending this Oireachtas meeting and for being informative.  In the part of Ireland I represent, small farmers and part-time farmers must be protected.  There would be no life to be had in very rural regions if farmers were not compensated or given funding.  They have depended on the funding they have received over the years from the EU.  I certainly hope their support will not be cut in any way.  They cannot afford their income to be reduced any further.  We must remember that these payments from the EU are compensation, not a gift.  It is compensation for not being paid properly for their produce in the first place.  Ms Brown spoke of more flexibility for medium and smaller farmers.  Will she delve into that a little bit further or explain how it will happen?  We cannot cut the support for these people.  There is no room for cuts there.<\/p> <p>  Many suckler herd farmers will leave the sector the next few years.  If we do not have the calf, then we do not have the heifer or the bullock down the road.  Traditionally the farmers in Kerry, west Cork, Mayo and Clare supply the weanlings.  They produce very good animals and they are very good at it, but they are not being paid or rewarded.  Some of these farmers are barely existing.  Costs have risen and the price of the beef has not increased.  At Castleisland mart back in 1984 or 1985 weanlings made &pound;720.  The very same type of weanling in recent times has only made &euro;750.  We all know that costs have risen since that time.  We see what is happening daily with rising fuel costs, which affect every farmer.<\/p><p> The other thing we worry about is food and beef coming in from countries where standards are not as high and where it is produced more cheaply because it is not produced to the standards our farmers produce it to.  I firmly believe Irish farmers cannot survive without financial assistance from Europe but in tandem with that I believe Europe needs Irish farmers.  They provide a safe and well produced product to a high standard.<\/p><p> The other worry I have is Leader funding.  I do not know if the witnesses are aware of the changes that have occurred in the way the Leader funding has been administered, or is not administered, in certain areas.  For 25 years, there was a bottom up approach and the development companies, which were not politically aligned, dealt very fairly with rural areas and provided the necessary funding and assistance that was needed to keep rural communities in existence.  I am worried about the way it has been aligned with local authorities.  Local authorities do their business very well but I am worried that they will cater more for the centres with greater populations.  I would like it if the witnesses would address that concern because the way we administered the Leader funding over the years was highly regarded and I wonder what Europe thinks of the changes that have taken place where the funding is administered through the local authorities.  Are the witnesses concerned about that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#H00200","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael Collins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#J00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Brown for her presentation.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has spoken about a lot of the issues that would be of serious concern to the people I represent.  I would go back to the programme for Government negotiations about two and a half years ago.  I remember being at the table with the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, who I always said was the best negotiator of the whole lot who were there, but we did not agree on the single farm payment that was being distributed to farmers in Ireland where some farmers were getting &euro;150,000 but with more only getting &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000.  It got so heated one night, and we had a lot of late nights, that we both had our hands, or maybe fists, on the table, fighting our own corner.  I was always of the belief that no farmer should get more than &euro;50,000.  He was totally against that at that time but that is the road that has been travelled.  I hope it continues that way and that the money that will be saved will be distributed to the smaller farmer and not percentage wise, because it sounds good on the basis of percentages, but some poor fellow might end up only moving from &euro;2,500 to &euro;2,800.  We have to protect the farm families which do not feel protected by the EU at the moment.  They are totally dependent on payments for survival.  This is an ideal opportunity to set that straight.  For many years, the situation faced by those families has been extremely unfair and it has put a lot of them out of business.<\/p> <p>  We have to look at part-time farmer as well because most of the part-time farmers I know would love to work on the farm all day but they cannot afford to do that.  They are forced out to work.  They are working late nights and early mornings on the farm and then they go out to work for part, or most, of the day.  They have to be protected and we have to reduce the high level of payments to a normal level and try to help as many as possible to survive going forward.<\/p><p>In the past seven or eight months there was little or no compensation for a lot of farmers in dire circumstances where animals were literally dying because of the lack of fodder.  There is a need to have available an emergency fund that can be accessed more easily in extreme circumstances.  We should also try to get young farmers off the ground and started.   A lot of them do not see a future in agriculture and the CAP negotiations are a time to set the record straight.<\/p><p> One other issue is food safety.  We must ensure all food being imported into the European Union has the same level of traceability.  The Mercosur deal is an extreme worry for Irish agriculture, but it should also be an extreme worry for many other EU countries because traceability is a big issue that needs to be focused on in the future.<\/p><p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae mentioned Leader programme funding.  There is no doubt that rural communities benefited tremendously from it under previous programme and the funding was distributed fairly as best as possible.  Sadly, changes were made that were detrimental for rural communities.  A lot of new rules and regulations have been put in place that have made it extremely difficult for ordinary voluntary groups to access draw down funds.  The programme will end at the end of next year, but it is only now that the money is starting to drift towards communities.  Unfortunately, it is out of the hands of the voluntary sector and in those of the political system.  It is like a slush fund for Deputies and councillors who are notified before anybody else.  They all run out to give the good news to the community, saying they have obtained &euro;100,000 for their constituents, but that is not what Leader funding was meant for.  The system was changed and included in the political realm.  That was the biggest mistake ever made and the European Union should have stepped in.  Alarm bells were ringing that it was the wrong way to travel, but the European Union still allowed it to happen.  We often hear in this country that there are certain things we cannot do because of the European Union, that it is instructing us not to do the.  It was certainly instructing those involved not to do this, but they still went ahead and did it.  They can certainly do things if they want to.  I do not agree with the system now in place.  As I said it is completely political.  It should not have gone political and I urge the delegates to tell the powers that be that this is the case and that we need to address the issue, as well as easing access to funds and cutting back on red tape.  Funding from the European Union under the Leader programme is the life and soul of communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#J00300","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.  I had to attend another meeting downtown.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the delegates for the presentation, but I have a cynic's view.  I have been hearing about the simplification of European Union rules for 20 years and will hear it for the next 20, but it never happens.  I will not say anything further.  <\/p> <p>  The delegates are probably familiar with the saying, \"whistling past the graveyard\".  It means putting the best face on a bad situation.  I was fascinated by the line that \"the new budget is an opportunity to shape our future as a new ambitious Union of 27 bound together by solidarity.  With today's proposal we put forward a pragmatic plan for how to do more with less.\"  I cannot think of too many ways to do much more with much less.  We have to make sure those who benefit from the schemes we think are beneficial receive the exact same money and more.  That is why I am going to ask a few pertinent questions.  <\/p> <p>  Down the road we will get to the details of how the money will be spent.  As I understand it, at this stage the focus is on how much money will be spent and the big frameworks under which it will be spent.  We will then have all of the figures for how much will be spent in the various sectors, including agriculture.<\/p><p> Ms Brown referred to \"own resources\", including a 3% call rate applied to the new common consolidated corporate tax base.  What effect will that have on our corporate tax rate if it is introduced?  Second, how much is it expected will be collected from non-recycled plastic packaging waste?  My suspicion is that, with the ingenuity of industry, the minute this is introduced, it will disappear.  It is a bit like when we introduced emissions taxation on cars and we lost a lot of tax as a result because the companies moved away from high emissions to low emissions - some honestly and others a little dishonestly, but they did it.  As Ms Brown knows, tax collected on cars post-2008 is much lower than it was pre-2008, even if they are the same engine size.  How much does Ms Brown believe will be collected from that?<\/p><p> I want to ask about the bigger financial scene.  I hear people in this country proposing that Ireland and other countries would increase their contributions to the EU so we would get more money for CAP.  It seems an inefficient way of using our money.  It is a bit like producing electricity in the west of Ireland, bringing it over to London and then bringing it all back, even though there are line losses that occur in pure transmission.  At the moment we are net contributors to the EU and we pay in more than we get out.  For every &euro;1 we pay in, we get something like 90 cent back, and if we pay in &euro;1 billion, we only get &euro;900 million back, if the same rules apply, so there is the first 10% loss.  However, for every &euro;100 million extra we put in, how much will go to agriculture and how much will go, for example, to defence?  Some of us have moral objections to this promotion of the arms industry, which is not really about defence and is more about attack.  What percentage of that &euro;100 million would go to agriculture, which is where we want the money spent, and not to funding massive armies, which is a concern for some of us who do not see that this is the way to bring peace to the world?<\/p><p> If I am right that we would be lucky to get &euro;50 million per &euro;100 million back for agriculture, would it not be better for us to have a higher level of co-funding because there is really no limit in that area?  When I was a Minister, only 25% of European money had to be put in and one could put in as much as 75% of one's own money, and there was effectively no limit to how much of one's own money was put in.  My question is whether it would be more efficient for us, if we want to put in another &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million to make up the shortfall, to put it straight into the Exchequer.  This is particularly the case for Leader because, if it was put straight into Leader funding, we could run Leader continuously and, rather than having this seven-year cycle where we run it for four years, stop for three years and then start again, we could run it for seven years after seven.  In money transmission terms, would it not be better to hold onto the money here and use it to have a higher co-funding ratio, rather than giving it over to Brussels and only getting a very small percentage of it back?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#K00200","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Brown to give an overview of the comments that have been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#L00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528801200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank members for the questions and I hope I will manage to address all of their remarks.<\/p><p> There are a couple of overarching issues which are important to recall.  One is that there is a pot.  How big it is will ultimately be decided in the negotiations with the member states.  It is clear that with the departure of the United Kingdom there will be a gap compared to what we currently fund.  Some of that must be filled by making savings and some will be filled by finding additional contributions.  The overarching result of that will be subject to the negotiations with member state governments. <\/p><p> With respect to youth employment and other policies, I did not touch on this specifically in my initial remarks but it is a very important part of the Commission's proposal.  It is proposed to increase the funding for youth employment by 2.2 times its current total.  The youth employment initiative is now integrated into the European Social Fund+ or ESF+, but youth is a very important part of that.  There is also an increase for ERASMUS, which is a very significant programme for young people.  Investing in people is to the forefront of the ESF+.<\/p><p> On whether some of the programmes will continue, crucially for Ireland the PEACE II programme will continue under the current management system because its importance is very clear.  Leader will also continue.<\/p><p> With respect to the structure of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, the idea is to allow for increased national co-financing.  At face value, EU involvement in CAP will be reduced by 5% because, as I said, there will be one less contributor to the pot.  The ultimate overall level of the budget to be agreed by the member states will be affected.  Within that, there is a need to ensure that the lowest incomes are supported because it is clear that farm incomes lag behind those in the rest of the economy.  The rural community plays a vital role in ensuring not only the continuation of rural communities, but the protection of our environment.  The basic elements of the CAP, as a policy that works, will not change.  Elements such as basic income support for sustainability, redistribution of income support and support for young farmers will stay.  What will change is the delivery mechanism, with more subsidiarity for member states to create strategic plans.  There will be more flexibility between the two pillars of the CAP, that is, direct payments and rural development.  Member states will also be able to see how they would like to structure the process, which is not currently possible.<\/p><p> With respect to the consequences of Brexit, we are still in the negotiation phase and until we know the final outcome it will be difficult to make pronouncements.  A number of mechanisms are built into this proposal, some of which already exist, and we will try to build on them.  These will be available to help any member state suffering economic challenges.  They include the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which has increased to &euro;600 million a year, and InvestEU and the guarantee of loans possible through that.<\/p><p> Food safety remains a very important issue and is now included in the security heading of the budget.  On the revenue side, it is important to remember that the Commission proposal concerning the corporate tax base is still under discussion.<\/p><p>It is something that is ultimately decided by unanimity among the member states.  First, it must remembered that it is not the rate that is proposed to be harmonised but the base, which would first have to be decided by unanimity.  Any legislation related to own resources and the financing of the EU budget is also decided by unanimity.  I believe there are a couple of steps that we have to take before this would become part of the financing.  Nevertheless and as is the case with the plastics proposal, we try to align our proposals for financing with policies.  The best success of the plastics proposal would be that there would be nothing collected because there would be no more plastic waste.  What we are trying to do is to align the revenue side of the budget with the expenditure side and protection of the environment is a very clear priority.  The difficulty is how to increase the funding for priorities, while maintaining the important policies of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the policy cohesion which are so important to many member states and have played such a vital role.  Again we return to what is our ceiling and what can we do within it and whether can we do more with less, which is a challenge.  On the one hand, we have growing priorities, including research, youth, climate change and migration, as well as the traditional priorities.  We have to try to match what can be done within the overall availability.  <\/p><p> I hope I have addressed everything, but, please, remind me if I have not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jennifer Brown","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I would like to come back in on one matter, on which I did not touch in my earlier contribution, in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy.  My major reservation - I disagree with Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; C&uacute;iv, for whom I have great respect - is the notion that the European Commission is pushing allowing this to devolve to member states and increasing flexibility, as outlined in the reply of Ms Brown and also specifically in relation to the top-up which would be a charter for the dismantling of the Common Agricultural Policy in the long term.  What one is effectively saying is that we will opt out and have a minimum payment and that member states can do it.  The obvious implication is that wealthier member states will be able to progressively support their farmers and on a far better level than poorer member states.  Eventually in the round after this, perhaps in five years' time, somebody will say the last time we cut the figure by 5% and the member states that were able to afford it topped it up by 10%.  Therefore, we will do it again.  What we will end up with after a series of two or three EU budgets is a situation where the concept of equality and having a level playing field under the Common Agricultural Policy, under which European farmers are supported on an equal basis to drive up incomes, will effectively be undermined.  What we will then have is disparity where farmers in wealthier member states will become much wealthier and farmers in poorer member states will become poorer.  That is a real risk.  Therefore, I caution against any move by the European Commission or member states to go down that route.  If we do go down that route, we will need to be very up-front and say the CAP, as it stands, will not play a part in the future of the European Union, that it will be a member state top-up, with a cap as an anchor point but not at the heart of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#N00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":340,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, since 2010, when inflation is taken into account, we have seen a massive decrease in European funding under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and all the indications are that this will continue.

There has progressively been an effort to push the money eastwards on the basis of equality which I can understand under the CAP.<\/p><p>We are in the wealthy league because we are net contributors.  If we could put the money in and ring-fence it with a cap for Ireland, that would be handy dandy, as it were, but we cannot, and that is the problem for us.<\/p><p> Ms Brown did not really answer the question.  For every billion euro increase in the budget what percentage goes into the CAP?  I have been trying to get information on how much money we have got since 2010 for infrastructure.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport could not give me the figure.  The Minister wrote to every agency to try to get the figure.  I was a bit surprised but that is the way he works.  The figures that came back were quite trivial compared with the expenditure on motorways and railway lines in that period.  That tailed off over time.  Our main source of finance from Europe is the CAP.  Will the witness tell us per billion euro put in what percentage comes back out in the CAP?  That has to be a factor.  If farmers are given a choice between &euro;100 million out of &euro;100 million or &euro;50 million out of &euro;100 million, and I know farmers in the west can count, they will certainly go for the &euro;100 million out of &euro;100 million.  Maybe farmers up the country are different.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#N00300","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I support my colleague, Deputy Brophy, on the renationalisation of supports for agriculture.  That would be a disaster for this country and for all other small countries throughout the European Union.  The purpose of the CAP was to level off, provide food for a growing population in Europe, and provide continuity of supply at a high standard.  That has worked very well.  To go off on a tangent and decide that each country should support itself would be an appalling short-term policy disaster.  As time goes on, if we mention that often enough, someone will take us up and tell us that if we want that kind of thing, we will get it.  We should be very careful about that.<\/p><p>This country has benefited greatly from membership of the European Union under virtually every pillar.  Successive Governments have used the money well.  There will always be people who say it should have been done better or there should have been more emphasis on something else.  That is the way it always was and will be.  Speaking from memory, our gross domestic product, GDP, in 1988 was way below the average in the European Union, which in turn was way below that of the United States.  The European Free Trade Association, EFTA, countries at that time were well ahead of us with an income <i>per capita<\/i>three times that of ours.  There has been a transformation in this country in the meantime.  We do not notice things that are going well and we do not seem to emphasise them.  They did well, however, and the country did well as a result with the support we got from the European Union, albeit in return for payments into the European funds.  We got more back.  That is the purpose of the European Union, to bring the level of development within the Union up to a certain standard so that the Union became more efficient, more self-sufficient and fairer.  It has done that.<\/p><p>Sometimes I hear versions of the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, as being of benefit to Ireland and so on.  Everything is of benefit provided everybody does it and recognises what happens.  It is like the financial transaction tax, the Tobin tax.  Everybody in this country will say it is a great idea and that we should get a fair chunk of tax from all those wealthy transactions.<\/p><p>It is of no benefit to us, however, unless everybody across the globe does it, for the simple reason that those who will gain most from it will gain more than they ever did before by virtue of scale.  We need to be very cautious about how far we go down the road and that we do not find ourselves collecting taxes, for instance, on profits made by multinational corporations in other European member states and non-member states.  That is one of the things looming ahead of us.  There is a court case pending in respect of Apple at present.  We have to look after our own business to the best of our ability.  That means we need to be treated fairly and we need to recognise that everybody is entitled to be treated fairly as well.  To go off on a tangent with some idea that we are alone in this is not useful.<\/p><p> There is a growing notion across some European countries that going back to the old ways and days might be better than what we have experienced over the past years.  That is a load of rubbish and anybody who has learned about European history, as I am sure everybody here has, will know that over 1,000 years, the biggest single peace initiative ever on the globe was the European Union.  I think we take it for granted.  It has little hiccups from time to time but it is still without any shadow of doubt the biggest single barrier to war.  It is not many years back that 60 million people died in the last major conflict.  The European Union has done a lot.  Its focus has moved away from that but we do need to be careful that we do not start improving the roundness of the wheel.  There are always a few people around who think they can do that.  It started off as a rough multi-angular shape and then it became a round wheel.  Several people since then have tried to make the wheel more perfect in its roundness but it does not happen that way and will never work.  We need to recognise that we are all in the European Union for a purpose, namely, to bring ourselves along together, support each other and recognise that together we go forward and united we stand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#O00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>With those words of wisdom, I invite Ms Brown to have the final say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018061200002#P00200","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528801200,"counter":345,"content":"<p>To provide a couple of clarifications, there is no national top-up on direct aid.

We all recognise how we have benefitted from the European Union and it is important to use that experience to help shape the debate on the future of Europe and on what our priorities should be.  The post-2020 multi-annual financial framework, MFF, comes at a time of change and adjustment for the EU.  Longer-term challenges such as economic competitiveness, youth unemployment and climate change, emerging challenges to international trade and access to the Single Market, as well as international challenges, such as migration, security and terrorism have become more pronounced.  In addition, the departure of the UK will cause both short and long-term practical challenges for the MFF.  <\/p> <p>  It is worth recalling how Ireland's relationship with the EU budget has evolved.  As the committee will be aware, Ireland has traditionally been a significant net beneficiary of the EU budget.  From accession in 1973 to 2016, we paid in approximately &euro;34 billion but received &euro;76 billion, &euro;42 billion more than we contributed. <\/p> <p>  On foot of our growing prosperity, however, we have moved from being a net beneficiary to a net contributor.  Member state contributions to the EU budget are calculated by the EU Commission in line with the provisions outlined in the own resource decision, which was ratified by all member states in 2016.  There are three sources of EU revenue or own resources, namely, customs duties, contributions based on VAT and contributions based on gross national income, GNI.  When taken together, the traditional own resources and VAT elements account for approximately 30% of member state contributions.  The remainder comes from GNI.  This is an important element, as it links the contributions of member states to the size of their economies. <\/p> <p>  Given the high levels of economic growth in Ireland in recent years, combined with a lack of such growth among other member states until recently, our overall share of contributions to the EU budget has grown and Ireland became a net contributor to the EU budget &ndash; on a cashflow basis - for the first time in 2014.<\/p><p>Ireland's current contribution as set out in the stability programme update and is forecast to be approximately &euro;2.7 billion in 2018 moving towards &euro;2.9 billion in 2019.  It is worth noting that while these forecasts are volatile and contingent on a number of variables, the trend in Ireland's growing contributions is continuing.<br\/><br\/>Under the current MFF, it is forecast that Ireland will receive just over &euro;12 billion over the course of the seven years, of which 80% comes through the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and is spent on areas such as direct income and market support to the agricultural sector.  Further moneys are received for rural development programmes.  There is broad awareness in both urban and rural areas of Ireland of the role which these funds play.  While Ireland has benefited enormously from structural and cohesion funding, which continues to play an important role for many other member states in fostering economic development and prosperity, receipts in this area have been declining in recent years because of our economic growth.  I welcome especially the Commission's proposal for a new PEACE PLUS programme to continue and build on previous PEACE and INTERREG programmes.  The Government has been consistent about its commitment to the implementation of the current programmes and to successor programmes beyond 2020.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has also benefited from, and is supportive of, programmes for competitiveness for growth and jobs, including Horizon 2020, Connecting Europe Facility, and Erasmus+.  For example, the Horizon 2020 programme to support research and development is an important driver of research excellence, and Ireland is on track to achieve &euro;1.2 billion in competitive funding under the current MFF in this area.  Ireland welcomes the European Commission's publication of proposals on the post-2020 MFF programme.  While many parts of the proposal have been published, a number of others have yet to be released.  A key point in the proposal is &euro;1.135 trillion in commitments in 2018 prices, or &euro;1.279.4 trillion in current prices, covering the period 2021 to 2027.  This is equivalent to 1.11% of the EU 27's gross national income.  Further key points in the proposal include more funding for priority areas, including research and innovation, young people, the digital economy, border management, security and defence, CAP, Cohesion Policy funding to be reduced by approximately 5%, and Erasmus+ to be doubled.<br\/><br\/>The Commission has made a number of proposals on own resources, including an increase in the own-resources ceiling from 1.2% to 1.29%; a reduction from 20% to 10% in the amount member states can retain when collecting customs revenues; a more simplified approach for calculating VAT payments to the EU; the retention of gross national income, GNI, and the elimination of rebates.<b><\/b>In addition, the Commission proposes a number of measures to increase own resources, including, for example, 20% of the revenues from the emissions trading system; 3% of the proposed common consolidated corporate tax base, and a national contribution calculated on the amount of non-recycled plastic packaging waste in each member state, set at 80 cent per kilo.<br\/><br\/>The Government has begun to develop a national position on these matters.  We believe that the MFF post 2020 should continue to adapt to evolving priorities.  We also believe that we should not lose sight of the value and contribution of traditional policies, including agriculture and cohesion.  CAP is a key national interest and will continue to be so.  We want the EU to continue to fund programmes that work and work well.  Expenditure in the area of agriculture helps to support 44 million jobs across the EU while contributing to food security and safety, rural sustainability and environmental standards.  Cohesion is another important policy tool of the Union.  Structural Funds for less developed member states of the Union will enable them to unlock their economic potential, which will benefit all of us in the long run.  We will need to consider carefully the implications of any amendments in these areas.  We welcome the emphasis on other policies that function well, including Erasmus+, the framework programme for research and innovation and the EU's global instruments.  It is vital also that there be a continuation of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes post Brexit as foreseen in the Commission's progress report from last December.<br\/><br\/>Ireland believes that the amount of expenditure at EU level will need to be proportionate and appropriate to the overall levels of available funding and that the discussions on the post-2020 MFF priorities and objectives will need to be framed in this context.  That accepted, the Taoiseach has indicated that Ireland is open to contributing more provided that it meets European added value objectives.  As the committee will appreciate, the Commission's proposals are complex and will require careful analysis and study.  They are underpinned by legislative proposals in each of the sectoral areas.  All relevant Departments are examining these carefully and will prepare to engage in the detailed discussions which will begin at official level.  We will engage in a positive and constructive way.<br\/><br\/>As members will be aware of what the country-specific process entails, I will skip to comments on the recommendations.  Similar to last year, Ireland received three recommendations in the areas of fiscal policy, Government expenditure and investment, and the management of long-term non-performing loans, respectively.  CSR 1 deals with the effectiveness of public finances and expenditure.  In particular, it focuses on the reduction of Government debt and broadening the tax base, as it did last year.  Our stronger than expected headline growth in 2017 has allowed us to make good progress towards achieving our medium-term objective and reducing Government debt, which has also benefited from the use of windfall gains from the sale of part of AIB.<br\/><br\/>CSR 2 addresses the implementation of the national development plan.  This recommendation reflects the Government's investment priorities and dovetails with our stated priorities, including child care, housing and water services.  For the first time, CSR 3 focuses on productivity growth, with particular regard for small and medium enterprises.  This is welcome as the Department has collaborated with the OECD on firm level productivity research, which was published in March and on which a presentation was given at the March ECOFIN.  CSR 3 also emphasises resolution of long-term loan arrears, building on initiatives for vulnerable households.<br\/><br\/>These recommendations have been examined by my Department and are not surprising given the emphasis placed on these areas in the country report.  Such recommendations are to be expected for a growing economy and I agree with their overall substance.  The country specific recommendations will be on the agenda for discussion and agreement at the ECOFIN Council on 22 June and, following that, they are expected to be endorsed by the European Council at the end of June.  They will finally be adopted at ECOFIN on 13 July.  Member states will then be able to reflect them in their budgetary and policy plans for 2019.<br\/><br\/>I turn now to the issue of banking union.  As members will know, in response to the financial crisis, a number of initiatives were introduced at EU level to create a safer financial sector.  These initiatives form a single rule book for all financial actors in the EU member states and consist of a set of legislative texts that are applied to all financial institutions across the EU.  Specifically, the rules include capital requirements for banks, rules for managing failing banks and improved deposit guarantee schemes.  The most significant elements are the capital requirements regulation, the bank recovery and resolution directive and the deposit guarantee schemes.  The Commission has also proposed a European deposit insurance scheme, or EDIS.  In addition to this single rule book, which is the foundation of banking union, there was a commitment to shift supervision to the European level with the introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism at the end of November 2014 and later with the establishment of the Single Resolution Mechanism.  A roadmap for the creation of banking union set out the main steps to be undertaken.  The three pillars to be set up comprise the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the Single Resolution Mechanism and EDIS, the European deposit insurance scheme.<br\/><br\/>At the ECOFIN meeting in May, Ministers agreed the latest measures in banking union, known as the risk reduction measures.  These measures were proposed by the European Commission in November and are aimed at implementing reforms agreed at international level.  The package comprised two regulations and two directives and is aimed at updating and amending the capital requirements regulation, the capital requirements directive and the bank recovery and resolution directive, which are the aspects of the single rule book which underpin the first two pillars of banking union.  These proposals are simply aimed to ensure that banks have sufficient loss absorption and recapitalisation capacity in the case of a bank resolution.<\/p><p>The aim is to enable banks to continue critical functions without endangering financial stability or requiring taxpayer support.  One of the key amendments introduced at EU level was the total loss absorbing capacity standard, which had been agreed at international level for global systemically important banks.  The total loss absorbing capacity standard was integrated into EU law as part of the package that was agreed in May.  The amendments to the capital requirements regulation and the capital requirements directive introduced stronger prudential requirements for banks to ensure they are adequately capitalised and less susceptible to liquidity issues.  For the most part, these amendments aim to implement additional international standards that have been agreed since the implementation in 2013 of the original capital requirements regulation and the capital requirements directive.  They also include measures which aim to reduce the regulatory burden on smaller and less complex banks.  I believe that the package agreed at ECOFIN is a good one.  I hope the European Parliament will be able to start negotiations shortly, thereby allowing us to agree these proposals and enact them as soon as possible.<\/p><p> The final item the joint committee has asked me to address is the proposed EU directive on the protection of whistleblowers.  As members may be aware, Ireland is one of just ten EU member states to have enacted a comprehensive package of protections for whistleblowers.  We did this when we introduced the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  While I welcome the EU initiative in this area, careful consideration of how the EU proposals will interact with the operation of the 2014 Act is needed.  I do not want the protections offered by our legislation to be diluted.  I am pleased that the approach taken by the EU mirrors many of the provisions of our legislation.  For example, it applies to broad categories of workers.  The protections from retaliation provided for in the draft directive are broadly similar to those provided for in our legislation.  They include protection from dismissal and other forms of detriment such as reduction in pay, suspension, demotion or withholding of promotion.<\/p><p> There are a number of important differences between the proposed directive and the 2014 Act.  The directive applies to a wider cohort of persons and a wider range of matters.  It specifically obliges businesses with more than 50 employees or a turnover of &euro;10 million or more to establish formal channels and procedures for receiving disclosures.  Companies in financial services or other areas at high risk of being vulnerable to money laundering or terrorist financing will be required to establish internal channels irrespective of size.  The practical implications will require careful consideration and clarification.  The transposition of the directive, if it is adopted, may require some amendments to the 2014 Act to reflect the provisions of the directive and ensure harmonisation of the procedures for making a disclosure under the directive and 2014 Act.  As the committee may be aware, a statutory review of the operation of the 2014 Act is being finalised.  The potential impact of the directive will be taken into consideration in the review, which I aim to publish by the deadline of 8 July.  I hope I have given the committee an outline of the various issues it asked me to address.  I will be happy to take any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061200002#D00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528810200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

I appreciate that.  There is some interesting detail in the specific recommendations that are coming forward.  It has been stated that access to affordable full-time quality childcare remains a challenge.  According to the OECD, in 2015, childcare costs in Ireland relative to wages for single parents were the highest in the EU and for couples were the second highest in the EU.  The OECD has also referred to the link between the rate of risk of poverty or social exclusion and the high proportion of people who are living in households with low work intensity.  Under the heading of aggressive tax planning, it is suggested that between 2010 and 2015, some 23% of Irish GDP was made up of royalty payments.  It is staggering that we have a figure of 23%, given that the European average is 0.34%.  It has been suggested that this is a clear indicator that our tax code is being used for aggressive tax planning.  Our figure is completely out of line with the European average.  Given that so much of our GDP over that period was made up of royalty payments, and bearing in mind the challenges that exist - as I have mentioned, child care costs for single parents are the highest in Europe and for couples are the second highest in Europe, and high levels of people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion - does the Minister think the Government has got the balance right in its budgetary measures of recent years?  Is it not the case that our tax code has facilitated aggressive tax planning to the detriment of this country being able to take a leadership role in Europe?  The cost of child care is preventing certain families from entering into the workplace and is creating a scenario in which they are at risk of poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061200002#F00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1528810200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I believe I have got the balance right.  The Deputy made a point about the level of loyalty payments that exist within our national income.  I do not accept that this is a feature of aggressive tax planning.  Instead, it demonstrates that we have a highly open economy which is deeply integrated into global supply chains.  As the Deputy is aware, this country has had an ongoing focus on attracting foreign direct investment.  The Deputy has said that loyalty payments account for a high share of our national income, but the other side of the coin is that the economic policies which have been pursued by me and my predecessor have contributed to the fact that in the coming weeks and months, we expect to have more people at work in this country than we have ever had before.  As a feature of our open economy, we collect approximately &euro;8 billion in corporation tax.  In the coming weeks, I intend to outline the roadmap for ensuring our corporate tax code moves in a way that continues to meet the requirements laid down for us by the OECD.<\/p> <p>  I do not differ from the Deputy on one point.  I am aware of the issue of childcare costs, which absorb a high share of the after-tax income of many citizens of our State, particularly families in which just one partner is working.  I understand the pressure that places on many of our citizens.  For that reason, we began the steady implementation of an affordable childcare scheme in October 2016.  The objective of that scheme is to provide targeted subsidies to families that need support in getting childcare and to ensure that childcare is of the quality that Deputy Doherty and I would want.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061200002#F00500","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1528810200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>We do not disagree with what the Minister has said about our highly open economy.

Alarm bells should be ringing.  It is serious.  This is not just a question of having a highly open economy.  The European average is 0.34%.

I am responsible for tax policy and broad economic policy.  I have explained to the Deputy why that level of loyalty payment is high.

However, our is also an economy that has a higher level of foreign direct investment and intellectual property located in it than many other parts of the EU.  Within the mix of economic policies that I have pursued, I would hope for acknowledgement from the Deputy that this approach has also delivered the level of job creation that he, in our darkest moments, would have thought impossible.

That is an achievement that the Deputy and his party said would not happen, but it will.<\/p> <p>  As to what we will do to address issues of concern with the operation of our tax code, the measures that my predecessor and I implemented to introduce country-by-country reporting and mandatory disclosure of tax planning led to us getting the highest possible transparency rating from the OECD.

He said it would cause reputational damage and reduce the effective tax rate to 1.25%.  Instead, the Minister's predecessor moved from 90%, the figure that was under discussion in the paper in question, to 100% despite that advice.  The Department still will not release the minutes of the four meetings it had with Apple, which was the largest beneficiary of this tax move.  We know that Apple discussed this issue with departmental officials during the passage of the Finance Bill because that has already been acknowledged.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that he would not use the word \"guilty\".  Obviously, he is proud of his record, but it is one that has benefitted multinationals - actually, only a small number of them, as to say otherwise would be unfair to the majority of multinationals - with aggressive tax planning.  It has ensured that their shareholders reap the benefits of money that should be reaped by Irish taxpayers and invested in our economy to deal with our issues.<\/p> <p>  The Minister stated that I would not acknowledge employment levels, but of course I will acknowledge that we have the most people working ever.  We have the largest number of people in the State since the Famine, so that would have been the case in any event, but there have been major advances.  I also recognise that the Minister's policy has resulted in 100,000 workers being at risk of poverty.  Many workers have if-and-when contracts and so on.  If they happened to be working in Donegal, they would have the least disposable income in the State because of the type of policy being advanced.  The Minister might respond to these points.<\/p> <p>  An issue mentioned in the CSRs report relates to the Government's new venture of the so-called rainy day fund, an idea that was first floated by Fianna F&aacute;il during its election campaign in order to shed its image of being financially reckless.  Let us forget that it drove the economy off the cliff and so forth.  Under the policy, the deposit was originally supposed to be &euro;1 billion but is now &euro;500 million, and the policy was only meant to be introduced when we achieved the medium-term objective but it will now happen in advance of that.  According to the CSRs report, it is unclear how the design of the rainy day fund could ensure that it is truly countercyclical.  How will the Minister ensure it is countercyclical?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018061200002#G00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1528810200,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I said that I was responsible for the conduct of tax and economic policy.

It is incumbent on me to point that out while also pointing to the difficulties that we still face.<\/p> <p>  Before addressing the Deputy's question on the operation of the rainy day fund, I should make a final point about the future operation of corporate tax policy.

I expect to see the levels of corporate tax paid increase because of some of the changes in the US tax package.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the question on how I can ensure that moneys allocated within the rainy day fund can only be spent at times of economic difficulty as opposed to when things are going okay, I am aiming to put a triple lock in place in the legislation that is being drafted.

I introduced that measure because it created additional resources to allow us to invest in public capital and infrastructure.  Where the Deputy and I differ is that I believe the existence of a well funded rainy day fund sends out an important signal about our economy which will, in turn, allow us to borrow at sustainably low rates.  In addition, if we get into exceptional difficulty, as we did in the recent past, we have something we can use beyond the normal automatic stabilisers.

It is not just a case of starting to reach the European average or being a leader in terms of expenditure in capital in Europe.  Over the past ten years we have had the lowest level of capital investment in Europe.  When I was at school there was a sign with the seanfhocal, \"N&iacute; h&eacute; l&aacute; na gaoithe l&aacute; na scolb\", which means the day of the storm is not a day for thatching.  What the Minister is doing is trying to put &euro;3 billion away, which is a tiny amount if we have to deal with a major unforeseen event, instead of dealing with the leaks we have at this point in time.  While I do not want to rehearse the point, we have a crisis in housing.  The increase in capital proposed for this year is not ambitious enough to deal with the 10,000 people in emergency accommodation, not to speak of the 100,000 people on the waiting list.  Our universities are slipping down the international rankings.  Look at the presentations being made to the Minister's Department seeking &euro;3 billion in capital investment for physical education.  That is without addressing the need for additional investment in current spending on education.<\/p> <p>  We spoke about the barriers in the area of childcare.  Ireland tops the league for childcare costs for single parents and is placed second for childcare costs for couples.  There are many other challenges.  The Government has normalised the crisis in health.  Every day, 400 people wait on hospital trolleys and the Government does not view it as a crisis.  The fiscal rules were designed to ensure we do not return to the policies of the Fianna F&aacute;il era and the \"if we have it, we will spend it\" attitude.  They curtail the level of spending by member states in any one year.  If the Minister had any sense of patriotism, he would use the resources and flexibility available to us within the fiscal rules to deal with the real human crises we are facing every day.  There are hundreds of thousands of people waiting for operations and hundreds of people on hospital trolleys.  There are 10,000 people homeless.  We have no broadband in rural areas.  We have creaking infrastructure and massive underinvestment in health and education.  This is the time to fix the leaks and make sure that when the storm comes we are not facing a housing or other crisis.

The Commission is now bringing forward two different tools to allow member states to do that but if that money is going to be made available to countries to help them to deal with particular shocks, there must be a degree of conditionality attached.  If we find ourselves in a position in a number of years time where Irish taxpayers' money is going into these funds and is being used in countries other than our own, then the Oireachtas will expect that funding to be used in a way that meets certain criteria.

Under the reform delivery tool, &euro;22 billion will be available for member states in direct exchange for doing what the Commission tells them under the national surveillance of budgets process.

The European Union operates to the fundamental principle of the freedom of movement of goods and services.  I am free to buy any product from Germany, France, or Spain, for example, except for financial products or services such as mortgages.  I raise this issue in light of the retail interest rate statistics for the eurozone published by the Irish Central Bank last week.<\/p><p>Chart 2 of the statistics document shows that the average interest rate across the euro area on all new mortgages agreed in April was 1.8%.  It shows significant variations across the eurozone.  The lowest rate was in Finland, where it was 0.8%.  The highest rate was in Ireland, at 3.15%.  Therefore, it is a fact that Ireland is the most expensive country in the eurozone for mortgage holders.  The Minister can rationalise that and give his view as to why it is the case.  He has an obligation not only to deal with the issue domestically but also to lead the charge at European level to ensure we have a properly-functioning Single Market for financial services.

The banking union measures that were referred to are dealing with a different issue entirely, namely, the stability of our banking system.  It is not acceptable to me that Irish mortgage interest rates are so far above the European Union average in the way I know and in the way the Deputy has described.  It is worth making the point that a factor contributing to the difficulty that exists on the balance sheets of banks and, in turn, regarding the interest rates they can offer to customers is the level of non-performing loans that we have.  The proportion of non-performing loans in Ireland is 14%.  The European Union average is 4%.  As continued efforts are made to reduce responsibly the proportion of non-performing loans, banks will be enabled to offer more attractive lending rates to new and existing customers.

Is the Minister saying to me and to Irish consumers that this is the main reason the rates here are so out of line and that Ireland is the most expensive of 19 states in the eurozone?  The Central Bank of Ireland seems to be doing nothing about this.

As to what we will do about it, we have a national competitiveness board and its mandate has been changed also to take account of productivity.  We will have to work harder to maintain and improve our competitiveness in the future.  Some of the competitiveness we achieved in recent years was yielded by where we were in our economic cycle and how sharply a number of things fell.

I thank the committee for this invitation to discuss supports provided by the Department for people with disabilities, particularly in respect of employment.<\/p><p> I will focus on three key areas as follows: working with other Government agencies and services to ensure good cross-governmental functioning to secure better employment outcomes; providing a range of income and employment supports and services to address the needs of people with disabilities; and engaging with people with disabilities to advise them of these supports and to guide them where appropriate to employment or to other services.<\/p><p> Before I say something about each of these, I would like first to recall some of the main statistics of relevance to this area.  According to Census 2016, there are almost 645,000 people living with a disability in Ireland.  In April 2016, there were 130,000 people with a disability at work of which 122,000 were in the working age population range.  People with disabilities, however, are still only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  Census 2016 figures show that the employment rate for people with disabilities of working age is 37% compared with a rate of 73% for people of working age without a disability.<\/p><p> We know that many people with disabilities want to work.  In our survey of 2015, 35% of people not then working said they wanted to work part time, while 8% said they wanted to work full time.  Young people with disabilities are likely to start out with lower employment rates and the gap widens with age as people leave employment.<\/p><p> The data tell us that to improve employment rates we need a twofold approach: early engagement with young people with disabilities and a focus on retention of those already established in the workforce.  For young people, the potential benefits are greatest in the crucial years following school to young adulthood when otherwise their disability threatens to keep them out of the workforce.  For older people, the advantages of early engagement can also apply to those who acquire disabilities later in life and who may need retraining and other supports to stay in the workforce.<\/p><p> The comprehensive employment strategy was adopted by Government in October 2015 having been developed in consultation with Departments, State agencies, the National Disability Authority, NDA, and disability stakeholders.  The ten-year strategy is a cross-governmental one co-ordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality and provides a roadmap to ensure that people with a disability who are able to and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is engaged in delivering 33 actions through the comprehensive employment strategy.  Progress to date includes the publication in April 2017 of the Make Work Pay report.  This was an interdepartmental report with independent external participation and chaired by Professor Frances Ruane.  We have either implemented or made significant progress on some of the recommendations and I will return to some of these later.<\/p><p> The Department has worked jointly on the pilot project to integrate employment and mental health support which was developed with Genio and departmental funding and in partnership with the HSE mental health division, EmployAbility companies and Mental Health Reform.  A central objective of this project was to improve integration between public mental health and supported employment services at national and local levels.  There has been joint working, supported by the National Disability Authority, NDA, with the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills, on action 5.1 which focuses on transition points for people with disabilities.  The group has produced a report agreed by Government, to be published shortly, outlining the policy approach and an implementation plan.<\/p><p> More generally, the Department participates in the comprehensive employment strategy implementation group chaired independently by Mr. Fergus Finlay who produces an annual report.  We provide a range of income and employment supports.  The primary income supports for people with disabilities are disability allowance, invalidity pension and partial capacity benefit.  Disability allowance is a means-tested payment for people who are aged between 16 and 66.  To qualify a person must be substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment.  Disability allowance is structured so that a person who wishes to do so may take up employment and still retain all, or a significant portion of, his or her payment, thereby ensuring that work is seen to pay.  The first &euro;120 of weekly earnings is disregarded in the means test for the payment while weekly earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are assessed at 50%.  A single person earning more than &euro;420 a week can retain the minimum amount of disability allowance and continue to qualify for the free travel pass.<\/p><p>A number of contributors to the joint committees mentioned that uncertainty around the retention of benefits, including the medical card, represents a barrier to people with disabilities exploring their work options.  The Make Work Pay report made a number of recommendations, including that the requirement that work be of a rehabilitative nature for the disability allowance earnings disregard should be dispensed with.  This would mean that a report from a doctor would no longer be required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity.  Legislation is required to give effect to this change and is included in the Social Welfare Bill 2017.  Currently, 10% of disability allowance recipients - about 13,000 people - avail of the disability allowance earnings disregard.<br\/><br\/>Other recent changes to the income supports to make them easier to retain if employment is taken up include the extension of entitlement to a travel pass to five years after commencing full-time employment or exceeding the appropriate income threshold, which exceeds the three years recommended in the Make Work Pay report; a fast-track return to disability allowance if employment does not work out; a clear statement that disability allowance payments will not be stopped or reviewed on the basis of an enquiry about work at an Intreo centre; and the introduction of an online benefit of work estimator to assist people with disabilities in assessing the impact of taking up work on their disability payment.  Since the launch of the Make Work Pay report, just over 800 disability allowance recipients have entered full-time employment and ceased claiming the allowance.<br\/><br\/>Invalidity pension<b><\/b>is an income support payment paid to people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or disability.  It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and is not means tested.  While invalidity pension is generally paid to pension age, where a person with a disability wishes to return to work, he or she may apply for partial capacity benefit.  Partial capacity benefit was introduced in February 2012 and is designed for people who are in receipt of long-term social insurance invalidity, illness or disability income support payments who have some capacity for work.<br\/><br\/>As well as providing these income supports, the Department also provides a range of supports specifically intended to improve employment outcomes for persons with a disability.  The EmployAbility service, for example,<b><\/b>is a nationwide employment service funded by the Department and dedicated to improving employment outcomes for jobseekers with a disability.  There are 23 limited companies, each with a specific geographical remit.  The Ability programme<b><\/b>is the new pre-activation programme for young people.  The focus of the programme will be on projects aimed at young people who have disabilities and who are aged between 15 and 29 and it is designed to assist in their transition from school to further education and employment.  This will be undertaken using person-centred, case management approaches that support participants to identify and follow progression pathways based on both their needs and their potential.  We also provide a range of grants under the reasonable accommodation fund and the disability awareness training support scheme to assist employers in the private sector to take appropriate measures to enable a person with a disability or impairment to have access to employment.<br\/><br\/>The Department also funds two significant disability projects directed at participants in third level education.  The Willing Able Mentoring programme, WAM, builds the experience and confidence of graduates with disabilities and employers through the method of a mentored work placement programme which is paid for by the employer programme.  Get AHEAD is a training programme and forum for students and graduates with disabilities to discuss their experiences of education and employment.<br\/><br\/>On engaging with persons with disabilities through the public employment service, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, DEASP, network of 62 Intreo centres provides a gateway for people with disabilities who wish to explore their work options and they may voluntarily look for an appointment with a case officer to discuss their work ambitions and develop a personal plan to progress their goals.  We recognise that our engagement with people with disabilities will require developing our employees' skills in engaging with them.  In November 2016, a certificate in professional practice in employability services provided through the National College of Ireland was introduced for DEASP staff.  There is good coverage of disability issues, including a guest lecturer who is a specialist in the area, and contributions from two staff development unit case officer trainers specialising in DEASP supports for people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned earlier, the publication of the Make Work Pay report in April 2017 marked an important step in the identification of specific actions that are intended to secure better employment outcomes for people with disability.  The report made many recommendations, including that disability allowance payments and other schemes should be reconfigured for new entrants aged 18 and over to ensure that their work ambitions could be explored systematically at an early age.  This is referred to as the principle of early engagement.<\/p><p> Following the publication of the report and the recognition that some of the recommendations may be controversial, the then Minister indicated that the Government wanted to consult persons with disabilities and their families on some of the recommendations.  We engaged an experienced facilitator to ensure the consultation process was as wide-ranging as possible and included representation from a wide range of stakeholders.  The information documents were designed to allow people with disabilities and their families to provide an input to the process.  We made considerable efforts to ensure that the materials were fully accessible.  The documents were also produced in a range of accessible formats such as easy read, Braille, audio, video captioned and Irish Sign Language.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, and Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, launched the consultation process in Richmond Barracks, Inchicore, Dublin 8, on 7 March 2018.  Regional seminars were held in Cork, Dublin, Sligo and Limerick during March and April this year.  The findings of the consultation process are being consolidated and a report will be prepared for the Minister and Minister of State on the outcome of the consultation process when it is finalised to inform the next steps in the implementation of the Make Work Pay report. <\/p><p> In conclusion, I hope this presentation demonstrates that while many supports and services are in place to assist people with a disability to fulfil their employment ambitions, the Department is very active in addressing the objectives of the comprehensive employment strategy in trying to improve the employment rates of people with a disability.  The multifaceted nature of the barriers faced by persons with a disability calls for a similarly multifaceted approach and the Department is pursuing a range of actions across a number of areas to achieve this.  The fall in unemployment and the transformation of the Intreo service provide an opportunity to make significant progress in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Simonetta Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528801200,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I thank the Co-Chairman and members.  I am principal officer in the special education section of the Department of Education and Skills.  I am joined by Phil O'Flaherty, who is the principal officer for further education and training in the Department.  I apologise for the late delivery of our remarks; I was out of the country late last week which contributed to the delay.<\/p> <p>  I thank the joint committees for the invitation to today's meeting.  We are aware of the joint hearings of 3 and 29 May and will try to address the matters highlighted during those meetings.  Our\u00a0 statement today will primarily address the provisions made for supporting children with special educational needs to support participation in further studies, training or employment, the supports available in the further education sector to facilitate access to further education and the transition from further education to employment and career guidance for those with a special educational need.  <\/p> <p>  The Department recognises the importance of planning for transitions throughout a child's education and at present all schools are required to develop education plans for all children identified with special educational needs and additional care support needs.  The Department's inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special educational needs, which is welcomed by the Department.<\/p><p>Educational plans should be differentiated in line with pupils' needs.  A student's support plan should include clear, measurable learning targets and specify the resources and interventions that will be used to address student needs in line with the continuum of support process.  Individualised support plans for students should be developed through a collaborative process involving relevant teachers, parents and guardians, the pupils themselves and outside professionals, as necessary.  The individualised planning process should include regular reviews of learning targets as part of an ongoing cycle of assessment, target setting, intervention and review.<\/p><p> Members may know that the comprehensive review of the special needs assistant, SNA, scheme was published by the NCSE on 30 May.  It has found that while the scheme is greatly valued by parents, students and schools and works well in meeting the care needs of younger students it is less effective for some older primary and post-primary students, as over-reliance on SNA support has been found to result in some of students experiencing alienation and stigma.  It also found that there can be an overdependence on SNA support, leaving some young people inadequately prepared for life in post-school settings, and it is seen as a blunt instrument to deal with the wide range and variety of needs, ages, developmental stages and school settings.  The Department is now developing proposals to implement the review's recommendations in consultation with other key Departments and agencies.<\/p><p> Turning to further education, a major focus of the further education and training strategy is to deliver skills for the economy and support active inclusion of all citizens.  These twin goals are closely connected and both point to the importance of assisting people with disabilities to access employment.<\/p><p> Overall in 2017, more than 17,000 people with a disability were enrolled in a wide range of mainstream further education and training, FET, programmes.  Details on all FET programmes are available on the FET courses website.  Learners on FET programmes have access to appropriate guidance services.  Some programmes also provide income support by enabling learners to retain their entitlements under schemes provided by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and have provision for meal and travel allowances.  The Higher Education Authority fund for students with disabilities also funds services and support for students with a disability in post-leaving certificate colleges.<\/p><p> SOLAS and the Department meet regularly with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss issues relating to the training and upskilling of unemployed people and those on other payments.  Protocols are in place between Intreo offices and education and training boards, ETBs, to deal with issues relating to the planning of training and the management of referrals.  This provides a good opportunity for the Department, SOLAS and the ETBs to assist the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as it looks to extend the employment services and supports for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> SOLAS, through the education and training boards, also provides specific funding of almost &euro;47 million per annum for dedicated education and training for people with disabilities through specialist training providers.  More than 3,500 learners benefitted from this provision in 2017.  Generally, this provision is accessed by people who need more intensive support.  Features of the programme include longer duration, adapted equipment and transport arrangements.<\/p><p> SOLAS regularly commissions follow-up surveys to establish what happens to participants, primarily in terms of outcomes, after they leave the FET training delivered by ETBs.  The most recent follow-up survey was conducted in 2017 and it surveyed those who exited ETB training in the period from January to March 2016.  Within this survey, a customised survey to gain feedback from participants with a disability who participated in specialist training programmes, STPs, was conducted.  The findings included outcomes indicating that 26% were in employment, 4% were on Government schemes and 15% were engaged in further study.  There are plans to extend the approach to monitoring outcomes in order that we can also get a better picture of how people with disabilities on mainstream programmes do after completing their courses.<\/p><p> SOLAS engages with ETBs each year to discuss funding priorities, taking account of local need and labour market data.  This year, SOLAS has required ETBs to set out how they are addressing barriers to accessing FET.  This is done in the light of the 2017 SOLAS report on barriers for vulnerable groups accessing FET.  A fuller picture of initiatives in place at ETB level will emerge from this process and provide a basis for determining future supports.<\/p><p> The Department recognises that there are still access difficulties in some FET settings.  Until now, the scope available to address these difficulties has been limited as no specific capital budget was allocated for FET.  Enhanced allocations of capital funds for the sector over the period of the national development plan will give greater capacity to address these issues.<\/p><p> Turning to apprenticeships, the Department noted that many contributors to the previous joint committee hearings spoke about the potential of apprenticeship to provide access for people with disabilities to the labour market.  A total of 371 current apprentices, out of a total population of almost 13,500, report as having a disability.<\/p><p>As part of a review on &quot;Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship&quot;, which is due to be completed at the end of June 2018, research is being undertaken on barriers to participation by people from diverse groups, including those with a disability.  Alongside this research, SOLAS is conducting caf&eacute; dialogue sessions to further inform recommendations for the review.  Attendees at the sessions have included individuals from organisations representing people with disabilities.  It is expected that the expansion of apprenticeship into new sectors, giving access to a much broader range of job opportunities and occupation types, will also assist in enabling people with disabilities access this valuable pathway to employment.  As members know, the Disability Act 2005 places an obligation on public bodies, including our own Departments, to ensure that at least 3% of their workforces are people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>I turn to career guidance for those with a special educational need.  Guidance in schools refers to a range of learning experiences provided in a developmental sequence that assist students to develop self-management skills which will lead to effective choices and decisions about their lives.  It encompasses the three separate but interlinked areas of personal and social development, educational guidance and career guidance.  For all children in mainstream post-primary schools, including those with special educational needs in mainstream or special classes, the support of the guidance counsellor is available where it has been provided to the school.  There is no other additional or separate guidance support for children with special educational needs and there is currently no policy to support an alternative or separate guidance provision for children with special educational needs in mainstream post-primary.  That is in keeping, I suppose, with the policy of inclusion which the Department supports.<br\/><br\/>In mainstream post-primary schools, it is common practice for the school guidance counsellor and the special educational needs, SEN, co-ordinator to work very closely in liaising with parents and the feeder primary schools, analysing psychometric assessments, identifying and supporting the needs of students with special educational needs, advising students and their parents on the most suitable subject choices and programme options, and facilitating students to secure appropriate work experience as part of the transition year, leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programmes.  The SEN and guidance teams collaborate in facilitating students to apply for supports such as the reasonable accommodation for certificate examinations, RACE, scheme, the disability access route to education, DARE, scheme and other access routes into further and higher education and employment.<br\/><br\/>A key role of the guidance counsellor is to develop close links with employers, access officers in colleges, SOLAS training and apprenticeship schemes and other organisations, such as the National Learning Network, with a view to maximising the opportunities for students with special educational needs and other disabilities to access further education, training and jobs.  The National Learning Network offers 70 different training programmes, including vocational and rehabilitative courses, to up to 5,000 students annually, many of whom have a disability and wish to up-skill, gain employment and live more independent lives.  The programmes are funded through the Education and Training Boards and the Health Service Executive.  The courses are free and individualised and offer a variety of awards including QQI levels 1 to 6, ECDL and City and Guilds.  Of those students who completed a training programme last year, 90% went on to further education and training.<br\/><br\/>For students in special schools<b>, <\/b>the position is somewhat different.  Special schools are substantially different from mainstream schools and these students typically have very different needs. <br\/><br\/>In all cases, the classroom teacher and other school staff are more intimately aware of the abilities and strengths of all students than would be the case in mainstream schools.  That is partly because of the average pupil-teacher ratio of less than 5:1 and the special needs assistant ratio of 3:1 in the majority of special schools.  Special school staff typically have extensive engagement with parents, HSE multi-disciplinary teams and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which involves planning for the child's future, including options for further education, training, employment or other placement options subject to the child's abilities, including the young person's transition to adult services when the child reaches the age of 18 years.  Students who transfer to adult service settings can continue to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or in adult settings which are allocated resources towards educational provision.<br\/><br\/>The National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 provide for a career guidance review that will include recommendations on changes to improve the existing career guidance tools and career information for post-primary, further education, higher education students and adults currently in place across the education and training system in Ireland.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that we are providing high quality, relevant career guidance information to students from post&ndash;primary level up to further and higher education.  The review will look at the quality of information available to students and adults in relation to career guidance, the sources of this information and how the system is organised to support students and adults in this area.<\/p><p>The review will look at the quality of information available to students and adults on career guidance, the sources of this information and how the system is organised to support students and adults in this area.  Opportunities have been provided for all relevant stakeholders to contribute to the review.  More than 100 written submissions have been received, including a significant number of submissions from special schools.  Drawing on the results of the consultation process and further consideration by the steering group, the specific role and objectives of career guidance in supporting students in special schools will be assessed further.<\/p><p> Related to the area of career guidance, some stakeholders have spoken about work experience.  The Action Plan for Education 2018 includes an action to commence a review of work experience at post-primary level with a view to increasing access to, and the quality of, work experience for students.  This review is at the early planning stages with a steering group to be established which will then define terms of reference and a project plan for the review.<\/p><p> While noting the broadly complimentary remarks made in a previous hearing concerning access to higher education for persons with disabilities, it may be helpful to provide some information on the higher education sector.  Student support services in higher education institutions usually include an equity of access office, dedicated disability services and a career guidance support service.  The central role of disability officers is to provide supports and services to students with disabilities to assist them in accessing higher education and successfully completing, as well as to ensure compliance with the legal requirement to provide reasonable accommodations as appropriate.  A key ambition of the National Access Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 is to achieve the implementation of more inclusive practices and integrated approaches which contribute to the realisation of a student body which reflects the diversity and social mix of the population.<\/p><p> Perhaps the most important measure of how well access to higher education is facilitated is to note that the proportion of higher education entrants indicating they have a disability has increased from 6% in 2012 to 10.3% in 2016.  The challenge, of course, is to maintain and build on these numbers.<\/p><p> The Department is represented on the working group of the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities strategic priority action 5.1, which is led by the National Disability Authority.  It focusses on transition points for people with disabilities.  The group has produced a report agreed by the Government, to be published shortly, outlining the policy approach and an implementation plan.<\/p><p> Significant progress has been made in supporting learners with disabilities across the range of school levels and into further and higher education.  The comprehensive employment strategy framework will also help us advance the cross-departmental co-operation which may be necessary in some areas.  It gives us visibility and access to colleagues in other Departments.

Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers, along with a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  Services, in the main, are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers.  Voluntary agencies provide the majority of services in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE.  The range of specialist disability services provided to people with disabilities includes residential; respite; day services and rehabilitative training; assisted living services, namely home support and personal assistant services; early intervention and school-aged services through progressing disability services for children and young people 0-18 years; multidisciplinary supports; aids and appliances; neuro-rehabilitation services; financial allowances; and miscellaneous support services.<\/p> <p>  Disability services were allocated &euro;1.78 billion in 2018.  This funding is providing specialist disability services to 36,000 persons across all nine CHO, community healthcare organisation, areas, ensuring that services are delivered in line with nationally agreed policy for persons with a disability, while, at the same time, endeavouring to maximise value.  A wide range of disability services is provided to those with physical, sensory, intellectual disability and\/or autism.<\/p><p>Over 60% of the resources available are allocated to provide a range of residential services to approximately 8,400 people with a disability.  A further 20% is targeted at the provision of more than18,000 day places and supports to nearly 25,000 people.  The remaining 20% provides respite care services to just over 5,700 people, over 4 million personal assistant and home support hours for 2,500 people, as well as multi-disciplinary teams and other community services and supports to children.<\/p><p> Last month, I met the Joint Committee on Public Petitions on the HSE-funded personal assistant service.  I am also aware that personal assistants, PAs, have been discussed in this forum.  The term \"personal assistance user\" refers to a person with a disability choosing a personal assistant of his or her choice to aid him or her in everyday tasks.  The 2004 Health Act does not mandate the HSE to provide PA services.  It is, rather, an ancillary service.  However, the Department of Health and the HSE are committed to protecting the level of personal assistant services available to persons with disabilities.  From 2013, the HSE has consistently, year on year, increased the number of hours of PA service delivered to persons with a disability.  Last year, 1.5 million hours were provide to approximately 2,500 people at a cost of &euro;42 million.<\/p><p> Day services are a key component of support services that enable service users to live within the community.  Currently, day services are transitioning to a new approach outlined in the policy, New Directions.  This policy is underpinned by the values of person centredness, community inclusion, active citizenship and quality.  There are approximately 25,000 people availing of day services and there is an annual intake of approximately 1,000 additional young people who require such a service on leaving school.<\/p><p> Within the New Directions service approach, people in receipt of a HSE-funded day service are offered a choice of 12 supports.  These include support for making choices and plans; support for inclusion in one's local community; support for accessing education and formal learning; support for maximising independence; and, support for accessing vocational training and work opportunities.<\/p><p> The first support referred to is support for making choices and plans.  This sets the foundation for each individual's service.  A person-centred plan is formulated for each individual and within that context, if a person has ambition to progress to employment, a plan is developed to support the person to achieve this target.  The plan may incorporate a range of all of the 12 supports.<\/p><p> The range of supports and the timeframe involved in supporting a person to achieve his or her goal will depend on the needs and abilities of each individual.  One of the key supports for people who express a wish to progress to employment is support for accessing vocational training and work opportunities.  Within this support, depending on a person's social and work-related skills, preparation for the world of work commences.  This support will include work experience placements which can act as a transition for people into employment.<\/p><p> The rehabilitative training programme, which is also provided within the framework of New Directions, acts as a foundation programme for people with disabilities.  Work-related social skills are also a key focus of this programme together with work experience placements and trialling of vocational training programmes.  There are rehabilitative training programme places available throughout the country.  Rehabilitative training places are managed at CHO level and are often reallocated or moved within the CHO area to meet demand.  They include all ages and disabilities, including mental health.<\/p><p> Since 2016, all HSE CHOs are allocated the funding required to meet the needs of all school leavers in their area.  All school leavers in 2017 received the quantum of day service requested and a similar outcome is envisaged for this year's school leavers.<\/p><p> The HSE is allocating &euro;12.5 million in 2018, that is, &euro;25 million in a full year, to provide appropriate services and supports to young people with disabilities and autism who will require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative - life skills - training this year.  As part of the annual school leaver day service process, each service user seeking a day service is individually profiled to ensure that he or she receives the level of support required.<\/p><p> The Department and the HSE works closely with the National Disability Authority and are grateful for its support in ensuring that the right supports are provided at the right time to support each school leaver to maximise his or her potential.<\/p><p> Earlier, I spoke about day services and employment supports.  The range of supports offered can include work experience, therapeutic work following a clinical recommendation, employment in the open labour market and supported employment.  Supported employment can include the national employability programme, which my colleague, Ms Simonetta Ryan, from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, spoke about, or service provider supported employment initiatives.<\/p><p>In the absence of appropriate supported employment programmes being available to people with disabilities in recent years the HSE has funded some providers to provide this element of employment.  This support will continue for those who are availing of it while a more responsive arrangement is developed as part of the comprehensive employment strategy.<\/p><p> The Department of Health and the HSE are collaborating with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills as part of the comprehensive employment strategy 2015-2024.  This initiative is led and co-ordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality, which has a co-ordinating role for disability matters.  With the assistance of the National Disability Authority, the Departments are exploring the development of a pilot project to test the policy approach for a comprehensive supported employment programme.  Such a programme could be implemented over 2018 to 2020 and focus on a specific target group.  This will provide learning for any future scaling of such an approach.<\/p><p> The 2017 report of the Make Work Pay group made two principal recommendations regarding medical cards to address a barrier to employment for people with disabilities.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has committed to deliver on the recommendation to raise the medical card earnings disregard from its current level of &euro;120 per week for people on disability allowance or on partial capacity benefit associated with invalidity pension.  The Department has collaborated with colleagues in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and is working with the HSE on the operational aspects to enable implementation of this recommendation as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> A second recommendation made by the group sought to amend the medical card guidelines requiring that employment must be of a rehabilitative nature for the associated income to be disregarded when being assessed for a medical card.  I am pleased to say that the guidelines were amended and the disregard has applied since April 2017.<\/p><p> Disability is not a health issue or an education issue or an employment issue.  It is, however, an equality issue and Government has had a whole-of-government approach to disability for a number of years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has responsibility for disability issues in the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Department of Health.  The Department of Justice and Equality is the lead Department for policy co-ordination for all disability and equality issues.  The Department of Health works on a cross-sectoral collaborative basis with colleagues in Departments on national policies for adults and children with a disability.  For instance, an interdepartmental cross-sectoral group at assistant secretary level meets regularly to ensure a co-ordinated approach to policy development across the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs, and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We know that more people with a disability have more complex needs.  Government is responding by providing the supports that people with disabilities need to live the full and independent lives that we all take for granted.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting me here today.  I am glad to have the opportunity to meet in such a collaborative forum and I am happy to take any health related questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patsy Carr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":628,"content":"<p>The first comment I wish to make relates to the three presentations.

Ms Carr said that disability is not a health issue or an education issue or an employment issue but an equality issue.  She said Government has taken a whole-of-government approach to disability for a number of years.<\/p><p>At our two previous sessions, the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, indicated that the current activation measures are not impacting on the employment rates of people with disabilities in post-recession Ireland.  That view is echoed by numerous other organisations that deal specifically with people with disabilities.  There are serious question marks over how successfully the measures are impacting on the ground.<\/p><p> To home in on one area, much has been said about the comprehensive employment strategy which has been in place for two years.  The strategy has not had any impact on the employment levels of people with disabilities.  That view is borne out by statistics that are available for everybody to see and have been referred to in a couple of presentations.  It has also been echoed by the DFI and other organisations.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has responsibility for 33 actions in the comprehensive employment strategy, most of which were to be delivered in 2016.  How many of those specific actions have been implemented?  I can state categorically that few of them have been implemented, even though the target date for implementation was 2016.

The most obvious action to point out is the large amount of work done on the Make Work Pay report, consulting people with a disability to try to come up with the best way to take matters forward.

In the past month or so, we have built on DACT by introducing a mainstream programme known as the Ability programme which implemented the findings of the review of the DACT programme.  The review included a number of recommendations, including several on systematic engagement with people with disabilities.  That recommendation also featured in the Making Work Pay report.  For the past year, my colleagues and I have been engaging with disability groups, parents and stakeholders on how this recommendation could be implemented in practice, particularly how the principle of early engagement with young people might be systematised in Intreo services.

I appreciate that this is a political arena and that it is not really up to civil servants to come and hang out to dry the Government of the day on what is not working, but the report is not balanced.  It talks about a lot of activity, but there is no critical analysis of what is working, or rather what is not working, where additional resources are required, where enabling legislation is required or anything else.  That is very disappointing because there is very little we can do with the information supplied.  The statements outline where we are at, but they do not really tell the Oireachtas what the Departments need and how we, as legislators, could help, particularly in the run-up to the next budget when there may be a little money to spend.

I will direct my first question at the HSE.  <\/p> <p>  I spent about half of Friday in the National Rehabilitation Hospital trying to help a young man to get out of it.  He was injured a year and a half ago and is paraplegic as a result of the injury.  He was discharged from the hospital last September.  I engaged with the HSE.  The family also engaged with it.  The young man in question was told that he would have to move back to Sligo to the intensive care unit to live out his days, which obviously is completely ridiculous.  He was told this because people were screaming at the National Rehabilitation Hospital for the bed he had.  He wants to lead his life and go back to work, but it took me and his family having his case highlighted on \"Prime Time\" and me raising it in the D&aacute;il to even get a response from the HSE.<\/p><p>I wrote multiple emails.  I, as a Member of Parliament and as Fianna F&aacute;il's health spokesperson, could not even get a response to my emails.  That is the reality.  The reality is that it is now June.  He was discharged last September but he is still there.  To be fair, at the table last Friday were people from stepdown facilities, senior clinicians and people from the HSE who have been trying very hard.  The reality is that he was discharged almost a year ago.  He is in the wrong setting and his bed is needed by about 50 other people.  That is the reality.<\/p><p> Can I ask the HSE how it can possibly be, with all this activity going on and all this emphasis on and work and money aimed at helping people with disability lead as full a life as they can, that someone can be discharged from the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, last September and still be meeting me, his clinicians and members of the HSE last Friday?

There are an awful lot of people in acute hospital beds all around the country waiting for those specific beds.<\/p> <p>  There is a new rehabilitation strategy and the desire is to move some of the services to the community but we do not have the staff.

There has been a lot of talk about the need for assessment and the need for transition.  Certainly in Wicklow, and I imagine in most if not in every other constituency, one of the most frustrating conversations one has as a Deputy when canvassing is to meet the parents of children with disabilities who are waiting for years for assessment.<\/p><p>I am not even talking about getting the supports; I mean for assessment.  I met a mother whose daughter has serious spinal issues who has been waiting a year for an assessment for a wheelchair because the curvature of the wheelchair that she has is wrong.  She is in pain and cannot use the wheelchair.  She sits on the ground for most of the time.  She is not waiting a year for a wheelchair; she is waiting a year for someone to assess the wheelchair requirement.  In the meantime the HSE will not fix wheelchairs and throws them into a big skip.<\/p><p> I talk to parents who are waiting literally years for speech and language assessment for their children.  We all know that early assessment is incredibly invaluable.  How is that happening?  Is anything being done to get the assessments and the supports in place for young children with various disabilities, be they physical, learning or intellectual disability.  It seems that things are moving in the wrong direction and that this is a profoundly stupid, dangerous, damaging and unnecessary thing for us a State to be doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#P00700","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528801200,"counter":664,"content":"<p>There are three separate questions there and I will have to bounce some of this back to Ms Carr because the main provider of assessments is the HSE.  However, we have a National Educational Psychological Service.  Its function is not to provide assessments but to upskill and support schools and to ensure that they are supporting children within the schools as well as they possibly can.  We are conscious of the long delays that have been there for assessments historically and we have been engaging with our colleagues in the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, in a cross-sectoral format on a very regular basis about this.  Back as far as 2012, we engaged with the National Disability Authority, NDA, and it was telling us at the time that assessments just for educational supports were costing the equivalent of in excess of 75 whole-time equivalent psychologists across the State.  We took the view that that was wasteful because it is better that our therapists and practitioners are providing services rather than assessing for services.  We were proactive about this and the committee will be aware that we introduced a new resource teacher allocation model in September 2017, which removed the need for an assessment in order that resources would be provided.  In the past, a child had to have an assessed disability before additional teaching hours were provided but that is no longer the case.<\/p> <p>  The special needs assistant, SNA, review I mentioned in my presentation contains similar recommendations.  Hopefully, if these recommendations are accepted and implemented by Government in the future, it will no longer be necessary for children to have an assessment of need before they can access SNA-type support.  I am conscious that that review also had a number of other recommendations which primarily all blend together to ensure that in future children will get the right support from the right person and at the right time.  In order that that would happen the over-reliance of the assessment of need process will be discontinued or rolled down.  We know, of course, that children will continue to need assessment for clinical reasons and perhaps to guide the professionals and practitioners in understanding the levels of support and the types of needs that children have.<\/p> <p>  On speech and language therapy, we are very conscious, that while the Department of Education and Skills is not currently the provider of speech and language therapy services, there is a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to develop an in-school approach and language support service to ensure that children can get access when and as they need support.  To that end, from this September, in collaboration with our colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we will roll out a pilot project across CHO 7, involving 76 schools, including a number of special schools, and 76 preschools, where therapy services will be delivered in school in line with the continuum of support service - a high level of support for the higher level of need; a middle level of support for the middle level of need and a whole school approach to children to try to identify and deal with needs as they first arise in order to try to prevent them from getting worse, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  That pilot is being rolled out in on a collaborative basis.  We work on a very regular basis with our colleagues in the Department of Health to ensure that the need for clinical governance and clinical support for therapists currently being recruited for this particular pilot will be available.  The HSE will do the recruitment process for us and the NCSE will manage the programme for us.  This heralds a new era of enhanced co-operation and collaboration between our Departments to ensure that children get access to supports without having to wait years for assessments.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, will manage the programme.

Something that came across very strongly was that the huge level of administrative and bureaucratic work that individuals have to undertake - sometimes in a supported capacity, since they may be lucky enough to have strong advocates, or they may not - seems to begin again at each new chapter in their lives.  There is a question of transition points.  A key reason we have all these Departments in together is those problems of transition points.  I will not ask for all of the points in the comprehensive employment strategy to be discussed.  I am sure we are due to receive a report on that.  It would have been wonderful if one that was mentioned was ready in time for these hearings since it relates strongly to them.  It is priority action 5.1, which focuses on transition points for persons with a disability.

That was a key question.  I will give input regarding a couple of points that really struck me on that issue of transition points from the testimony of others.  Special needs assistants were mentioned.  People may have had special needs assistance in our higher education institutions or post-primary institutions and then find themselves wishing to transition into employment but the educational supports that they had were tied to their educational chapter.  There are people who may have managed to navigate and, for example, receive a degree but in that period immediately afterwards, when it is so important for translating into employment, they are almost entering a brand new system cold, starting the negotiations again and trying to get support again, rather than having a period of overlap which allows them to transition into employment.  That was one example.  Those transitions are a key concern.  I welcome that there is a fast-track for those who may seek to leave disability allowance and return to it.  It is positive that that may happen a number of times.<\/p><p>I have a couple of concerns on the social protection system.  One is the fact that people can become invisible in terms of their disability at a number of points.  For example, if somebody transitions into full-time employment the fact he or she is a person with disability can become invisible.  We have talked about the level of income disregard on medical cards.  There are many situations when we talk about making work pay and the cost of disability where people may well need quite extensive medical supports over the course of a lifetime that are not going to go away and are not going to be fundable.  We heard from people who felt they had to go back on disability allowance because of that cost and the fear they would lose their entitlement to the medical card and who would have preferred not to be getting disability allowance and the medical card but simply getting the medical card.  However, they had to transition back to get both again.<\/p><p> The other concern I have is where people get to pension age and they disappear as somebody with a disability in terms of the visibility of that issue.  There were a lot of concerns on the question of the invalidity pension.  The transition to partial capacity benefit was mentioned.  Partial capacity benefit is an interesting one because the recognition of partial capacity is not as well recognised for those on a disability allowance, although they have the disregard.  Given that we know some people are working, using the income disregard while on disability allowance, and others are seeking to work, and perhaps Ms Ryan might answer this question, are there quality part-time educational and employment options that recognise that people may be available and seeking work on a part-time basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#R01200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Would the Senator like answers to some of those-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#S00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Yes.

We have the two different schemes - invalidity pension and disability allowance.  They are different schemes and have different conditionality.  One is based on contributions and the other is means-tested and the payment rates are slightly different.  It always becomes complicated if one tries to merge two schemes because it does not lend itself to it.  We are doing a lot on the ground with people and are developing our services to engage with people.  If the committee would like it, we can talk a little about what we are doing.  We recognise also that we have a lot more to do and that is what hopefully will come from the work we have done on the Make Work Pay and the article 5.1 group.  Part of that is to look at how one helps people who need more supports and what are the options as one goes forward.  All these things, to some extent, have to be iterative, because one has to try different ways of working to see what is going to work.<\/p> <p>  The Senator talked about the full-time or part-time option.  As regards part-time, we have the part-time capacity benefit for people on illness pension.  That is a good scheme.

There is an option for people on DA to work and to still retain quite a lot of benefits for quite a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Simonetta Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I am talking education and part-time options and not simply the entitlement to same.  I refer to things like quality part-time educational options.  For example, the CE scheme is one of the few schemes that is part-time.  Perhaps this is too micro in detail but that is not available to people on certain schemes.  The question is about quality part-time options.<\/p> <p>  Another key issue that relates to this is the concern around the invisible, that is, those who have a disability but because disability allowance is means-tested may not be on disability allowance and, moving away from the payments, their access to the educational, the training and the employment supports.  That is what I was talking about in terms of there being suitable good quality options.  Are they available to people, regardless what payment scheme they are on, and to those who may not be on a payment scheme but who may have a disability?<\/p> <p>  The other witnesses might answer my question on what we heard about the iterative process because there is a real concern here.  Disability is one of the issues that has not landed suddenly; it is one of the most known issues.  We know it is a long-term fact of society and yet it seems there is a huge reliance on pilot schemes.<\/p><p>JobPath, for example, scaled up very quickly and yet we have had a litany of excellent practice schemes which seem to have come and gone.  WALK PEER was mentioned as was the three-year funding.  Is it national?  Is it available everywhere?  There is the Care project and the Inclusive Learning Project at Maynooth University, about which we heard great things but then the funding stopped.  There is also the Career Pathways, a transition to employment scheme in Trinity College.  There is a litany of excellent good-practice schemes.  However, what seems to happen is that the pilots are put in place but then the scale-up does not happen.  I am very concerned about a new project, namely, the pilot project testing the policy approach for a comprehensive supported employment programme.  This is just another example, which will be a pilot from 2018 to 2020, and will provide learning for any future scaling of such an approach.

Ms Ryan raised the issue of the role of the Intreo offices.  As members are probably aware, there was some major reconfiguration of further education and training and the employment service whereby training, delivered by F&Aacute;S in the past, moved to newly-created education and training boards, the former vocational education committees, that also delivered vocational education.<\/p> <p>  There are protocols in place locally with all the Intreo offices and the education and training boards.  That is giving Intreo offices a much greater visibility as to the full range of education and training offerings that are out there where previously most of the referrals would have been to the training side because the employment and training side were together in F&Aacute;S at one point.  That includes quite a lot of part-time provision - for example, the back to education initiative and a range of programmes at various levels, including in areas like literacy, numeracy, digital skills and basic skills.<\/p><p> More broadly, in further education, training and, indeed, higher education, there is a major push to increase the range of flexible options available.  Members will be aware of the Springboard programme, for example.  Springboard was previously heavily pushed towards people who were unemployed, were on jobseeker's assistance or benefit but now it has been opened up much more broadly and provides good options, including for people in employment, which may include people with disability.  There has been a considerable push and some funding through the higher education funding mechanisms, through the Higher Education Authority, and also in further education, through SOLAS, on technology-enhanced learning, with blended approaches.  That is through both the use of technology in classrooms, which is something that can be very important to people with disabilities, and also online, with blended approaches which deliver greater flexibility.  It is reasonable to say that those protocols have been in place for two years for Intreo offices and ourselves.<\/p><p> Our Department, SOLAS and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regularly meet on a tripartite basis to review how that is working locally.  As the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection broadens its focus more clearly beyond people who are unemployed - and some capacity maybe has freed up in Intreo services - our Department also needs to look at how we can support the broader range of clients that are likely to come our way.

I had to attend another meeting.  It is very difficult when two meetings are being held at the same time.<\/p> <p>.  I welcome our guests.  I have a couple of quick comments.  Something that has become obvious to me and, I am sure, everybody in public life is that families that are affected by disability spend much of the time waiting for something to happen, waiting for services to kick in or waiting for attention.  It has become a burden to them with the anxiety that is attached.  Can the Departments do anything to try to eliminate that?  For example, why should children with special needs of an acute nature have to wait indefinitely for urgent surgical procedures?  These families have to wait a long time and they do not know when an outcome will be forthcoming<\/p> <p>   The burden on families has to be experienced by means having close contact with the families.  These people will readily relate the facts.  The mother of a teenager who has a serious disability recently informed me that she has been at it for 20 years, day and night and on call all the time.  She said that some things are well done and some are not; that sometimes provision was made and sometimes it was not.  Certain families have more than one member with a disability and that increases the burden.  I would like the service providers to bear that in mind when they refer to waiting.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the disability allowance versus the invalidity pension, the former is insurance-based but there was a tradition whereby a person, a year from coming off a disability allowance, particularly when coming off a domiciliary care allowance, automatically qualified for an invalidity pension.  This does not happen any more.  That is a huge disadvantage to people who may have a limited income and who may find themselves in a difficult position.  Any extra money is a huge advantage to them.<\/p><p>That needs to be looked at again.<\/p><p> This is important and I do not want an answer to it.  It is a comment.  Some people can overcome disability to a huge extent, whether a physical disability or a sensory disability.  Others cannot.  Others may find the disability so overpowering, whether inherited or a disability following an accident, that they find themselves at a huge physical and psychological disadvantage and feel unable to cope, and feel very pressurised, as I saw at a recent case where it was suggested that an amputee should seek employment.  It was an appalling decision.  I cannot understand how an official or anybody could stand over a decision like that.  The simple reason was the unfortunate person was at a very severe physical disadvantage to start with and, to overcome that physical disability mentally, in itself, was a huge issue for him.  To suggest to the person concerned that he should be looking for a job and there was no reason he should not get a job is crazy.<\/p><p> The Intreo people have been referred to.  The jury is still out on that for me.  They have done some interesting and useful work but they have also gone off on a tangent on some occasions where a little more thought could have gone into what eventually became a decision and a burden on the people affected by that decision.  I am not asking for answers.  I am making a comment.  I have serious concerns about the things I have mentioned because I have daily contact with people who are affected in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#U00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Deputy in a moment.  I want to be fair to the witnesses we had here a couple of weeks ago.  I will make a couple of comments and they can be referred to specifically.  I reflected on it before I came in.  Something the witnesses all said collectively was that they felt lucky about where they have got to.  Despite all the programmes and policies we have in place, they all felt lucky to have worked through the system and for their entitlements.  They all came by different pathways but there was an element of luck.  That was the way they felt about it and, in that way, there is something wrong with the system in that there are not clearer, more identifiable pathways onto which those people or their advocates can see them.  They all referred to it as luck.  I was very taken with it.  The witnesses have quite rightly explained a significant range of programmes that are available but the people who are to avail of them do not see it as easily as that.  Information and education are issues.<\/p> <p>  I will address a couple of specifics that the individuals referred to, in no particular order.  One lady spoke about what she was able to do because she had a personal assistant.  She was a little bit older and had the personal assistant for some time, but she made the point that if she was a younger person, she would not have access in the same way that she does.  She recognised the old system versus the new system and was quite specific in it.  We had one person who spoke about special needs assistants and their support in primary, secondary and third level.  There was no continuity of support.  There was a significant drop-off in second level and they were quite impressed with the level of support they got in third level.<\/p> <p>  We heard about the special schools and the fact that, in many of them, there is no pathway either to do the leaving certificate or applied leaving certificate, and what that means for those people in the future.  Mr. Mulkerrins alluded to the fact that careers guidance in those special schools is not done in the normal way, as it would be done in a regular school.  These were highlighted.  Everyone expressed concern about the loss of the medical card or the travel pass.  They all said to us in different ways that, while they might have a job, they still have their disability and the associated costs that go with it.<\/p><p>While they might have a job, the people concerned still have disabilities and face associated costs.  We need to look at more than just means testing.  One of the delegates is visually impaired.  Some of the equipment covered by the medical card scheme is relatively expensive and she faced a huge personal burden.  When the transition is considered in the round, people with disabilities face additional costs in getting to work.  There is a feeling of nervousness and vulnerability in losing the medical card and free travel.  <\/p><p> There was much talk about the disability allowance and illness benefit.  I understand there are approximately 2,500 in receipt of partial capacity benefit.  It was rightly set out that the person was assessed.  My experience of partial capacity benefit is that many persons who are availing of it and have re-entered the workforce do not have a regular weekly salary because many do not work full time.  The partial capacity benefit does not recognise whether a person has worked in a given week.  Such persons are on a reduced payment, in comparison to the previous benefit of which they availed.  We should look at the benefit specifically for those who are beginning to go back to work where the nature of the work is part time or casual or for a few hours a week.  That is the stepping stone for them, but partial capacity benefit is only for a set amount, irrespective of what a person earns in a given week.  I suggest a system be put in place to provides the full benefit if a person has not worked in a given week for a specified period of time.  For many, it is a transition.  <\/p><p> My colleagues will speak briefly about this issue, but they are the main points.  I am taken by the reports and the actions proposed for the future, but I emphasise that the delegates who were here a couple of weeks ago all said they were lucky.  They had all transitioned and were making progress in their lives.  However, there was a feeling there was no clear stepping stone or that another person could follow exactly what they had done.  There was a feeling those who had transitioned had met the right person at the right time or had been on the right programme at the right time.  I was taken when I heard the delegates say that they had got lucky.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#V00200","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I was struck by what was said about technology in assisted learning.

This applies not only to the provision of reasonable accommodation for those in work but also to the provision of reasonable accommodation in applying for work.

This matter needs to be investigated further, but I am confident that it is going to happen in the next couple of months.<\/p> <p>  We all agree with Deputy Durkan on his point about families waiting for services and assessments for whom this is particularly traumatic, especially those with children with special needs who are then going for acute services.  I was only made aware recently that there are disability liaison nurses in the major acute hospitals, so those processes for a child with a disability requiring acute services can be streamlined.  That is a positive.<\/p> <p>  No one disputes the huge burden families face.  This year, as part of the Estimates for 2018, the Government allowed an extra &euro;10 million to provide extra respite services.

This is having a positive impact throughout the country, and we would hope to build on that next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#X00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Patsy Carr"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528801200,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I will make three points, if I may.  The first is a general point that I imagine reflects all of our views.  The Department of Education and Skills accepts that while it has provision and policies for support in place, individual experiences may not necessarily reflect that.  We are aware that individual experiences are less than satisfactory, and it makes it all the more important that we have opportunities to come to committees to hear about individual experiences.  We also hear about such experiences through parliamentary questions and representations as well.  We are very conscious of it, and it affords us an opportunity to try to modify our arrangements to make the individual experiences better.<\/p> <p>  On the second point, I read some of the presentations that were made at earlier meetings about special needs assistants, SNAs, the experiences of one particular person at primary, secondary and third level, and the drop-off in the service that person experienced at second level.  I was somewhat surprised by that individual example, because if I recall the case correctly the drop-off occurred during leaving certificate year.  I was surprised to hear that because we operate a policy, between ourselves and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that when an SNA allocation is reviewed, unless there was absolute clarity that the individual need had diminished substantially, there would be no removal of that level of support in the final year.  I suspect that was an individual example of something falling through the gaps.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure when this happened, but I would make the point that between 2001 and 2010, the number of SNAs in the system grew by approximately 1,000 every year.  There was a period of cooling off between 2010 and 2013, largely because of the economic downturn, I suspect.  However, we continued to make additional provision.  By the end of this year there will be 15,000 SNAs in the system.  A person attending school ten years ago may not have had the same level of access to SNA support as one would get now.  We recognise that the levels of need have not changed greatly in the intervening years.  The levels of assessed understanding of what those needs are has changed very substantially.<\/p><p>All of those needs existed in pupil populations ten, 20 and 30 years ago.  We just were not supporting them the way we should have done, or in the way we now understand we needed to do.  <\/p><p> Two points were raised about special schools, the first was about pathways to leaving certificate and applied leaving certificate.  The committee knows that we have introduced levels 1 and 2 and there have been significant improvements in terms of accreditation for pupils.  It is important that students' performance and abilities are recognised.  In respect of the leaving certificate and applied leaving certificate there is a discussion between us and the National Council for Special Education which takes the lead in providing us with policy advice, having conducted research and consultation in the sector, about how we need to consider provision for special schools in the future.  There is a discussion about getting the balance right.  We recognise that there will always be children who will require the supports of special schools but who will have the capacity to go on and do leaving cert and applied leaving cert.  That, unfortunately, is not the case for the majority.  The issue is what the appropriate provision would be for pupils who are attending special schools but have aspirations to go on and do leaving cert applied and the ordinary leaving cert.  It is a matter of getting the balance between where provision should be made, whether children should be provided with greater levels of access, even part-time, perhaps in the mainstream or access to a special class with transition to mainstream for appropriate subjects and whether the needs are such that they require special schools.  That is a challenge we face and we hope to be able to improve our consideration of that over the coming year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018061200002#X00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Mulkerrins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":712,"content":"<p>That concludes today's meeting.

It is clear from the submission that the RTB supports the vast majority of what is proposed in the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill 2018.  I think we all support the proposal to give the RTB additional powers.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the proposal to simplify the regulations and the process, as alluded to in the submission.  I am sure the process is quite onerous for the RTB.  It is certainly onerous for tenants and landlords.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on a couple of things.  As I have said, they support the vast majority of the legislation.  What elements of it do they have concerns about?  I recognise the fact that their job will be to work with the legislation if and when it is passed.<\/p> <p>  As I have said to the Minister and officials from the Department, I support most of the additional powers that are proposed in this legislation.  It is all very well to provide for additional powers, but we need to consider how we can implement them and work with them in practice.  Maybe the witnesses can advise the committee regarding its current resources.  How many staff members does the RTB have?  How many case officers does it have?  What is the approximate case file workload at present?  I am not asking for an exact figure.  It is important that we get a sense of what the average workload of each of the RTB's case officers is.  What is the turnaround time within which specific disputes are concluded?  I know from my job as a Deputy for Dublin Fingal that some disputes are not concluded and go on for quite some time.  Are the performance indicators that have been set by the RTB being met?<\/p> <p>  As we try to improve the rights of tenants, in particular, and private landlords, we need to make sure the RTB is properly resourced.  What does it need?  In an ideal world, what extra resources would it have to implement these powers?<\/p> <p>  Is it okay to ask the witnesses for their view on the possibility of the RTB taking responsibility for issues relating to owner-occupied management companies?  As they will be aware, this committee, under the leadership of the Chair, has been doing substantial work on this matter.  We believe this element of the residential sector needs to be strengthened because approximately 500,000 people are living in owner-occupied managed estates.<\/p> <p>  My focus is on the aspects of the proposed legislation that the representatives of the RTB do not like.  What additional powers, if any, do they want?  How are they going to implement this legislation?  What staffing and other resources will be needed?<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chair for her indulgence.  I have a final question.  If this legislation is passed, how quickly do the witnesses envisage that they will be able to get up and running with the additional powers and regulations that are provided for in it?  I will leave it at that for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#B00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":719,"content":"<p>Some of my questions have been covered by Deputy O'Brien, so I will not repeat them.  I want to make it very clear that we have indicated to the Minister that we are very supportive of the principle of the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill 2018.  I think most members of this committee have said we would like to assist the Minister in having it proceed as speedily as possible.  Given the current state of things, it is unusual that we are in such agreement, but it is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  Like Deputy O'Brien, I would like to know whether there are any additions to this Bill that the RTB would like us to consider in the tight timeframe that is in front of us between now and the recess.  We discussed the timeline with departmental officials when they appeared before this committee at an earlier stage.  I suggested to them that even if we pass this legislation by the summer, the need to issue the regulations, allocate additional resources and deal with the RTB's IT issues means that in real terms, it is likely to be January or February of 2019 before the RTB is able to act on this legislation.  I ask the witnesses to confirm if that is the case.  Can they talk us through the rationale for that?  Can they share with the committee some of the issues with which they are contending in respect of IT interfaces?<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to give us a little detail on the level of resourcing the RTB will need if these new powers are to be effective.  Can they tell us, without putting themselves in a difficult position, whether they have had any conversations with the Minister or with officials in the Department about resource allocation?  Obviously, that would be a matter for the budget.  If the Opposition needs to lobby for additional resources between now and the budget, we will be happy to do so.  It would be better if we were in a position to do it on the basis of what is actually required.<\/p> <p>  Like a number of Deputies, I am looking at potential amendments to this Bill to include things that are not covered in the heads of the Bill at present.  We have had a significant discussion on the need to have student licences covered by the rent pressure zones.  The D&aacute;il passed a Bill without opposition from the Government that proposes to include student licences of some form under the rent pressure zones and under the RTB more generally.  The Bill in question received unanimous support on the Opposition benches.  Do the witnesses have a view on it?  I understand that some student cases might be in front of the RTB at present.  Are the witnesses in a position to comment on any of that?<\/p><p>We also had a very significant debate in 2016, when the rent pressure zones were being introduced, on changes to the Residential Tenancies Act to limit the number of families receiving vacant possession notices to quit from buy-to-let landlords to try to stem the flow of families into homelessness.  The Focus Ireland amendment, as it was called, was a specific restriction in order that landlords who had bought properties during the boom with buy-to-let tax break mortgages would not be able to issue a vacant possession notice to quit when selling that property.  They could sell it but with the tenant<i>in situ<\/i>.  Do the delegates have a view on that or other measures that could be taken, through amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act or this legislation, that could assist us in deaing with the homelessness crisis?  <br\/><br\/>Are the delegates in a position to say anything about the index they have just given to us?  I invite them to say a little about it, following which I might have another short supplementary question for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#B00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin in his comments on student accommodation.  As I understand it, there is unanimous agreement in the D&aacute;il that it should be included in rent pressure zones.  Will the delegates give us their views on that matter and how it could be managed?  I also seek their views on the proposed deposit protection scheme.  What is the position on implementation of such a scheme?  All members of the committee are concerned about the delay in setting up such a scheme, to which Threshold referred again recently.<\/p> <p>  The Bill provides the Residential Tenancies Board with independent powers of investigation.  The board will no longer have to receive a complaint before initiating an investigation.  How do the delegates see that working in practice?  Will it involve random sampling or will an investigation be triggered by information derived from particular sources?  Will the board, for example, investigate 20% of tenancies over a specific period?  Will the delegates expand a little on that provision?<\/p> <p>  There is strong support in the House for the Bill which will strengthen enforcement in rent pressure zone, but I am concerned about areas outside them, some of which are in my constituency in Wicklow where we are seeing enormous increases in rent because landlords are afraid that they will be included in rent pressure zones in the future.  To be fair to most landlords, the rents they are charging are way below market values, particularly in places such as Arklow.  The big towns of Wicklow, Greystones and Bray are in a rent pressure zone but Arklow is not.  Information coming to us is that because landlords in Arklow are afraid that it will be included in the next round, they are increasing rents significantly.  The delegates have referred to the fact that landlords with properties in rent pressure zones who were charging rents way below market rates do not now have the ability to move to market rates.  I ask them for their views on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#C00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for facilitating us by rescheduling the meeting and giving us the opportunity to discuss the legislation.

We have set out the issues of concern in our submission.  The main piece is that while we believe the legislation tries to get us to a path towards rent transparency, there is probably a little more we would do in that respect.  One of the things missing from the Bill is annual registration.  In the context of Deputy Pat Casey's question about investigations, the easiest way we can investigate is by having data in the first instance.  We need a smart IT system to do a lot of the work for us.  If we had data coming in on annual basis, we could use software to determine what rent increases were above 4%, what properties were exempt and so on, but in the absence of such a system, we will have to undertake a lot of manual work.  While I understand the Bill is a pathway towards rent transparency, there are some weaknesses within it.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of simplicity, under head No. 5, one of the suggestions is landlords should be obliged to tell us about any change to a tenancy as it occurs.  Failure to do so would be a criminal offence, but in terms of enforcement, that would not be very practical.  How would we know whether a landlord had told us or not?  How would we go about investigating it?  Furthermore, in terms of proportionality, criminal sanctions for a landlord who forgets to tell us about a rent review might be too much.  While landlords have obligations and need to be aware of them, the law has become so complicated that we need to be careful about keeping a streamlined approach.  These are the two areas in which we have some concerns.  While we support and agree with the vast majority of the Bill's provisions, we believe these two areas need to be considered further as the legislation is drafted, particularly in terms of implementation.  We must ask how we can implement these provisions while keeping things simple.  These are the two points I will repeat as we go through this legislation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of resources, we have sanction for 61 staff.  We have 53.8 whole-time equivalent, which means that we have eight vacancies.  As quickly as the Department gives us sanction, within the current economic space it is actually quite difficult for us to retain staff.  It is primarily related to broader issues, including the fact that we are public servants and staff do not have access to wider competitions and so forth.  Candidates will work in the Civil Service before they will come to work for an organisation such as the Residential Tenancies Board.  Furthermore, ours is a small organisation, with only one person working in human resources.  We have just gone to tender for a recruitment agency in order that we will be able to respond as vacancies arise or we receive sanction.  We are holding people for too long.  It is quite a big, open procurement process and the tender is valued at well over &euro;25,000.  It will, therefore, take us some time to go through it.  <\/p> <p>  Members have probably heard a lot of talk about a two-year change management plan.  Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin asked if it had been discussed with the Department and the Minister.  We have discussed it with them and the change management group has met on a number of occasions.  Our main focus is on ensuring we will not do anything on the back of an envelope.  We need to make sure we will get this right.  The Residential Tenancies Board has started from a place where it had a really bad reputation because it was badly resourced in the first instance.  We have done a lot of work to try to improve processing times.  We do not want the standard of provision of our core services to drop as we take on new functions.  We are, therefore, trying hard to get the balance right.  In that context, we have commissioned an external workforce plan which will take account of this new piece.  In that way, a body external to us will determine what we will require to do our job properly.  The contract was initiated yesterday and the plan will be completed in a two-month period.  The aim is to draw up the plan properly in order that it will cover not only this piece but also what the Residential Tenancies Board will require in the next few years.  I cannot say what resources will be required because the issue needs to be examined properly against the backdrop of the 340,000 tenants in the system.  The introduction of the GDPR, for example, has had a massive impact on our organisation because while we hold over 1 million records, we only have 60 members of staff.  It is a real challenge for us.  We are looking at all of these issues, including the compliance requirements for all organisations, as well as the new functions we have taken on.  <\/p> <p>  It is difficult to provide a figure for the average number of cases per staff member.  I have just said we have 53.8 staff members, but a large amount of our work is done through outsourcing.  Our staff numbers were reduced dramatically, from 70 to 35, in 2013.  As a result, we outsourced a large amount of the work.  All of the front-line work is done in a customer care centre, including the handling of all calls, as well as some of the case assessment, document management and general correspondence work.  Approximately 50 people are working on the contract within the call centre.  We have another 74 panel members who are independent decision-makers.   In order to maintain their independence, they are not employed directly by the Residential Tenancies Board, but they have a service level agreement with us.  Overall, approximately 200 people are working for the organisation.<\/p><p>To break that down per case would be difficult because-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I understand that.

One of the other questions Deputy Darragh O'Brien asked was about the processing times.  On average, for a determination order, it takes 14 weeks from the day the application is made to somebody getting the order.  How does that compare with the previous year?  We were at 12 weeks before this, which was our best ever number.  The drop is down to the fact we are taking on more functions without the staff complement coming back in to replace us.  That goes to what Ms Walsh was saying.  We need to protect it and ensure it does not drop any further.  We need to ensure that cases that come to us are dealt with swiftly.  That is one of our priorities.  Our strategic plan is within that.  It is important to point out that while it is at 14 weeks, 48% of the cases we take on are dealt with within one to two months so while the average is sitting at 14 weeks, we deal with a lot of cases through early intervention and they are dealt with early on in the process.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked questions about this as well.  There is quite a lot in the heads of the Bill and there are certain elements that could come in quickly and which we would like to come in quickly.  One is the register of the exemptions from RPZs.  I will go through the rent index details with the Deputy but for us, looking at those numbers is a bit like a grey fog in some ways.  Until I know what impact those exemptions are having on the overall rent index, it is very difficult for us to say what is happening within the market.  That is something we could implement very quickly.  It would not need a significant change to our IT system and it means we would have the data there and would be easily able to segregate the data to see what is actually happening in the market.  It would also give us a sense of how well it is being used as a provision within the existing legislation.  It is something that could be done on the enactment of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  On the security of tenure changes, we would like a couple of weeks more to look at the education and awareness piece.  We have a history of commencing legislation very quickly yet nobody can catch up with the changes.  It is more to ensure that landlords know about them and that we give people a little bit of time so they know what is coming at them and for us to amend all of the literature and so on.  We think that could come in fairly quickly.  The big thing that needs more work for us is the sanctions piece.  That is the one we need the lead-in time on.  Hopefully, when I have the workforce plan completed we can give the committee a fairly good indication on it.  I am hoping that covers that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#D01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":741,"content":"<p>It does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#D01800","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":742,"content":"<p>To answer Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question, in terms of the timeline I have pretty much covered it already.  I will go back to the idea of simplicity.  We need to think about how difficult we make it in legislation to implement or for people to understand.  In terms of the notices of termination that come before us, in 2015 69% of those were found to be invalid.  They were found to be invalid for technical reasons.  We have managed to reduce that down to just around 40% through our education programme.  Now we are seeing there is more regulation on the rent review side.  About 77% of the rent reviews coming before us are found to be invalid.  I meet landlords and tenants on a daily basis who do not understand what they are meant to be doing.  Tenants do not understand what they can come to us for and the landlords do not understand what they should be doing.  If we tried to keep things more simple it would be much easier for people to do that and also easier for us to implement in terms of supporting the sector.  I talk a lot about enabling regulation.  The regulation should not be about red tape, it should be about our objective.  The objective is to create a well-functioning rental sector that supports tenants and landlords when things are going wrong.  They are the things I would like to see as it goes through.<\/p> <p>  I have talked about the resource allocation and our discussions with the Minister.  <\/p> <p>  Student licences was the next issue that was brought up.  We believe that a lot of the student accommodation that is purpose built but within the private sector comes within our remit.  I want to be explicit about that because some of the press think it is not.  It is really important that tenants understand that they should take cases to us.  There are a lot of cases where people might claim that something is a licence.  It does not matter what it is called; it is about what its substance is.<\/p><p>If a tenant has peaceful and exclusive occupation of that dwelling, and is not being moved from room to room on a weekly or regular basis, these are two core principles that one would look at in terms of looking at student accommodation.  That is the first thing.<\/p><p> That does not mean that providing clarity in the legislation would not provide everybody with a bit more assurance on that.  I just wanted to say that because in the interim, before whatever legislative change might be necessary, it is important that if people are concerned and feel that a landlord may not be complying with the legislation, they should, in the first instance, talk to us to see if we can look at the case to see if it is a licence or a tenancy.  If it is a tenancy, it comes within our remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#D01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":744,"content":"<p>Sorry to interrupt Ms Carroll but when a dispute comes into us, that is one of the first things we would consider, that is, whether we have jurisdiction to deal with it or not.

That opportunity is there if someone wishes to test that and we certainly look at all of those cases in terms of our disputes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Walsh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":745,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p> <p>  In dealing with what change might be warranted and so on, we would welcome any clarity that would be provided in the legislation around this.  We would urge, however, one point of caution, which is to ensure that there is some kind of definition of student accommodation and what a student is underneath that in order that if we are going to give these landlords, which is right, an exemption from Part 4 rights, that is, the security of tenure one gets after six months for five and a half years, then we need to make sure that it is not abused.  To do that, we need to make sure that consideration is given fully to defining what a student accommodation is.  Otherwise we could have cases of people trying to say something is student accommodation in order to ensure somebody does not get security of tenure.  It is essential that thought and time are put into that element of it.  Those are the sorts of discussions we would have had with the Department to date on that particular issue.<\/p> <p>  On buy-to-let mortgages, we would have some questions on the legal basis of us trying to identify what is a buy-to-let mortgage.  I might bring in Ms Ward on this because we have a history, even in terms of the receivership side, of having difficulties around the conveyancing laws and of us being able to understand what is within our remit and what is not.

Somebody may say that it is a buy-to-let but we would not necessarily know if it was a principal private residence that somebody had let.  As we know, that, in itself, can pose problems.  Pre-2009, if someone wanted to let his or her principal private residence, he or she had to have written permission from the bank in order to do so.  That can cause difficulties for tenants as well.  It is an issue of clarity around that.  We would have to be careful how we word that.

The rent index has not come out but I wanted members with the details.  At a high level, what do the results look like?  Once again, rents continue to grow.  At a national level, rents grew at 7.1%.  That would compare to 6.4% in the last quarter.  We went from a rent of &euro;1,054, as the average national rent, to &euro;1,060. That is 7% above the peak, which is 7% higher than they have ever been.  Within the Dublin market, rent went up 7.8% on an annual basis from 5.1%.  This has taken rents in the Dublin area from &euro;1,417 to &euro;1,527.  That is 16% higher than they have ever been.<\/p> <p>  What do the figures tell us?  Affordability is still a significant issue within the market.  A growing economy, wage inflation and so on are all issues that are still contributing to the market.  I would like, however, to highlight that the quarterly figures are showing some moderation within the levels.  When we look nationally at what the rent inflation looks like on a quarterly basis, we went from 1.1% inflation in the last quarter to 0.4% inflation for this quarter.  Within the Dublin market, we went from 1.1% to 1%.  The growth rate on a quarterly basis, for two quarters now, has shown reductions.<\/p> <p>  The annual rate I just talked about is comparing what we looked like this year, and comparing it to last year.  The quarterly rate is what we need to look at in terms of where we might be going.  What I really need is a third quarter to enable us to say whether that moderation will continue and see its impact is on the overall annual rate.  Obviously, we would like to see moderation in a third quarter.  That would have been the best results we would have seen in years within the rental sector.  <\/p> <p>  As said earlier, until we get those exemptions registered with us, there is a little bit of the dark arts with what is going on.  <\/p> <p>  The other thing I would like to point out to the committee is the volatility that is still within that market.  Due to the restricted supply, what happens is that the rental sector might get a new development within a particular area and because there is such limited supply, the impact of this on the overall averages is massive.  If one looks at the Galway figures over the last number of quarters, they are going up 10% or down 10%.  Certain markets are very seasonal.  This goes to the underlying issue with the overall market.<\/p> <p>  This is just to give members a very quick summary.  I have concentrated more on Dublin, because it gives them an indication of the rent pressure zones and their impact, and on the national figure.  I am not sure how much more detail the committee may want.  The committee has these figures and I will be happy to speak on anything else the committee may wish to raise.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Casey's question, I have answered the issue of student accommodation, so I will discuss the deposit protection scheme.  The deposit protection scheme is already provided for within legislation.  The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is on record as saying we have concerns about it.  We have concerns about it going back to that kind of bureaucracy and about how easy it might be to implement.  One of the things within that legislation is that there has to be a cooling-off period before one gives back a deposit.  This would result in us giving back deposits at a slower level than the market currently does.  This could actually have a worse impact on tenants.  The legislation provides that if both parties do not agree to give back the deposit, then the whole issue has to go through our dispute resolution process in a different formal manner.  There are changes that could be made to that legislation to make it more effective.  We have provided a submission to the Department on that basis.  These proposals are probably necessary in order to make the scheme more effective.<\/p> <p>  The scale of what one is talking about here is huge for the RTB.  When I discussed this previously with the Minister, we talked about a two year change management plan.  That would come in at the end of it because it would give us the time to plan for resourcing.  That resourcing would be beyond just us resourcing and would probably have an outsourcing element to it as well with IT infrastructure, everything else that is needed, communication with landlords and so on.  One of the other changes we suggested is that it does not have retrospective impact.  If the legislation came in, everybody would come in on the same day and for us to manage that would be hugely difficult.  If it was brought in and applied to new tenancies in the first instance, we would be still be dealing with over &euro;100 million a year in transactions.  It is a huge scheme.

I mentioned the idea of smart regulation earlier because the organisation will grow but the question is by how much.  We are making significant investment in IT this year within the RTB.  Our IT infrastructure is an area for which we rightly have been criticised.  That is being designed on the basis of data analytics and being able to use data in a much more effective way.  We expect to be able to use our registration data in a much more effective way, that is, not just looking at the 20% but in terms of putting programmes in and using smart intelligence where the computer is telling one that one needs to look at a particular issue, for instance.  At the same time we will be able to have some people who will be able to monitor advertisements on platforms etc. to see where rents may be advertised above the rate at which we think they should be, based on other data we have within the information held by us.  We would be able to look at the exemptions data to specifically be able to have a quick look and to ask whether that sounds like it is in compliance with the legislation.<\/p> <p>  What we think is good about the sanctions model - and there is a lot of talk about criminality here - is that the sanctions model is a civil law-based approach.  That is really beneficial to the RTB because our non-registration of tenancies has always been a criminal matter up to now.  That means that if we go out to prosecute someone, we are not allowed to ask them anything that might incriminate them.  Our powers to get information are greatly limited by it being a criminal process.  There is somewhat of an irony there.<\/p> <p>  Within the sanctions regime there are two things that are really important.  We have the power to ask people specifically to give us details of their bank statements and to bring them in and question them about things which we could not do in a criminal case.  To revert to a lack of understanding, there are some landlords, a small minority, who are blatantly contravening the legislation.  There is another group who are getting it half right but do not always do so.  We can get to those people, they can admit  their contravention and we can work with them on that basis.  There is an element of proportionality that we can bring into this and we need to have that proportionality.  <\/p> <p>  When one looks at who comprises our landlord sector, 86% own between one and two properties.  I was asked a question at a different event yesterday about all of the institutional investment companies coming in and I went back to check the extent to which that stock type is growing.  We believe that this stock type is still only making up less than 3% of the overall size of the sector.  While it is growing, it is not significant in terms of the overall size of the sector.  We have to remember that we are operating with amateur landlords and I would like to bring them with us.  We want everyone to comply.  That is a little information as to how I think we may work on the investigations side.<\/p> <p>  In terms of areas outside of the rent pressure zones, RPZs, there is an element with every regulation that is brought in to the effect that one unintended consequence of regulating a market is that people will chase the market.  We have had this problem in areas like Limerick, initially, when it came in, because they were very near the national standard rent where we can point to the use of the information within this, where the local electoral areas, LEAs, are listed.  We can go to people and show that they are not that near, if one looks at such and such or that this is where the trends are going.  On a more local level we can help the committee do this if that is of any assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":757,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  My questions concern how the witnesses perceive the implementation of this legislation by the RTB, should it be progressed.<\/p> <p>  The first thing to say is that I have a couple of issues with the letter the Minister sent out to the committee.  I do not agree that there should be a 4% increase in the rent at all.  It is far above inflation, which is the reality and this was said at the time.  We should not just blithely accept that the rate should stay at what the other rate was, which was agreed a year and a half ago.  There is no justification for 4% rent increase and people are not necessarily getting wage increases of that order.  There is no excuse for heating the rented sector any more.<\/p> <p>  The issue I have is that the RTB's very good figures show that in Dublin, rent is about 50% higher than the national average, which I believe should be noted.  The increase that has taken place is almost double the 4% limit.  Why that is the case?  Presumably, a lot of those are new tenancies etc. but there is no question but that a lot of them are not.  Many landlords are driving a coach and horses through this legislation as it stands.  At the time of the legislation's passage, we tabled a series of amendments, one of which was similar in some ways to what is proposed, albeit not as strong, whereby a landlord would be obliged to produce a certificate of what the rent should be from the RTB.  Nobody who is queueing up with 50 other people to try to get a place to rent, particularly in Dublin and these rent pressure zones, is in any way strong enough to challenge a landlord about the rent that is being charged.  That is just the reality of it.  How is this going to change now?  It would be easier if the onus was on the landlord to produce a statement of what the rent should be.  The RTB say here that it will publish a list of rents for an area.  Will a prospective tenant, queueing up for a property in Rathmines or wherever, know what the rent rate is for Nos. 1 to 3 Oakview Lane or wherever it is?  It is only when we get down to the person renting having that power that we can keep the rents below a certain level.  <\/p> <p>  The other issue concerns the scenario when a complaint is received.  I note the RTB itself also can initiate a complaint, which is obviously good.  How serious must that complaint be?  Can the witnesses clarify that?  Would this involve a breach in rent or a breach in the other aspects of tenancy like the conditions etc.?  As it seems quite onerous, how would the investigation be conducted?  Will somebody from the RTB call up to the house and talk to the tenant or the landlord?  How serious does this have to be?  The reason I ask is that staffing would have to be dramatically increased.  <\/p> <p>  I also wanted to ask if any cases had been taken already under the Dublin RPZ legislation.  I know lots of people take cases to the RTB but how many cases has the RTB had for breaches of the rules so far?  While statutory powers have now been given to the RTB, it has existing powers if a landlord goes above the prescribed rent in an area.  Have many people have taken cases?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#F00800","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":758,"content":"<p>I have just a couple of supplementary questions.  Ms Carroll said in her initial response that she would favour the idea of the annual registration and would have concerns about a criminal offence if a landlord did not notify of a change, be it a rent,  tenancy change, etc.  Does she think that having an annual registration with a possible civil offence, if that is not complied with, would be the ideal model for all the reasons she has just outlined?  I would be interested in her view on that.<\/p> <p>  The approach outlined on the resource plan makes eminent sense.  It gives us a much more realistic sense of the kind of timelines here.  To pin Ms Carroll down on this, can she confirm that?  It is important for us when we pass legislation and when we tell people about it that we can be honest and say that this is not something that is going to be available necessarily in September or October and that we are looking at the first quarter of next year.  Is there a time scale around that?<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding the fact that there will not be a set number of additional staff until the resource plan is produced, is the RTB getting any indication from the Government or the Department that they will support that?  If there is an independent review, clearly the purpose of that is to give the best estimate of what is required.  If that is what that independent advice says, then clearly there is an onus on us all to support it.<\/p> <p>  On the rent pressure zones, Ms Carroll mentioned places like Limerick and Waterford.  We have asked on a number of occasions whether it is possible in those types of cases for the data to be looked at on an electoral division, ED, rather than on a local electoral area, LEA, basis, and not necessarily right across the country because I appreciate there might be a low level of rental properties at an ED level.  However, particularly in Waterford and Limerick cities, there has to be enough data at an electoral division level that one could look at some kind of rent pressure zones being in operation at that level.  I absolutely agree with Deputy Coppinger that the 4% over three years is 12.5%, but even if the people in Limerick and Waterford could get that basic level of protection, that would be something worth pursuing.<\/p> <p>  I also thought that what Ms Carroll said on purpose-built student accommodation was very interesting.  I will try to pin her down on it.  Is it Ms Carroll's view that purpose-built student accommodation, whether on or off campus, by universities or private sector interests, where a student has a nine month licence and has sole occupancy of that unit over those nine months, falls under the Residential Tenancies Act?  Will she be clear about it in that case because that is important for us?<\/p> <p>  On defining buy-to-lets, and Ms Ward's comments were very interesting, the Focus Ireland amendment specifically proposed a definition and it was precisely for the reasons she said.  Its reasons were that properties were purchased as buy-to-lets and not as principal private dwellings that were subsequently let out.  Does she believe that it is in or around that that we might find a solution to it or has she some other ideas?<\/p> <p>  On the index, I listened very carefully to what Ms Carroll said on the quarterly changes.  For example, the point at which rents started to increase dramatically was in the third quarter of 2013.  The annual increases start to hit 6%, then up to 8%, then up 11% and so on.  In the case of Dublin, if one looks at the quarterly increases, in each of the four years, 2014 to 2017, inclusive, there have always been at least two quarters where the quarterly increase is very low.  In 2014, there is -0.1%, and 1.8% in 2015 and 2016.  I am not convinced that the quarterly reading is telling us anything other than there is a dip in the first quarter, a jump in the second quarter, a dip again in the third quarter and a jump in the fourth quarter.  One could argue that in 2017 it moderates a bit but surely the really worrying thing is that the annual quarterly increase does not show any real sign of moderation in the sense that the last quarter was 5.1% for Dublin but it is now 7.8%.  I fully accept what was said that we do not have visibility regarding the properties with exemptions.  However, there would have to an awful lot of exemptions for what should be in and around 4% to hit a 7.8% annual increase.  Am I wrong about that?<\/p> <p>  What is also concerning me is that it is not just about exemptions.  I believe that many tenants have now forgotten that even before the rent pressure zones, there was a limited level of protection regarding the rate of increase on the current market levels.  I refer to my own constituency because I know it very well.  On the basis of the quarterly figures, the average rent in Clondalkin is &euro;1,500 per month.  One will not get anywhere in Clondalkin today for &euro;1,500 per month.  Rents range from &euro;1,800 to &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,200.  In all those cases, whether they are first-time tenancies or new tenancies, there is a breach of the pre-2016 rules as well as a breach of the 2016 rules in terms of rent requests way above the RTB's index of averages.  Is there a bit of work we could all do in trying to highlight the fact that even within a rent pressure zone, or even outside one, there is a level of increase that is unacceptable under the pre-2016 legislation?  There is no new supply in Clondalkin; it is all existing properties.  I do not believe a substantial number of renovations are going on.  What I am seeing are a lot of people breaking both sets of rules, the RPZ and the pre-RPZ rules.  My fear is that when one gets that visibility on the level of exemptions, it is still not going to account for the gap between what should be the 4% and, as Deputy Coppinger rightly pointed out in Dublin, what is really a doubling of that.  If the witness have any thoughts on all that, I would a really appreciate hearing them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#G00100","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":759,"content":"<p>I will be very quick.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin alluded to the fact there is absolute agreement among the Opposition that we want to see this in the Bill.

There is a definition under section 13(d) of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016.  That defines what purpose-built student accommodation is.

I am of the belief that further protections on deposits are needed.  The Oireachtas has passed that legislation.

If the RTB has not done that work, or if it does not have it back before we pass the Bill - the Minister wants it passed before the recess and I believe we are all in agreement to do our best to do that - I just want to make sure we do not have the cart before the horse and that the RTB is not left with the regulations and does not have the resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#G00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":760,"content":"<p>I am in agreement with the previous speakers.  My issue with the Minister over the past few months is that there are only 21 local authorities in the rent pressure zone areas.  That is a significant issue in that the amount neighbouring counties will be lower.  In my own county of Carlow, rents have increased from &euro;700 to &euro;1,000-&euro;1,100.  What is actually happening is that landlords are able to increase rents.  We have good landlords but on the other side, we have landlords who do not do work for their tenants and this is a major issue.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the extension of the notice to tenants in the Bill.  That is crucial.  On several occasions a landlord would just put it in writing but it is not a legal letter.  That lack of information is part of the awareness issue raised by the witnesses.  It has to be a legal letter to a tenant.  Tenants do not know that so when they receive a letter from a landlord, they think it is part of their notice to quit.  There are 325,000 tenancies registered with the RTB, which is a significant number.  However, tenants who come to me do not have the information to which they are entitled.<\/p><p>That is the biggest issue for them.  As other speakers have stated, staffing is a significant issue, although that is no fault of the witnesses.<\/p><p> A very important issue which I have dealt with in many recent cases is the role of the RTB in terms of local authorities.  Local authorities operate the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  However, in my area many tenants who are on the housing list and receiving a HAP payment are in non-regular accommodation in which the heating may not be working or there may be health and safety issues with the windows.  What is the role of the RTB in terms of councils and, in particular, in regard to the RAS, because those on the RAS are local authority tenants?  Do local authorities work with the RTB?  Is there an agreement with the RTB or with the landlord or tenant?  That must be clarified.  Many tenants are unaware of the situation in that regard and most are confused in terms of dealing with the local authorities.  Does the RTB have a protocol or plan in that regard?<\/p><p> I live in an area with two excellent third level colleges.  Lack of supply is the biggest issue facing everybody here today.  However, student accommodation is occupied by students for the nine months of the academic year but some landlords then take on tenants for the remaining three months of the year, after which those tenants must leave.  That is another problem, in particular in smaller towns such as my own where there is, as I said, two colleges.  What can we do for such tenants?  Can anything be done for students?  Are they only entitled to a nine month tenancy?  Can a person taken on a tenancy for three months?  Can a landlord state he or she will only take a tenant for three months and the tenant must vacate by the end of August because the student tenants return in September?  Those are issues which we need to address in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#G00300","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Apologies for the delay - I want to ensure I start with the right information.  Deputy Coppinger's first question was in regard to the 4% increase and whether that cap is too high.  On the Deputy's other comments and the fact that inflation is running at a far higher level than that, from the perspective of the RTB, getting it down to 4% would be an achievement because we are quite far from that level, as the Deputy stated.  I listened to a talk today from an academic who has recently studied the German market, which has a similar rental regulation regime to that in Ireland.  There are still very high increases in Germany in spite of it having a regulatory framework that largely mirrors ours.  The academic's take on the situation is very similar to my own, namely, that regulation must be accompanied by enforcement.  The Bill before the committee provides for such enforcement.  In Germany, as in Ireland, one piece was put in place but the enforcement to underpin it was not brought in.<\/p> <p>  I agree that there are issues in terms of us not understanding the exemptions.  My point in referring to the exemptions is that I would like to be able to show the index without it and thus get a better picture of the inflation.  I do not suggest that there is no inflation.  There are contraventions but I cannot ascertain the volume thereof until I get data on the exemptions.  There is much non-compliance in the German market in terms of people ignoring the regulations.  We need to bring in enforcement.  A positive aspect of the enforcement is that we will publish any sanctions, which will empower tenants to make a complaint to us, although not necessarily through our dispute mechanism.  Tenants will also be protected by being able to make an anonymous complaint.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger asked how those investigations can be undertaken.  Many tenants within the current structure access our dispute resolution service, which is entirely focused on two parties bringing evidence before us.  That is a difficult step for tenants to taken in a restricted supply market in which landlords clearly have the upper hand.  As such, tenants are not coming forward to the extent that would be expected in view of the evidence of contraventions in the market.  It is very important for tenants to be able to come to us anonymously and that must be safeguarded as the legislation is progressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":763,"content":"<p>Have people come forward since the legislation was originally enacted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#H00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":764,"content":"<p>I currently have no power to do anything with complaints.

In 2016, 255 cases on the issue of rent reviews and whether they were legal were taken with the RTB.  That may primarily concern rent pressure zones but it could be in regard to the rent certainty legislation brought in by the 2015 legislation.  For example, a landlord may have conducted a rent review before being entitled to do so or may not have given the required notice.  In such complaints, there are usually several breaches rather than only one.

There is protection in the Act against a person maliciously evicting a tenant for taking a dispute.  More cases are being brought under section 56 of the Act and more damages are being awarded to tenants.  However, the reality is that tenants still feel their home may be at risk.  It is to be hoped that the new legislation will stop that but for the moment it can be difficult for some people to make that complaint and I do not wish to understate the scale of that difficulty.<\/p> <p>  On certificates of rent, I have read some of the committee debates on this issue and am unsure exactly how it is proposed to work.  In order that members understand our current registration data work, a landlord is currently required to register every new tenancy or every further part 4 with us.  That is why I believe there may be a slight weakness in what is proposed.  If a tenant has been in a tenancy for over six years, it must be re-registered or else it is a new tenancy.  It is only at that point that I get data.  If I were to tomorrow publish all the rental information I have on existing tenancies, it would probably be misleading because it would not be dated.  Even if I put a date on it, that might be 2014 or 2015 and the rent may have been reviewed twice since then.  There is a difficulty in that regard.  I do not currently have the data to identify the current certified rent for a property.  We need to bring in annual registration such that I can identify the rents that have been registered every year since that point and identify the date of the last rent review.  We do not currently have those data and I could not, therefore, give the committee any intelligence on what is going on in the existing rental market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":769,"content":"<p>That being the case, how can this legislation be implemented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#H00900","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":770,"content":"<p>It is a journey towards transparency but that transparency will need to be strengthened.  The Minister has told us and also openly stated that he is committed to introducing annual registration and he is continuing to work on that.  It is an important piece of the puzzle.  I do not wish to get technical with the committee but the Bill contains an amendment to section 139 of the current legislation, which would place an onus on landlords to come forward and tell us about every rent review, as I stated.  That will be difficult to enforce because of the difficulty in determining who to go after.  How will I know if a landlord has done a rent review?  That could involve me writing to every landlord every year to ask them to confirm it, which would cost &euro;174,000.<\/p><p>Given the scale and diversity of our sector, trying to regulate that will not be as effective as it could be.  I would caution about that.  I believe a more programmed smarter form of regulation will allow for more effective regulation.<br\/><br\/>The strength of what is before us is the fact that we publish every sanction that comes out.  While resources represent an element of this, I hope after a year of the Residential Tenancies Board carrying out investigations and publishing all these sanctions, it will start to change behaviour within the market.  Seeing that the sanctions are working - on the tenant and landlord sides - will start an empowerment and will also ensure more caution on the part of those not in compliance with the legislation currently.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked how serious a complaint needs to be in order for us to take it.  On the basis of the heads of the Bill, my understanding is that anything can be said to us and we can investigate it.  The only exception is malicious complaints and I do not expect to get too many of those.  The idea is that somebody can make a complaint either anonymously or by giving their name.  At the moment, while I cannot do anything with them, I get former tenants writing to me because they have seen their past property advertised at a rate beforehand.  I expect to be able to use that much more effectively in future.  All I need is something to prompt an investigation.  Then I can ask the landlord directly and look for the supporting evidence of the rent they are receiving by way of bank statements and so on.  It should be quite an effective means and will not be a system based on tenants coming forward with evidence.  Somebody will be able to come forward and say, &quot;I think there's a problem here in relation this and this is why.&quot;  We can have a quick look at it and start an investigation if we feel there is non-compliance.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy also asked what can be contravened.  The heads before the committee propose two contraventions in the schedule.  One of them relates to rent pressure zones.  That could be the exemptions or the 4% increase.  The second piece, which is important for us, relates to non-registration of tenancies.  As I mentioned earlier, if a tenancy has not been registered we have to pursue the criminal route, which is very difficult for us and it means our investigations are quite limited.  Hopefully we will be able to use the civil-sanctions model provided that the legislation is passed.  Those are the two contraventions specified in the heads at the moment.<br\/><br\/>I think that dealt with most of Deputy Coppinger's questions.<br\/><br\/>Both Deputies Coppinger and &Oacute; Broin commented on the quarterly changes.  I agree that the market is not stable.  Things increase and reduce followed by further increases and reductions.  If I could see a third quarter of moderation that would be the first time we would have seen three quarters of moderation.  The next quarter's figures will give us a sense of whether the trend is continuing.  That is important for us to look at.  We are seeing dips - things go up and things go down.  It is the dark arts at the moment.  It is important for us even to get a scale.  If I could get those exemptions out of there, I would be able to point to clear non-compliance.  I would expect to see a good annual rate on a consistent basis at about 5% under the rent pressure zone legislation.  I say 5% because not everybody will complete a review every two years.  There will be a <i>pro rata<\/i>catch up for some people.  That means it may always be a little bit ahead of the 4%.  However, we should see it at around that level.  We would obviously like to see it stabilise and have a dampening effect.  We need to remember that the overall impact of this was not just on the individual rents; it was to have a dampening effect on the overall market so that by some rents being reduced, even the new rents overall would get reduced.  We need to see it start working more effectively.  I agree with the Deputy on that.<br\/><br\/>At the moment purpose-built student accommodation publicly funded by the Higher Education Authority is specifically excluded from our legislation.  Anything that a public body has, whether it is the HSE or us, does not come within the remit of the RTB.  When I talk about what might be within our remit at the moment, I am talking about privately built student accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#H01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":772,"content":"<p>Are universities covered by that exemption?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#J00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":773,"content":"<p>Exactly, educational facilities.<\/p> <p>  Just to come to the deposit protection scheme-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rosalind Carroll"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":774,"content":"<p>Ms Carroll's point is that the private purpose-built student accommodation is covered under the RTA and RPZs.

The last time I checked - I am open to correction - we did not have cases before us on it.  We could not comment specifically on an individual case if we did.  I think that deals with Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions.<\/p> <p>  On deposit protection and the idea of mydeposits and other UK-based models being used, within the current legislative framework we could not use those because it has to be the RTB that does that.  Therefore there is not a basis for providing that flexibility within the current legislation.  In addition we have no ability to have treasury management within the current legislation.  That means that all the money that comes in has to sit in a bank account and only be used for that purpose.  It cannot be used to help fund the scheme.  That is why I say there are small things that could be done to help use it.  That could even be used for the benefit of housing in a broader sense, for example, managed by the Housing Finance Agency and so on.  We could do certain things to improve the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others asked when we could implement this.  There is no way we could implement the sanctions before the first quarter.  That is to ensure we have the right framework around it and also have the right resourcing and trained staff who are skilled in what they are doing.  It is important for both tenants and landlords, and we want to ensure it is done correctly.  I do not think it could be done before quarter 1.  That does not mean the legislation could not proceed to be passed.  I need certainty in what I will be providing.  Until legislation is in place, it is very difficult for me to know what will be in the final legislation.  In the interim we are doing things such as commissioning the workforce plan on the basis that hopefully the legislation will be there.  We are not doing nothing in between.

We had many registrations for student accommodation.  Students brought cases to us.  Over the years as a different model of student accommodation was being built and provided, things started to change.<\/p><p>Perhaps landlords entered into different agreements with the individuals but the view could be that it is an apartment.  It may be that it is a three or four-bedroom apartment, but it is one tenancy with three or four people in it.  If people take cases to us through our disputes resolution procedure, we would look for that agreement, not the title deeds, and look at the substance of that agreement and how it works in practice.  While somebody may say that he or she is going to move an individual on the first of every month, the question is whether he or she does that in practice.  If not, then it is a bad term within that tenancy agreement.  This is why we would encourage cases to come before us.<\/p><p> Wearing the registration enforcement hat, again we are looking at providers of student accommodation and seeking to find out why they are not registering.  When they say they do not have to register because it is a licence agreement, we do the same with these as we would do with every other landlord who says it is not a tenancy but rather it is a licence.  We ask them for a copy of the licence.  In that way we can then look through that and if we are of a belief that it is not a licence, we engage with them on the grounds that it should be registered.<\/p><p> I would not come from a background of thinking that they are just licences, but with all of the confusion around it and the new models of student accommodation that are being provided, it is a question of having the correct definition in legislation.  We would have to look at the definition that Deputy O'Brien was talking about and see whether it suits the purpose.<\/p><p> As regards student accommodation, Senator Murnane O'Connor spoke about somebody only getting a nine-month lease, but it depends on what people sign up to.  If they sign up to a nine-month lease, it is a nine-month lease.  The one thing to remember with student accommodation is that it generally suits students to get the nine-month lease because then they are off for the summer.  What happens then is that the individual comes back the next year and the only provision that does not apply to students is security of tenure.  This means that after a student has done three or four years in college and has got a job with Ericsson or whoever, he or she cannot stay on in that accommodation because we would end up again with very little student accommodation being available.  The only difference between student accommodation and regular tenancies is that a person does not have that Part IV right to stay on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Kathryn Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":780,"content":"<p>Senator Murnane O'Connor is correct where she talks about information and awareness.

It is a distinct pleasure to be here.  I am the UN special rapporteur on the right to housing.  I was appointed in 2014 by the UN Human Rights Council to serve as a global monitor on housing conditions and state obligations in this regard.  I am visiting Ireland on an academic visit, not an official mission, so I am not here to assess the implementation of the right to housing in your domestic context.  Instead, I hope I might be able to offer a useful point of view based on my work and experience in light of Ireland's not insignificant housing issues.  In my short time here, I have learned homelessness is on the increase - up an alarming 27%, at least, in the last year - there is paucity of social housing, and large financial actors that are profit driven are playing a dominant role in the housing market.  At the same time, the Parliament recently voted down the inclusion of the right to housing as an enumerated right in the Constitution.  The right to housing is not included in Rebuilding Ireland.  Ireland has a reservation on housing rights provisions in the European Social Charter and it has yet to ratify the optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.<\/p> <p>  When I am confronted with housing situations like these, I am concerned that a state's international human rights obligations may not be met or engaged and that commitments made with respect to housing under the sustainable development goals will not be achieved.  As members may know, target 11.1 of goal 11 of the sustainable development goals commits states to ensuring access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services by 2030, which also means ending homelessness within this timeframe.<\/p> <p>  The best way forward for Ireland to address the housing crisis and meet its international human rights commitments and obligations is to adopt a human rights-based housing strategy or a national action plan that recognises and implements housing as a human right.  Why are human rights so essential to housing strategies?  Homelessness and grossly inadequate or unaffordable housing are an assault on dignity and life and go to the heart of what triggers, or what should trigger, human rights concern.  Human rights violations of this nature demand human rights responses.  Human rights demand that governments interact with people who are homeless and inadequately housed as rights holders empowered to engage and be involved in decisions affecting their lives.  A rights-based approach clarifies who is accountable to whom: all levels of government are accountable to people, particularly marginalised and vulnerable groups.  Human rights incorporate universal norms that bring coherence and co-ordination to multiple areas of law and policy through a common purpose and a shared set of values.  <\/p> <p>  My most recent report focuses on the core principles that should inform a human-rights-based housing strategy.  Let me describe a few of them.  First, housing strategies must be based in law and affirm the right to housing as a legal right.<\/p><p>This does not necessarily mean constitutional provisions, although it could.  Equally, it could be a legislated right to housing, such as measures enshrined in some other jurisdictions.  Strategies must prioritise those most in need and must make an absolute priority of eliminating homelessness and addressing the needs of those in the most desperate circumstances.  Strategies must adopt a comprehensive and whole-of-government approach.  They must co-ordinate and guide the work of multiple Departments or Ministries, as well as multiple layers of government.  Strategies must ensure accountable budgeting and tax justice as a means for states to discourage speculation and encourage affordable housing.  Strategies must put in place independent institutional mechanisms to monitor progress and hold Governments accountable to goals and timelines.  They must also ensure access to justice, including access to hearings and remedies for violations.  Finally, strategies must clarify the obligations of private actors.  The obligation to realise the right to housing lies with states and cannot be delegated to private actors.  Housing strategies will not be effective if they fail to engage the dominant role played by financial markets and investors.  Strategies must include robust measures to reorient private investment and development to ensure inclusive cities and affordable housing.<\/p><p> I encourage the committee to take bold and swift measures to urgently address homelessness as an egregious human rights violation.  It is no different from any other violation of the right to life and the security of the person.  In my short time here I saw and spoke with too many people living in deep hardship.  I know Ireland can do better than this, and it must.  I would be happy to answer any questions committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Leilani Farha","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":790,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting us to speak today.  I will explain a little about the Mercy Law Resource Centre, MLRC.  It is an independent law centre that provides free legal aid and advice to people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.  We also seek to advocate changes in policies and laws that unduly and adversely affect people living on the margins of society.<br\/><br\/>We provide five key services: free legal advice clinics; legal representation in the areas of housing and social welfare law; legal support and training to organisations working in the field of homelessness; policy work; and a befriending service.<br\/><br\/>I wish to discuss the Second Right to Housing Report: The Right to Housing in Comparative Perspective.  I have given a copy of the report to the committee for distribution.  The report is a comparative perspective on the right to housing through consideration of the legal systems of Finland, Scotland, France and South Africa.  A wide variety of structural and institutional means are applied by which the right can be guaranteed.  There is no one-size-fits-all model.  The right to housing does not necessarily equate to a significantly increased constitutional role of the Judiciary.  While not a panacea, a legally enforceable right to housing provides a valuable floor of protection.  The jurisdictions highlighted in this report show that the effectiveness of the right to housing relies heavily on the existence of fundamental and enduring political will and the allocation of resources.<br\/><br\/>A right to housing in the Constitution would not mean the right to a key to a home for all.  A constitutional right to housing would, however, put in place a basic floor of protection.  It would require the State in its decisions and policies to protect the right to housing in balance with other rights and to progressively realise the right to housing.<br\/><br\/>The report considers the position in Finland.  Finland's homeless figures have been decreasing for the past eight years.  It is a national priority there.  They also have a housing first strategy coupled with a constitutional right to housing.  Finland has adopted a form of constitutionalism whereby the democratically elected Legislature and an independent Judiciary are entrusted with a shared duty to protect constitutional rights.  There is a combination of <i>ex ante<\/i>review by a constitutional law committee of the parliament, as well as a limited form of post-judicial review.  The work of the committee is to scrutinise proposed legislation to ensure it results in the better implementation of socio-economic constitutional rights.<br\/><br\/>The report considers the position in Scotland.  Scotland has the broadest legal protection for those who are homeless and at risk of homelessness.  The protection is regarded as one of the strongest in the world.  Scotland's statutory right to housing makes local authorities responsible for the long-term rehousing of homeless people and has an interim duty to provide temporary accommodation in emergency situations.  Scotland also has a broad definition of those who are homeless.  It also has an order that limits the use of bed and breakfast accommodation as emergency accommodation to seven days for families.  The limit was reduced this year from 14 days to seven days.  There is currently no limit for the use of bed and breakfast accommodation in Ireland.  We regularly meet families who have been in bed and breakfast accommodation for two and a half years before they are appropriately socially housed.  Scotland has statutory provisions to prevent homelessness.  There is a duty on all registered social landlords, private landlords and creditors to notify the relevant local authority when proceedings are raised for the possession of a dwelling house.  This may allow the local authority to respond on an individual basis to prevent homelessness occurring.  The report from the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive published last week indicates that 48% of families who present as homeless in Ireland are coming from a notice to terminate.  In other words, that is the cause of 48% of families becoming homeless.  Under Scotland's model, all landlords have to notify the local authority, which may take action to prevent homelessness.  That is a strong safeguard.<br\/><br\/>France has a statutory right to housing known as the <i>droit au logement<\/i>, DALO, legislation of 2007.  This involved a complete overhaul of the French system.  The right to decent independent housing is guaranteed by the French state to all people who reside in France.  It is exercised through mediation and, if necessary, through an adversarial process.  This is patterned after the Scottish model and includes both an entitlement to emergency shelter and a legal cause of action for individuals who have been denied the right to secure long-term housing, thereby helping to ensure security of tenure and accessibility.  Protection is given to those who have a priority of need.  If the priority of need is met, the qualifying person may file a petition with a local housing mediation committee for urgent rehousing.  This committee comprises state representatives, local county and municipal representatives, representatives of social housing organisations, as well as individuals from tenant rights organisations.  The committee refer matters to a local authority prefect, who must then find suitable social housing for the applicant within a time period &ndash; usually three months.  The decision can be judicially reviewed and enforced.<br\/><br\/>South Africa has a constitutional right to housing.  It demonstrates that the right to housing is subject to trial in a court of law.  It offers a legal floor of protection.  However, it does not relatively alter the balance of power between decisions concerning the allocation of public moneys and resources.  I recognise this is a concern in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The right to housing is recognised in Europe in the constitutions of Belgium, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.  It is recognised in the legislation of Austria, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom.  Across the world the right to housing is included in 81 constitutions.  The right to adequate housing is provided for in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the European Social Charter.<br\/><br\/>As an economic and social right in accordance with international human rights, the State's obligation would be to progressively realise the right to the maximum extent of its available resources.  The most important definition of the right to housing is the obligation of the State to progressively realise the right to housing to the maximum extent of its available resources and to do this by all appropriate means, including the adoption of legislative measures.<br\/><br\/>How would the right to housing alleviate the crisis in homelessness?  All legislation and policy would have to be proofed to ensure reasonable protection of the right to housing in the same way as other rights are protected.  If the State decided to cut funding for hostels for people who are homeless, such a move could be challenged as a breach.  The failure of rent supplement and housing assistance payments to meet market rent could be challenged as a breach of the right to housing.  The fact that there is no legal aid for those facing evictions in Ireland could be challenged as a breach of the right to housing.  More important, a right to housing would require the State, in its decisions and policies, to protect the right to housing in balance with other rights.  This would mean that the courts would look at State decisions or policy as to whether they were proportionate by reference to the right.  It would mean the Government, in its stated policies and actions, would be obliged to respect the right.<\/p><p>As shown clearly in our last three High Court cases, there is no right to housing in Irish law nor is there a right to shelter.  One has no clear legal right to rely on.  The fundamental failure by the State to provide adequate emergency accommodation to a family with young children cannot be challenged directly in the courts.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today and for the attention that members have given us here.

Ms Farha has been exceptionally busy during the two short days that she has spent in this country and we have followed her interventions.  It is a pity that she is not here on an official visit to assess our implementation, or non-implementation, of the right to housing because the picture might be a little more bleak than her opening remarks suggest.<\/p> <p>  I compliment the Mercy Law Resource Centre on the work that it does and I say so not to be polite.  The centre makes a huge difference to the lives of a very significant number of people.  For the benefit of people who do not know the organisation, it must be one of the smallest housing non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in the country, and the only one that has a legal basis, yet it punches way above its weight.  <\/p> <p>  In 2014, the Citizens' Assembly voted by an overwhelming majority of 88% to have the right to housing enshrined in the Constitution.  Therefore, I believe that all of our conversations on housing must start from that point.  The Government set up the Citizens' Assembly with the aim of asking citizens for their views.  The vote on housing was the single largest vote in terms of the deliberations on socio-economic rights.  Many of us were members of the D&aacute;il Select Committee on Housing and Homelessness, which met before the current Government came into office.  While we could not get agreement between the parties over calling for a constitutional right to housing, although many of us argued for it, the committee made a clear recommendation that the current Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government should explore the issue.  In fact, the Government included the proposal in its Programme for Government.  Our problem is that the responsibility has been taken away from us.  Last year, the D&aacute;il voted against the wishes of a minority of us and transferred the responsibility from the housing committee, where it belongs, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  To me, the idea that such a committee could have the lead responsibility in deliberations on socio-economic issues clearly shows that the parties that voted for that resolution thought that the matter should, first and foremost, be based on cost implications.  I do not want to turn this matter into a political football.  All I will say is that I urge all of the parties to reconsider those arguments and to see whether we could bring the matter back to this committee, even to work in parallel with the finance committee, so that we can consider the housing policy implications of this important issue. <\/p> <p>  I have a few questions for Ms Farha.  Many of us here are not as conversant with international human rights law as Ms Farha.  Can she tell us what international human rights obligations Ireland has and how they should impact on our debate on this particular issue?  <\/p> <p>  Sometimes we spend too much time talking about the negative aspects.  Can Ms Farha, from her international experience, give us as much information as possible in the short time available about what works in other jurisdictions?   Such information will give a sense of the positive examples of best practice that we might seek to apply here.  <\/p> <p>  Many of us attended the launch of the MLRC's report that took place a month ago.  It is a very good report that sets out different options.  Can the witnesses, as front-line human rights defenders of housing rights, tell us their preferred option?  What is the best way that this State could protect and vindicate the right to housing?  Crucially, how do we fix the gap between having a constitutional right, which in and of itself is important, realised in Government policy and having legal vindication?  I do not want to put the witnesses on the spot but please give me a straight answer to the following.  Do they believe the Government's housing policy is human rights compliant, in terms of their understanding of the right to housing? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#CC00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Farha for her presentation.

Recently I was appointed the housing spokesperson for my own party so I have looked at this matter with fresh eyes.  Homelessness and housing is the biggest single challenge for this country and it is the biggest single blight on the State.  Thankfully, everyone wants to resolve the matter.  The idea that the finance committee would have total control over the matter and view it purely on the basis of the potential cost implications is not something that should continue.  I personally believe that aspect should be reconsidered.  I am particularly interested in the Scottish model.  However, I do not rule out the constitutional option by way of a change to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann or a legislative change.  I am also interested in hearing Ms Farha's preferred option.  Clearly, she prefers a constitutional change.

There has been a call for a whole-of-government approach and for housing-proofed legislation, particularly in terms of homelessness and suitable supports.

This morning, I attended a presentation on the pre-budget submission by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The submission states that in Ireland as many as 780,000 people live below the poverty line, 85,799 households are in need of social housing and almost 10,000 people are homeless.  I have been an elected representative for two years and I have witnessed the widening gap between some of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  When it comes to housing and homelessness we are in an emergency situation or a real crisis yet the Government has not recognised this.  Occasionally, we have heard the Government use the word \"crisis\" but we have never heard it say the word \"emergency\".  Even though there is emergency accommodation all over the country there has been no action whatsoever.  In this country there is no right to housing for those who really need it.  People have had to remain in emergency accommodation for more than years, which is an abuse of human rights.  Such a situation shows disrespect for the dignity of those who must live in these horrific circumstances.  I wanted to state on record that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has made a pre-budget submission and I hope that the Government will listen to the society.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions for the MLRC delegation.  Ms Kerin has talked about South Africa and uttered the sentence: \"A legally enforceable right to housing provides a valuable floor of protection.\"  To me, her use of the term \"floor of protection\" was unfortunate because we seek a legal roof of protection.  Sadly, we are on the floor.  In fact, we are on the ground and below the surface.  <\/p> <p>  Earlier Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked the witnesses to outline what works best, in terms of policy.

I will respond first to Deputy O'Brien's question around a constitutional versus legislative approach and a constitutional and legislative approach.  When I hear that a State is in the midst of making constitutional amendments, or is at least open to constitutional amendments, and it does not currently have the right to housing in its Constitution, my first response is that it should go for it.  More than 80 countries around the world have constitutional protections around the right to housing.  Members are correct that many of those nations do not implement that right but they have it.  I have worked for many years with people on low incomes and living in housing disadvantage and homelessness and I know how meaningful it is for people to have that constitutional right.  It changes their relationship with the world in which they live.  They feel validated and recognised as human beings and part of the human family.  Human rights is about bringing us all together as a human family and recognising that we are all but humans.  My advice, therefore, is to go for it constitutionally.  Government worries are generally unfounded.  Mercy Law has provided, and could provide even more, evidence that having a constitutionally enshrined right to housing is not the beast and the burden that some believe it to be.  If I was in the Legislature I would be proud to support the idea of contributing to people's human rights.<\/p> <p>  On legislation, in my own country, Canada, I have been advocating for the right to adequate housing for many years.  Canada is currently engaged in a process of adopting a national housing strategy based on human rights.  Under the current Government, constitutional provision on the right to housing is off the books.  It will not happen and so we have shifted our attention to a legislative approach.  There is some merit in this approach.  I do not know enough about Ireland and how this would work here but I am sure Mercy Law could, if it has not already done so, turn people's mind to instruct how this could be powerful, albeit not constitutional.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of best practice, I would not go much further afield than the examples chosen in the report.  Finland always comes out on top, particularly in the European context, because it is the only country that has reduced homelessness in the last two years.  I work very closely with the Government of Finland because it supports my mandate, not in terms of resources, but politically.  There is no doubt Finland is genuinely committed to addressing homelessness and inadequate housing.  It has a broad understanding of what constitutes homelessness in that it considers anyone living in an institution to be homeless.  Finland understands this in a deep way.  Its first kick at the can to try to eliminate homelessness was, to its mind, unsuccessful in that while it did reduce homelessness it did not meet its target in this regard.  It then decided to take another kick at the can.  In doing so, it looked at the structural causes of homelessness and then set about developing policies and programmes that go deeply into those structural causes.  In the last year, it has been quite successful, which shows its commitment.  A constitutionally entrenched right to housing is part of its culture.  One builds human rights culture through law and practice symbiotically.  In terms of the other end of the spectrum I, too, would point to South Africa.  The commonality with the case studies presented in the report before us today and my examples is a legally entrenched right to housing.  This is where one will find the most success at both ends of the spectrum.  South Africa has not ended homelessness and it is in a lot of trouble but it has made huge strides such that shack dwellers count on the constitutional right.  <\/p> <p>  On Ireland's international human rights obligations, we talk about the progressive realisation of the right to adequate housing, which is the standard.  Article 2 of the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights states that the right is to be progressively realised but not all aspects of the right are progressive.  Under international human rights law it is understood that States do have immediate obligations.  For example, there is an immediate obligation to address discrimination in housing.  There is also an immediate obligation to address homelessness.  The progressive realisation element does not kick in with homelessness at the first instance.  In other words, states must act immediately, urgently and aggressively to address homelessness because there is a thin line between living homeless and dying.  Human rights are supposed to protect us from this and so there is that immediate and urgent obligation.<\/p> <p>  With respect to what is stated under international human rights law in terms of what is adequate housing, there is a definition in an instrument called the General Comment No. 4, which lays out seven characteristics, two of which I will focus on now.  The first is affordability.  Affordability must be measured on the household income of the person or family.  It is not based on what the market can bear or is charging.  Rather, it is based on one's ability to pay, which makes sense.  What is affordable to a household is what they can afford and not what the market can bear.  The idea that affordability would be 80% of market value, which is used in many developed countries, would be inconsistent with international human rights norms.  The second key characteristic of adequate housing is security of tenure, which I believe is important in the context of Ireland.  As I said I have not been here long enough to really understand the situation here.  I am aware that some of the new legislative provisions introduced have made things a little better but I understand from anecdotal information I received and from some of the reports I looked at, that there is still a security of tenure problem.  We know why security of tenure is important.  The worry and anxiety created by a lack of security of tenure can be crippling and debilitating.  Also, the worry of losing one's home can cause all sorts of health and employment related problems.  Yesterday evening I heard a young gentleman talking about how he and his wife had just had a baby, lost their home, were living in adequate housing that is overcrowded and facing homelessness.  Is this what we want for our young families?  Obviously not.  None of us would wish that on anyone.  I also met a woman in her late 50s who owing to insecure tenure had been bounced around and ended up homeless at age 57.  She has some health issues that she cannot deal with when she is homeless and was recently given bedsit type accommodation.  This is not acceptable for people in later stages of life.  This women also does not have many family.  When one is homeless one cannot deal with any crisis that emerges.  Security of tenure is a cornerstone to the right to housing, for obvious reasons. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Leilani Farha"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":799,"content":"<p>To us, the system is broken.  A successful day for me is a day on which I get emergency accommodation for a family that has been previously refused it.<\/p><p>Every second week, families that are homeless and that have been denied access to emergency accommodation for myriad reasons present to me.  Last year, we went to a full decision at the High Court on three occasions.  We were in the High Court nine times last year trying to compel local authorities to provide emergency accommodation to families.  One of those families was staying in a tent outside the council building.  I went down to see it.  The three families in question were denied access to emergency accommodation and that was upheld by the courts because there is no right to emergency accommodation in Ireland, full stop.  As a result, the courts cannot compel local authorities to provide emergency accommodation.  This, to us, is grievous.  If that is a civilised society, we need a rethink.  That is our bottom line.  Families are presenting that have lived in bedrooms with perhaps five children for two and half years, so there is a long-term detrimental effect on children and parents.  They will be suing the State in ten or 15 years' time, and I hope they will do so.<\/p><p> In the meantime, we can look quickly at either Scotland or, ideally, Finland.  Ireland loves the Constitution.  Constitutional protection would prioritise the issue, show the Government leading and show that it is a national priority.  However, this must be backed up with investment.  Without allocation of resources, constitutional protection would only provide a basic floor of protection, by which I mean access to emergency accommodation only.  We do not want to waste Government money and our own time going to the High Court looking for emergency accommodation.  If there were a right to housing, there would be an obligation on local authorities to provide emergency accommodation.  The word \"shall\" must be used.  At present, provision is optional, is made when \"reasonable\" and is subject to the opinion of the council.  In Scotland, the use of bed and breakfast accommodation is limited and has been reduced this year alone from 14 days to seven days.  We have no limit, so there is no end to how long our families stay in bed and breakfast accommodation.  They are staying there for two and a half years.  How long will they have to stay in hubs?  There is no definition or limit, and that is our concern.  Finland and Scotland have both implemented a limit, and this can be judicially reviewed.  As a result, if the State went over the limit - let us say, three months in Scotland - we could judicially review it and enforce that right to appropriate housing, not bed and breakfast accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sinead Kerin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I am sorry.

It does not include people who are sofa-surfing, families moving between friends' homes, thousands of women and children staying in domestic violence refuges or people living on the streets.  We do not know, therefore, what the real problem is because we are not counting it.  Unless we take responsibility and get to grips with the situation, we will not be able to come up with the solutions.  Many other countries around the world are improving in this regard.  Finland's national priority is to reduce homelessness, and it has done so.  It has now reduced it to 7,000, and only 214 families are homeless in Finland today.

It was a general question thrown at us as to whether the current system in Ireland is compliant in terms of human rights.  It certainly is not, particularly in view of the clients we deal with and the nature of the issue of local authorities unfortunately refusing people even emergency accommodation and putting them at risk of rough sleeping, bringing children into cars and sleeping in their cars, which we have come across among our client base.  Clearly, we are not compliant.  Taking the entire system across the board, it is not compliant with international standards or the right to shelter and housing across the world.<br\/><br\/>What has happened to our system?  What has happened to a country that had a good record of provision of social housing in times when the State did not have a lot of finances?  We have created a system whereby we have become deeply reliant on the private sector without real regulation or real control of what is happening in it.  As a State, we seem to be haunted by the ghost of Blake <i>v<\/i>. Attorney General, a case in the 1980s in which rent controls were found unconstitutional and any interference with private property in any way would seem to have been found unconstitutional.  The two previous items of housing legislation that went through these Houses in recent years, the 2009 and 2014 Acts, have created a situation whereby local authorities, which have traditionally had a responsibility in respect of housing and in many cases performed it quite well, have been effectively disempowered, have in some cases welcomed that disempowerment and are now losing a kind of institutional ability to be housing authorities.<br\/><br\/>HAP was specifically mentioned.  HAP is an absolute disaster on a number of levels.  We have created a system of social housing assistance in Ireland whereby we are actually creating discrimination within the system.  There is discrimination between a HAP applicant, a HAP tenant, a local authority tenant proper, shall we say, and other tenants and housing support receivers.  This discrimination in itself is creating a problem.  People on the payment lose their HAP supports if they go &euro;1,000 above their income limit.  Local authority tenants can go well above their income limits and their rents are assessed proportionally compared to their incomes, making it ultimately uneconomic, perhaps, for them to stay in their houses, move into the private sector or whatever.  We are creating a system of injustices in various forms of social housing support and for tenants across that sector, and it is an issue that will be litigated on because it has been litigated on in other countries.  I was speaking briefly earlier to my colleague from Canada.  There is a well known case in Canada, the Sparks case, which looked at the inequalities across various housing supports.  This will ultimately, unfortunately, end up in court.  HAP is a disaster for two reasons.  It took away from the local authority - the housing authority under our legislation - a responsibility to secure tenancies.  It has placed an obligation on disadvantaged families in many respects and put them at the mercy of the private market without regulation and without protection.<br\/><br\/>One does not have to look too far back for a comparison.  I refer to section 24 of the 2009 Act and what is known as RAS.  There may on paper seem to be very little difference between RAS and HAP, but with RAS the responsibility remains with the local authority to secure and find tenancies and to ensure that applicants who are assessed and are qualified are placed in those tenancies.  Perhaps this could be revisited.  The other problem with HAP is, as I said, that it has taken away from local authorities their responsibility and taken away the institutional experience of managing and providing housing, which, when lost, takes a long time to rebuild, and then we create a situation whereby we are dealing with homelessness and people without shelter for the next number of years.<br\/><br\/>Another real answer - and it may seem as though we failed on this in the past - is house-building and direct provision by housing authorities.  Under our legislation, local authorities are housing authorities.  They have a responsibility for direct provision of housing and they need to get back to directly providing.  I know from my work as a lawyer and from my colleagues that there is a level of discrimination and prejudice towards people who are social housing tenants in this country.  Through my own background and my experience working with Travellers over the years, I have felt the discrimination and prejudice towards the Traveller community.  We now have the same level of discrimination and prejudice towards social housing applicants on the basis that somehow they are pariahs and parasites on the State, that they are looking for something for nothing.  Social housing is not free.  It is not free to the tenant who lives in it, who may be working, securing employment and paying rent.  They pay differential rents based on their income, and that message has been lost to the general public.  The public believes that when we call on the State to build, we are somehow saying we should give out free houses and no one should have any responsibility to pay for them.<\/p><p>Of course, the State has some responsibility to ensure people have homes in which they can at least feel secure.  That is not free.  It is not free to the tenant who is quite welcoming of it.  It provides security for the State not to have children living in and being born in hotels and homeless accommodation.  Housing assistance payment, HAP, is an absolute disaster and needs to be revisited.  It requires a simple tweak of putting the responsibility on to local authorities to ensure support continues for tenants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":805,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Homelessness and the lack of affordable housing are the biggest social challenges facing our country today.  I would be interested in a global definition of homelessness.  Our homeless figures are hovering around 10,000 people, including 1,700 families and 3,500 children.  However, every month there is an argument with the Minister as he takes people off the homelessness list.  He took 200 this month and 600 last month.  We do not have any clear definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo;, however.<\/p> <p>  We all had an aspiration to owning our own home at some stage.  However, because of the affordability issue, there is a whole generation who can never aspire to owning their own homes.  Every politician genuinely wants to fix the problem.  We get down to the constitutional right versus the legal right to housing.  Examples have been given of Finland, Scotland, France and other countries where there is either a constitutional or a legal right to housing.  However, there still remains a housing crisis in some of these countries.  Is it down to the will of the people to fix the problem?

I was able to attend two presentations on this issue by the Mercy Law Resource Centre before, as well as the one today.  It has been bringing it to public attention.  Reference was made to having a bold and swift action and introducing such a right might break the cycle.  There have been many efforts but very little success in terms of addressing the issues.  Despite the fact we have a relatively functional economy, we have many of the same problems in housing.<\/p> <p>  I support the right to housing.  The Scottish model is statutory.  I would have thought in Ireland it would have to be constitutional because of the provision concerning property rights in the Constitution.  At one stage, the Government promised 11 constitutional referendums over the next few years.  Hopefully, removing the provision concerning women in the home will be the next one.  There will be an opportunity to bring the right to housing into the Constitution.  That is what will change practice.<\/p> <p>  In the Scottish model, the local authorities have the statutory obligation.  How would that work in Ireland?  Largely speaking, local authorities here do not raise most of their own moneys.  Accordingly, there is that interaction between what they get from the Government and what they raise themselves.  The question then arises as to how this would be implemented and monitored.<\/p> <p>  Ms Kerin spoke about progressively realising the right to housing.  That may need to be spelled out more fully because there probably is some scepticism in Ireland as to whether anything would happen, were such a provision put into the Constitution.  How does one make it happen?  Will she elaborate on how this works in other countries?<\/p> <p>  We need to keep this on the public agenda.  While there are financial elements to this, if housing is to be a human right, then it needs to come back to committees which deal with social rights, rather than those which deal with balancing the books.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#FF00300","speaker":"1325"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":807,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Leilani Farha and Ms Julieta Perucca for their presentations.  I thank Mr. David Joyce, Ms Sinead Kerin and others from the Mercy Law Resource Centre for their great work, as well as for often looking at and assisting with the cases that flow through my door of people facing the consequences of the current housing crisis.  I thank Ms Leilani Farha for her intervention over the past several days.  I attended her speech at the Simon Community event yesterday and everything she said was extremely welcome.  I hope the Government is listening.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, some committee members are fully behind this proposal.  Both Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I have put forward Bills on changing the Constitution to put the right to housing above property rights.  Deputy Pringle sought to bring in the covenant on economic and social rights.  In all cases, the Government voted them down, as did Fianna F&aacute;il.  The concern for property rights is the issue.  To my mind, that sets out the landscape with which we are dealing.  We will keep on going and, hopefully, these interventions today will help push us in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  Ms Leilani Farha made a point yesterday which would be useful to draw out here.  If human rights were being breached in respect of, for example, torture, then there would be an immediate intervention to stop it.  It is a useful way of putting it.  I believe having families, and children in particular, in a precarious housing situation for years, or in homeless emergency accommodation, or, worse, on the street, is a form of torture.<\/p><p>It would be useful if Ms Farha commented on that.  It is extremely damaging to a person's mental and physical health and general well-being and amounts to a form of institutional or State torture when people are being treated in that way.  Is that a fair way to put it?<br\/><br\/>Ms Farha also commented yesterday on the role property speculation is playing in our domestic housing and homelessness crisis and globally.  I welcome her comments, not least because I have tabled a motion on this issue which will be debated in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  It would be useful if she were to elaborate on that point because while we often discuss consequences such as the lack of public housing, we do not focus sufficiently on the fact that some people benefit from the torture experienced by those who are affected by homelessness and the housing crisis.  There is an inverse relationship between the suffering of the many and the profiteering of the few through property speculation, land hoarding and so on.  Does Ms Farha endorse that view?<br\/><br\/>My motion refers to dealing with the issue of vacant properties.  Will the witnesses comment on good examples of countries that have been able to return to use large numbers of empty and vacant properties?<br\/><br\/>On affordable housing, I believe one of the reasons the Irish Government stubbornly refuses to define the term is that if it were to do so in the way I suspect the witnesses would like it to be defined, that is, related to income and ability to pay, it would have an immediate impact on the private interests of developers.  If the State were to set a figure for what is affordable at significantly below the price at which housing can be bought on the open market, property developers or speculators would object.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<br\/><br\/>I refer to the inequalities in housing support and the housing assistance payment, HAP, raised by Mr. Joyce.  This is a terribly important issue.  Mr. Joyce described it in a way that had not fully struck me previously, even though I deal with the consequences every day.  Are these inequalities justiciable on the basis that the small difference between the HAP and rental accommodation schemes and the significant difference between those two schemes and local authority housing make all the difference in the world to people who are in housing trouble and cannot afford housing on the open market?  When the legislation giving effect to the housing assistance payment scheme was being introduced, I and a number of other Deputies pointed out that the Government's proposal to place responsibility for securing accommodation on the housing applicant would be a disaster, and so it has proved.  Would housing applicants have a case before the courts?  That possibility has never struck me before.  Could someone argue a case on the basis that he or she is receiving a different housing support of lesser quality from the State than a person on the HAP scheme and a support of even lesser quality than somebody who has been allocated a council house?  At the moment, the system is arbitrary and <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  There is no consistency as to who will get a RAS or HAP tenancy and who will be allocated a council house.  There is no rhyme or reason to the system.  Does Mr. Joyce believe legal cases could be taken on the basis of the argument that people are being discriminated against by being offered a lesser form of housing support?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#FF00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":809,"content":"<p>Deputy Mick Barry was due to contribute next but he has stepped out of the room.

I will deal with the last question first.  I believe there is clear discrimination given the definitions used in the housing legislation.  Across the various housing supports currently offered by housing providers, namely, local authorities, those in receipt of supports are treated in different ways.  Housing authorities come under the definition of a service provider for European equality legislation and even under the Constitution.  There is an expectation of equality before the law.  Distinctions are clearly being made between various recipients of housing supports who qualify.  The clearest discrimination exists between HAP recipients and local authority tenants.<br\/><br\/>I noted that legal action had been taken on equality grounds and non-discrimination grounds in other jurisdictions.  I mentioned a case from Canada and I see similarities in that case and what is occurring in our system.  Certain demographics will rely on one type of housing support.  If memory serves, in the Canadian case it was primarily single parents and women who were reliant on one particular type of private support as opposed to other supports offered by housing authorities.  In that case, it was successfully argued that there was an indirect discrimination against the recipient and the demographic in question.  I see the same discrimination here and it is an issue we have examined within our capacities.  It needs to be equality proofed under our domestic equality legislation and on the basis of constitutional rights and the right to equality before the law.  There are issues in this regard and we will examine them.  Lawyers in the equality area and generally should also examine them.<br\/><br\/>One of the first questions was on whether we need a change in the Constitution and if rights should be written into legislation.  This comes down to a fundamental approach as to who we believe should provide housing and social housing.  If we believe the State has this responsibility through local authorities, as housing providers, we do not necessarily need a constitutional change.  However, we have made an ideological decision in recent years that the private sector will also be contracted into social housing provision.  Having done this through the housing assistance payment and various amendments, we need a change in the Constitution to balance the rights of property owners with housing as a constitutional right.  If we go down the road of excessive reliance on the private sector and private landlords, we will need a constitutional right to housing and a balance of the property rights of individuals with social housing recipients.<br\/><br\/>If the State returns to a more direct role in housing provision, the most appropriate approach would be to strengthen legislation and create a clear right in law.  It is an ideological decision as to how we will provide social housing and housing to people who are qualified.  A basic right that sets a bare minimum or floor, as someone described earlier, could be written into the Constitution.  However, from a lawyer's perspective and from our perspective, the issue is who will be contracted to provide accommodation.  If the State takes a more direct hand in this area through local authorities and housing bodies, it will not be necessary to make a change to the Constitution and strong legislation would be sufficient.  If, however, we continue on the road we are on and maintain the provisions of the 2014 and 2009 Acts, under which social housing provision has been effectively subcontracted to the private sector, we will need to provide balancing rights in the Constitution.  We are haunted by the ghost of Blake <i>v.<\/i>Attorney General and interference with housing and private property.  We need a balance in favour of social housing and a person's right to shelter and a roof.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Joyce"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":811,"content":"<p>On constitutional protection for the right to housing, I will note briefly the relevant provision of the South African Constitution, which is as follows:<\/p><blockquote>Everyone has the right to access to adequate housing.  The State must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realisation of this right.<\/blockquote> <p>The issue is one of moving forward and legislation can be introduced subsequently.  It is not an issue of providing a key to a home but of moving forward and progressively realising the objective, much like the model adopted in Finland where there is a constant state of improvement.<\/p><p>Therefore, an obligation would be put on the council to provide emergency accommodation and limits would be placed on the length of stays in emergency accommodation.  That is progressively realising that right.  In none of the jurisdictions we examined was there a situation of judiciary versus the allocation of resources.  That difficulty does not arise.  It is not shown in any of the jurisdictions.  I do not know if our psyche causes us to be paranoid about private rights.  This involves the progressive realisation of a right.  It is a basic flow of protection.  It means trying to improve the situation going forward.  There is no right to a house <i>per se<\/i>.  The difficulty that arises between the judiciary and the allocation of resources is not played out in other countries.  I do not know where that difficulty would arise here because it is a progressive right.  It is not an absolute right.  That is our take on it.  None of the jurisdictions we looked at has that difficulty.  In South Africa, there is deference to the state as the legislature to allocate the resources as it sees it fit.  However, the job of the judiciary is to ensure it is proportionate, reasonable and balanced against other rights.  It is not a black or white situation.  It is about a balancing of the rights.  I hope that brings some clarity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sinead Kerin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":813,"content":"<p>I will pick up where Ms Kerin left off.  If one looks at the jurisprudence from around the world where the right to adequate housing has been litigated through constitutional provisions, the standard that has emerged is a reasonableness one.  Judges are inherently conservative in every country.  The reasonableness standard is just that.  It is reasonable.  Governments are expected to act in a way, under constitutional law and the right to adequate housing, that is reasonable as determined by a judge.  The quaking in one's boots about what it means to have a constitutional right to housing can be laid to rest if one just reads some of the jurisprudence.<\/p> <p>   I want to take another kick of the can regarding the constitutional provision.  I have been sitting here reflecting on the constitutional versus legislative position.  I do not know the whole legal landscape here but from my vantage point I have considered the situation in light of what has happened in Ireland and in light of the power property owners have here and worldwide.  Private equity firms and pension funds have been invited into the country.  Globally, residential real estate is valued at $163 trillion.  It is a business that is doing well.  Property owners are well-protected through tax provisions and a variety of other structures and infrastructure in this country and globally.  Ireland has private property protected in its Constitution.  That is fine.  One should ask how that looks in light of a lack of protection around the right to housing and in light of the power, strength and protections already afforded, without a constitutional protection, to property owners.  It is an optics thing almost in light of what is happening in Ireland at this point in time.<\/p> <p>  I was asked what can be done right away.  I will give due credit to Ms Perucca, who suggested this.  We had the advantage of meeting with NAMA yesterday.  It was a very interesting meeting.  The Government took some very quick, solid steps to set up NAMA.  It devoted resources to NAMA and ensured it did its job.  There was an energy around that to ensure the Government could recoup losses for the banks.  Surely the same energy and determination could be applied to address inadequate housing and homelessness in the country.  Everyone here has said it is an absolute crisis.  It is hitting the headlines, not only here but globally.  It is certainly on my radar and it brought me to this country.  I expect the Government could find the energy, enthusiasm, commitment and will it thinks is required to answer the crisis.  I think it can be found within Government to do something equal or more than what it has done through NAMA.  <\/p> <p>  I will move along because a whole bunch of questions were put on the table.  On the issue of homelessness and torture, I was not trying to draw a parallel between what it is like to live in homelessness and what it is like to be tortured.  I could not really weigh in on that.  Torture is recognised as a violation of human rights.  I am sure it is recognised in Ireland as a violation of human rights.  The right to housing is recognised as a human right by Ireland.  It has signed and ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  It enunciates in Article 11 that everyone shall have the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate housing.  Ireland believes that housing is a human right.  It has gone off to the UN and reported on the ways in which it is meeting those obligations.  Ireland did that in 2015 and the committee had recommendations for it.  Ireland has recognised it as a human right.  When a State recognises something as a human right, one expects human rights responses to violations of those rights.  Ireland has recognised torture as a violation of human rights.  One would not just throw a few policies and programmes at it to address it.  One would not just say we will have an anti-torture policy.  One would see it is a human rights violation, so we will accord to it the highest human rights protections.  Ireland has recognised Ireland as a human right so it must accord to it equally the highest human rights and constitutional protections.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of vacant properties, it is being dealt with around the world.  It is a problem around the world.  Mostly it is at city level or sub-national Government where one sees traction.  For example, high taxes are often put on secondary homes.  Paris started off with a 20% tax on vacant homes and found it was insufficient.  There is a huge number - over 20,000 - vacant homes in the city of Paris.  They found the tax was not high enough so they increased the secondary home tax to 60%.  That is a pretty high tax.  It is probably the most-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#HH00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Leilani Farha"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":814,"content":"<p>I love it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#HH00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":815,"content":"<p>I love it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#HH00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Leilani Farha"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":816,"content":"<p>That is what one wants to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#HH00500","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":817,"content":"<p>One should watch the mayor of Paris over the next number of years because she is doing all sorts of interesting things.

I am really interested in the issue of the power or lack of power of cities and local councils.  I wrote my first report on the human rights obligations with respect to housing in cities.  Anyone exercising Government authority has international human rights obligations.  I do not know if it is ripe for discussion in Ireland but I think it is a pretty interesting discussion to have.  What role could cities have if they had more power, resources and skills?<\/p> <p>  There were two questions about definitions.  I hope that a lack of a firm definition of homelessness would not keep any Government from acting on homelessness.  Certain people are homeless absolutely.  It is a gross violation of human rights.  There is an obligation and duty to act immediately.  I have come up with a definition of homelessness that I think is human-rights compliant.  It can be found in one of my reports.  Here it is obvious the definition is too narrow.  I find it shocking.  It is narrow perhaps because the Government wants to be very exact in its measurement.  The problem with that, as Ms Kerin rightly pointed out, is the numbers that are created and what is counted dictates policy.  We end up with this very narrow policy that is not human rights compliant.  Obviously people living on the streets are homeless.  They are not counted in Ireland's homeless numbers which seems odd.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#HH00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Leilani Farha"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":818,"content":"<p>They are counted but come under a different heading.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#HH00700","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":819,"content":"<p>What about women fleeing violence and living in shelters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#HH00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Leilani Farha"},{"type":"speech","time":1528803000,"counter":820,"content":"<p>They are not included in those numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#HH00900","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":821,"content":"<p>That is also odd.

I thank the witnesses for attending this morning.  I do not disagree with much of what was said, or the sentiment.  I am not sure how much Ms Farha knows of where Ireland has come from or what policies were in place here previously, but the initial action plan on dealing with homelessness was dealing with it in isolation, and that cannot be done.  We changed that into the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  Ms Farha spoke about a strategy that must prioritise those in most need.  Our strategy does that; the most vulnerable people in society always have to be looked after first.  That plan was not just a Government plan.  Some members here might have made submissions to that plan in some shape or form, as well as various organisations, economists, chartered surveyors, architects, the Peter McVerry Trust and the Simon Community.  All of these parties were involved in putting the plan together, which sought to deal with the totality of the housing problem and not just to treat it as an isolated issue.  That is the strategy we are working off.<\/p> <p>  Someone mentioned that the first can had been kicked and that the second can should now be kicked.  The second can is Rebuilding Ireland, and it takes a wide approach in terms of the issue.  I am not saying it is a perfect plan, but rather that it is the Government policy and that many people contributed to it.  We were dealing with a construction sector wherein activity had dropped by 90%.  We had mass emigration.  I do not really want to look back on that time because we have come so far since then, but I just want to provide some context.  We are trying to rebuild a country and the construction industry after unemployment had reached 16%.  Dealing with that issue had to be the priority at the time.<\/p> <p>  A whole-of-Government, cross-departmental approach must be taken.  Housing First is an example of such an approach.  An inter-agency group was established in September 2017 to co-ordinate the responses of people with complex medical and health needs, as well as for those from other countries who may not have housing rights in Ireland but are trapped in emergency accommodation.  A cross-departmental approach is taken when it comes to housing.  Such an approach must be taken.  The Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs, Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government are all involved.  A cross-departmental approach is being taken, and people can argue about that, agree or disagree or say that there are imperfections or that it is perfect.  I am not going to get into that, but it is actually happening.<\/p> <p>  I fully recognise what Mr. Joyce has said about leaning on the private sector, but in order to increase supply and to get the construction sector and financial institutions up and running, we are, unfortunately, reliant on a private rental market.  Our local authorities lost many members of staff and expertise during the downturn.  They also did not have the finances from 2008 onward to address the problems.  That has all taken time, but we are two years into a five year plan.  Our aim is that, by 2021, more people are in social housing supports than are in the private rental market schemes, such as HAP or RAS.  In my eyes, one homeless child or one homeless family is far too many.  I will not get into numbers; I hate putting numbers on the number of people who are going through difficult situations because each one is different and each needs a different response.  There is probably no one-size-fits-all solution.  I am of the view that we should treat people with respect when it comes to that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Farha does not have the time to answer many questions today.  I would have loved to have gone further in this discussion.  What has been done to get us to this point has not been mentioned.  It has not been perfect, but we have achieved a great deal in very difficult circumstances and with a budget of approximately &euro;6 billion.  Local authorities are now coming forward with ambitious plans on over 700 sites around the country where we can provide affordability, cost rental and social housing.  It cannot happen overnight.  Those proposals are now coming in.  I was at a launch of 12 houses last week in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where people were getting their keys.  We are starting to see results.  It is taking time, and it will take more time, which we can only expect.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to put into context the difficulties we have had and the point we are arriving at now.  One solution does not solve a housing crisis.  I say to Deputy &Oacute; Broin regularly that we may differ on how we propose achieving that solution, but everybody here wants that solution, for every family to be housed and for every individual to have a roof over his or her head.<\/p> <p>  I disagree with the proposal to insert housing as a right into the Constitution.  I do not have time to go into that because I let non-members of the committee speak before me, but I am sure we will have the chance to discuss the matter at another meeting.<\/p><p>We have to balance what is being done and what needs to be done.  We need to do a great deal more.  However, what we have done to get to this point has not been reflected in the meeting.  I am trying to provide a little of balance to that.  The priority is to put a roof over people's heads.  Whatever their circumstances, it is not for us to discriminate against anybody.  Deputy Mick Barry asked Ms Farha a direct question.  I do not know if she has time to answer it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#JJ01000","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":833,"content":"<p>I definitely want to answer it.  I will answer in point form.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I ask him to convey my thanks to the 16 families for sharing their difficult situation with me.  There is no doubt it is a global phenomenon.  Private equity firms are doing this in many countries.  I have witnessed it in Sweden, New York, Barcelona and London.  I know of nowhere it is considered illegal.  Some places deal with it differently from others because some have good protections around when rents can and cannot be escalated and to what extent.  It is a matter with which I am seized.  I wrote a report a year ago on the financialisation of housing.  I identified this as a troubling practice, which is certainly not compliant with governments' human rights obligations.  I stress that because it is up to the Government to ensure this does not happen, and to regulate the private sector accordingly and in compliance with its international human rights obligations.  The case of these 16 families, which the Deputy described, suggests that it is not being regulated sufficiently, at least not for the 16 families he mentioned.  I would very much appreciate more information about that situation because it is a matter with which I am seized.<\/p> <p>  On the comments made towards the end - I am sorry; I cannot read the members' names - I am not here to assess Ireland and my comments were not to meant to reflect that Ireland is not taking steps.  However, when I glance at Rebuilding Ireland, I note that the right to adequate housing is not mentioned, nor does it inform concept, standard or norm.  Ireland may not be as successful as it would like to be without that framework.  That framework necessitates and requires the right to adequate housing being entrenched either in the Constitution or in some legislative format.  I will rest my comments there.  I thank all the members for inviting me here.  I catapulted in and I appreciate that very much.  I hope I got things right and that I contributed to the committee's conversations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018061200002#KK00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Leilani Farha"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528803000,"counter":834,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for inviting us.

I thank the committee for this invitation to discuss supports provided by the Department for people with disabilities, particularly in respect of employment.<\/p><p> I will focus on three key areas as follows: working with other Government agencies and services to ensure good cross-governmental functioning to secure better employment outcomes; providing a range of income and employment supports and services to address the needs of people with disabilities; and engaging with people with disabilities to advise them of these supports and to guide them where appropriate to employment or to other services.<\/p><p> Before I say something about each of these, I would like first to recall some of the main statistics of relevance to this area.  According to Census 2016, there are almost 645,000 people living with a disability in Ireland.  In April 2016, there were 130,000 people with a disability at work of which 122,000 were in the working age population range.  People with disabilities, however, are still only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age.  Census 2016 figures show that the employment rate for people with disabilities of working age is 37% compared with a rate of 73% for people of working age without a disability.<\/p><p> We know that many people with disabilities want to work.  In our survey of 2015, 35% of people not then working said they wanted to work part time, while 8% said they wanted to work full time.  Young people with disabilities are likely to start out with lower employment rates and the gap widens with age as people leave employment.<\/p><p> The data tell us that to improve employment rates we need a twofold approach: early engagement with young people with disabilities and a focus on retention of those already established in the workforce.  For young people, the potential benefits are greatest in the crucial years following school to young adulthood when otherwise their disability threatens to keep them out of the workforce.  For older people, the advantages of early engagement can also apply to those who acquire disabilities later in life and who may need retraining and other supports to stay in the workforce.<\/p><p> The comprehensive employment strategy was adopted by Government in October 2015 having been developed in consultation with Departments, State agencies, the National Disability Authority, NDA, and disability stakeholders.  The ten-year strategy is a cross-governmental one co-ordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality and provides a roadmap to ensure that people with a disability who are able to and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is engaged in delivering 33 actions through the comprehensive employment strategy.  Progress to date includes the publication in April 2017 of the Make Work Pay report.  This was an interdepartmental report with independent external participation and chaired by Professor Frances Ruane.  We have either implemented or made significant progress on some of the recommendations and I will return to some of these later.<\/p><p> The Department has worked jointly on the pilot project to integrate employment and mental health support which was developed with Genio and departmental funding and in partnership with the HSE mental health division, EmployAbility companies and Mental Health Reform.  A central objective of this project was to improve integration between public mental health and supported employment services at national and local levels.  There has been joint working, supported by the National Disability Authority, NDA, with the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills, on action 5.1 which focuses on transition points for people with disabilities.  The group has produced a report agreed by Government, to be published shortly, outlining the policy approach and an implementation plan.<\/p><p> More generally, the Department participates in the comprehensive employment strategy implementation group chaired independently by Mr. Fergus Finlay who produces an annual report.  We provide a range of income and employment supports.  The primary income supports for people with disabilities are disability allowance, invalidity pension and partial capacity benefit.  Disability allowance is a means-tested payment for people who are aged between 16 and 66.  To qualify a person must be substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment.  Disability allowance is structured so that a person who wishes to do so may take up employment and still retain all, or a significant portion of, his or her payment, thereby ensuring that work is seen to pay.  The first &euro;120 of weekly earnings is disregarded in the means test for the payment while weekly earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 are assessed at 50%.  A single person earning more than &euro;420 a week can retain the minimum amount of disability allowance and continue to qualify for the free travel pass.<\/p><p>A number of contributors to the joint committees mentioned that uncertainty around the retention of benefits, including the medical card, represents a barrier to people with disabilities exploring their work options.  The Make Work Pay report made a number of recommendations, including that the requirement that work be of a rehabilitative nature for the disability allowance earnings disregard should be dispensed with.  This would mean that a report from a doctor would no longer be required before commencing work and that the focus is on capacity rather than incapacity.  Legislation is required to give effect to this change and is included in the Social Welfare Bill 2017.  Currently, 10% of disability allowance recipients - about 13,000 people - avail of the disability allowance earnings disregard.<br\/><br\/>Other recent changes to the income supports to make them easier to retain if employment is taken up include the extension of entitlement to a travel pass to five years after commencing full-time employment or exceeding the appropriate income threshold, which exceeds the three years recommended in the Make Work Pay report; a fast-track return to disability allowance if employment does not work out; a clear statement that disability allowance payments will not be stopped or reviewed on the basis of an enquiry about work at an Intreo centre; and the introduction of an online benefit of work estimator to assist people with disabilities in assessing the impact of taking up work on their disability payment.  Since the launch of the Make Work Pay report, just over 800 disability allowance recipients have entered full-time employment and ceased claiming the allowance.<br\/><br\/>Invalidity pension<b><\/b>is an income support payment paid to people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or disability.  It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and is not means tested.  While invalidity pension is generally paid to pension age, where a person with a disability wishes to return to work, he or she may apply for partial capacity benefit.  Partial capacity benefit was introduced in February 2012 and is designed for people who are in receipt of long-term social insurance invalidity, illness or disability income support payments who have some capacity for work.<br\/><br\/>As well as providing these income supports, the Department also provides a range of supports specifically intended to improve employment outcomes for persons with a disability.  The EmployAbility service, for example,<b><\/b>is a nationwide employment service funded by the Department and dedicated to improving employment outcomes for jobseekers with a disability.  There are 23 limited companies, each with a specific geographical remit.  The Ability programme<b><\/b>is the new pre-activation programme for young people.  The focus of the programme will be on projects aimed at young people who have disabilities and who are aged between 15 and 29 and it is designed to assist in their transition from school to further education and employment.  This will be undertaken using person-centred, case management approaches that support participants to identify and follow progression pathways based on both their needs and their potential.  We also provide a range of grants under the reasonable accommodation fund and the disability awareness training support scheme to assist employers in the private sector to take appropriate measures to enable a person with a disability or impairment to have access to employment.<br\/><br\/>The Department also funds two significant disability projects directed at participants in third level education.  The Willing Able Mentoring programme, WAM, builds the experience and confidence of graduates with disabilities and employers through the method of a mentored work placement programme which is paid for by the employer programme.  Get AHEAD is a training programme and forum for students and graduates with disabilities to discuss their experiences of education and employment.<br\/><br\/>On engaging with persons with disabilities through the public employment service, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, DEASP, network of 62 Intreo centres provides a gateway for people with disabilities who wish to explore their work options and they may voluntarily look for an appointment with a case officer to discuss their work ambitions and develop a personal plan to progress their goals.  We recognise that our engagement with people with disabilities will require developing our employees' skills in engaging with them.  In November 2016, a certificate in professional practice in employability services provided through the National College of Ireland was introduced for DEASP staff.  There is good coverage of disability issues, including a guest lecturer who is a specialist in the area, and contributions from two staff development unit case officer trainers specialising in DEASP supports for people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned earlier, the publication of the Make Work Pay report in April 2017 marked an important step in the identification of specific actions that are intended to secure better employment outcomes for people with disability.  The report made many recommendations, including that disability allowance payments and other schemes should be reconfigured for new entrants aged 18 and over to ensure that their work ambitions could be explored systematically at an early age.  This is referred to as the principle of early engagement.<\/p><p> Following the publication of the report and the recognition that some of the recommendations may be controversial, the then Minister indicated that the Government wanted to consult persons with disabilities and their families on some of the recommendations.  We engaged an experienced facilitator to ensure the consultation process was as wide-ranging as possible and included representation from a wide range of stakeholders.  The information documents were designed to allow people with disabilities and their families to provide an input to the process.  We made considerable efforts to ensure that the materials were fully accessible.  The documents were also produced in a range of accessible formats such as easy read, Braille, audio, video captioned and Irish Sign Language.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, and Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, launched the consultation process in Richmond Barracks, Inchicore, Dublin 8, on 7 March 2018.  Regional seminars were held in Cork, Dublin, Sligo and Limerick during March and April this year.  The findings of the consultation process are being consolidated and a report will be prepared for the Minister and Minister of State on the outcome of the consultation process when it is finalised to inform the next steps in the implementation of the Make Work Pay report. <\/p><p> In conclusion, I hope this presentation demonstrates that while many supports and services are in place to assist people with a disability to fulfil their employment ambitions, the Department is very active in addressing the objectives of the comprehensive employment strategy in trying to improve the employment rates of people with a disability.  The multifaceted nature of the barriers faced by persons with a disability calls for a similarly multifaceted approach and the Department is pursuing a range of actions across a number of areas to achieve this.  The fall in unemployment and the transformation of the Intreo service provide an opportunity to make significant progress in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Simonetta Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528801200,"counter":846,"content":"<p>I thank the Co-Chairman and members.  I am principal officer in the special education section of the Department of Education and Skills.  I am joined by Phil O'Flaherty, who is the principal officer for further education and training in the Department.  I apologise for the late delivery of our remarks; I was out of the country late last week which contributed to the delay.<\/p> <p>  I thank the joint committees for the invitation to today's meeting.  We are aware of the joint hearings of 3 and 29 May and will try to address the matters highlighted during those meetings.  Our\u00a0 statement today will primarily address the provisions made for supporting children with special educational needs to support participation in further studies, training or employment, the supports available in the further education sector to facilitate access to further education and the transition from further education to employment and career guidance for those with a special educational need.  <\/p> <p>  The Department recognises the importance of planning for transitions throughout a child's education and at present all schools are required to develop education plans for all children identified with special educational needs and additional care support needs.  The Department's inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special educational needs, which is welcomed by the Department.<\/p><p>Educational plans should be differentiated in line with pupils' needs.  A student's support plan should include clear, measurable learning targets and specify the resources and interventions that will be used to address student needs in line with the continuum of support process.  Individualised support plans for students should be developed through a collaborative process involving relevant teachers, parents and guardians, the pupils themselves and outside professionals, as necessary.  The individualised planning process should include regular reviews of learning targets as part of an ongoing cycle of assessment, target setting, intervention and review.<\/p><p> Members may know that the comprehensive review of the special needs assistant, SNA, scheme was published by the NCSE on 30 May.  It has found that while the scheme is greatly valued by parents, students and schools and works well in meeting the care needs of younger students it is less effective for some older primary and post-primary students, as over-reliance on SNA support has been found to result in some of students experiencing alienation and stigma.  It also found that there can be an overdependence on SNA support, leaving some young people inadequately prepared for life in post-school settings, and it is seen as a blunt instrument to deal with the wide range and variety of needs, ages, developmental stages and school settings.  The Department is now developing proposals to implement the review's recommendations in consultation with other key Departments and agencies.<\/p><p> Turning to further education, a major focus of the further education and training strategy is to deliver skills for the economy and support active inclusion of all citizens.  These twin goals are closely connected and both point to the importance of assisting people with disabilities to access employment.<\/p><p> Overall in 2017, more than 17,000 people with a disability were enrolled in a wide range of mainstream further education and training, FET, programmes.  Details on all FET programmes are available on the FET courses website.  Learners on FET programmes have access to appropriate guidance services.  Some programmes also provide income support by enabling learners to retain their entitlements under schemes provided by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and have provision for meal and travel allowances.  The Higher Education Authority fund for students with disabilities also funds services and support for students with a disability in post-leaving certificate colleges.<\/p><p> SOLAS and the Department meet regularly with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss issues relating to the training and upskilling of unemployed people and those on other payments.  Protocols are in place between Intreo offices and education and training boards, ETBs, to deal with issues relating to the planning of training and the management of referrals.  This provides a good opportunity for the Department, SOLAS and the ETBs to assist the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as it looks to extend the employment services and supports for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> SOLAS, through the education and training boards, also provides specific funding of almost &euro;47 million per annum for dedicated education and training for people with disabilities through specialist training providers.  More than 3,500 learners benefitted from this provision in 2017.  Generally, this provision is accessed by people who need more intensive support.  Features of the programme include longer duration, adapted equipment and transport arrangements.<\/p><p> SOLAS regularly commissions follow-up surveys to establish what happens to participants, primarily in terms of outcomes, after they leave the FET training delivered by ETBs.  The most recent follow-up survey was conducted in 2017 and it surveyed those who exited ETB training in the period from January to March 2016.  Within this survey, a customised survey to gain feedback from participants with a disability who participated in specialist training programmes, STPs, was conducted.  The findings included outcomes indicating that 26% were in employment, 4% were on Government schemes and 15% were engaged in further study.  There are plans to extend the approach to monitoring outcomes in order that we can also get a better picture of how people with disabilities on mainstream programmes do after completing their courses.<\/p><p> SOLAS engages with ETBs each year to discuss funding priorities, taking account of local need and labour market data.  This year, SOLAS has required ETBs to set out how they are addressing barriers to accessing FET.  This is done in the light of the 2017 SOLAS report on barriers for vulnerable groups accessing FET.  A fuller picture of initiatives in place at ETB level will emerge from this process and provide a basis for determining future supports.<\/p><p> The Department recognises that there are still access difficulties in some FET settings.  Until now, the scope available to address these difficulties has been limited as no specific capital budget was allocated for FET.  Enhanced allocations of capital funds for the sector over the period of the national development plan will give greater capacity to address these issues.<\/p><p> Turning to apprenticeships, the Department noted that many contributors to the previous joint committee hearings spoke about the potential of apprenticeship to provide access for people with disabilities to the labour market.  A total of 371 current apprentices, out of a total population of almost 13,500, report as having a disability.<\/p><p>As part of a review on &quot;Pathways to Participation in Apprenticeship&quot;, which is due to be completed at the end of June 2018, research is being undertaken on barriers to participation by people from diverse groups, including those with a disability.  Alongside this research, SOLAS is conducting caf&eacute; dialogue sessions to further inform recommendations for the review.  Attendees at the sessions have included individuals from organisations representing people with disabilities.  It is expected that the expansion of apprenticeship into new sectors, giving access to a much broader range of job opportunities and occupation types, will also assist in enabling people with disabilities access this valuable pathway to employment.  As members know, the Disability Act 2005 places an obligation on public bodies, including our own Departments, to ensure that at least 3% of their workforces are people with disabilities.<br\/><br\/>I turn to career guidance for those with a special educational need.  Guidance in schools refers to a range of learning experiences provided in a developmental sequence that assist students to develop self-management skills which will lead to effective choices and decisions about their lives.  It encompasses the three separate but interlinked areas of personal and social development, educational guidance and career guidance.  For all children in mainstream post-primary schools, including those with special educational needs in mainstream or special classes, the support of the guidance counsellor is available where it has been provided to the school.  There is no other additional or separate guidance support for children with special educational needs and there is currently no policy to support an alternative or separate guidance provision for children with special educational needs in mainstream post-primary.  That is in keeping, I suppose, with the policy of inclusion which the Department supports.<br\/><br\/>In mainstream post-primary schools, it is common practice for the school guidance counsellor and the special educational needs, SEN, co-ordinator to work very closely in liaising with parents and the feeder primary schools, analysing psychometric assessments, identifying and supporting the needs of students with special educational needs, advising students and their parents on the most suitable subject choices and programme options, and facilitating students to secure appropriate work experience as part of the transition year, leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programmes.  The SEN and guidance teams collaborate in facilitating students to apply for supports such as the reasonable accommodation for certificate examinations, RACE, scheme, the disability access route to education, DARE, scheme and other access routes into further and higher education and employment.<br\/><br\/>A key role of the guidance counsellor is to develop close links with employers, access officers in colleges, SOLAS training and apprenticeship schemes and other organisations, such as the National Learning Network, with a view to maximising the opportunities for students with special educational needs and other disabilities to access further education, training and jobs.  The National Learning Network offers 70 different training programmes, including vocational and rehabilitative courses, to up to 5,000 students annually, many of whom have a disability and wish to up-skill, gain employment and live more independent lives.  The programmes are funded through the Education and Training Boards and the Health Service Executive.  The courses are free and individualised and offer a variety of awards including QQI levels 1 to 6, ECDL and City and Guilds.  Of those students who completed a training programme last year, 90% went on to further education and training.<br\/><br\/>For students in special schools<b>, <\/b>the position is somewhat different.  Special schools are substantially different from mainstream schools and these students typically have very different needs. <br\/><br\/>In all cases, the classroom teacher and other school staff are more intimately aware of the abilities and strengths of all students than would be the case in mainstream schools.  That is partly because of the average pupil-teacher ratio of less than 5:1 and the special needs assistant ratio of 3:1 in the majority of special schools.  Special school staff typically have extensive engagement with parents, HSE multi-disciplinary teams and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which involves planning for the child's future, including options for further education, training, employment or other placement options subject to the child's abilities, including the young person's transition to adult services when the child reaches the age of 18 years.  Students who transfer to adult service settings can continue to participate in educational programmes through further adult educational programmes or in adult settings which are allocated resources towards educational provision.<br\/><br\/>The National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019 provide for a career guidance review that will include recommendations on changes to improve the existing career guidance tools and career information for post-primary, further education, higher education students and adults currently in place across the education and training system in Ireland.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that we are providing high quality, relevant career guidance information to students from post&ndash;primary level up to further and higher education.  The review will look at the quality of information available to students and adults in relation to career guidance, the sources of this information and how the system is organised to support students and adults in this area.<\/p><p>The review will look at the quality of information available to students and adults on career guidance, the sources of this information and how the system is organised to support students and adults in this area.  Opportunities have been provided for all relevant stakeholders to contribute to the review.  More than 100 written submissions have been received, including a significant number of submissions from special schools.  Drawing on the results of the consultation process and further consideration by the steering group, the specific role and objectives of career guidance in supporting students in special schools will be assessed further.<\/p><p> Related to the area of career guidance, some stakeholders have spoken about work experience.  The Action Plan for Education 2018 includes an action to commence a review of work experience at post-primary level with a view to increasing access to, and the quality of, work experience for students.  This review is at the early planning stages with a steering group to be established which will then define terms of reference and a project plan for the review.<\/p><p> While noting the broadly complimentary remarks made in a previous hearing concerning access to higher education for persons with disabilities, it may be helpful to provide some information on the higher education sector.  Student support services in higher education institutions usually include an equity of access office, dedicated disability services and a career guidance support service.  The central role of disability officers is to provide supports and services to students with disabilities to assist them in accessing higher education and successfully completing, as well as to ensure compliance with the legal requirement to provide reasonable accommodations as appropriate.  A key ambition of the National Access Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 is to achieve the implementation of more inclusive practices and integrated approaches which contribute to the realisation of a student body which reflects the diversity and social mix of the population.<\/p><p> Perhaps the most important measure of how well access to higher education is facilitated is to note that the proportion of higher education entrants indicating they have a disability has increased from 6% in 2012 to 10.3% in 2016.  The challenge, of course, is to maintain and build on these numbers.<\/p><p> The Department is represented on the working group of the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities strategic priority action 5.1, which is led by the National Disability Authority.  It focusses on transition points for people with disabilities.  The group has produced a report agreed by the Government, to be published shortly, outlining the policy approach and an implementation plan.<\/p><p> Significant progress has been made in supporting learners with disabilities across the range of school levels and into further and higher education.  The comprehensive employment strategy framework will also help us advance the cross-departmental co-operation which may be necessary in some areas.  It gives us visibility and access to colleagues in other Departments.  I thank the committee for the invitation today to present to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Mulkerrins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Jim Mulkerrins for his presentation.

Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers, along with a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  Services, in the main, are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers.  Voluntary agencies provide the majority of services in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE.  The range of specialist disability services provided to people with disabilities includes residential; respite; day services and rehabilitative training; assisted living services, namely home support and personal assistant services; early intervention and school-aged services through progressing disability services for children and young people 0-18 years; multidisciplinary supports; aids and appliances; neuro-rehabilitation services; financial allowances; and miscellaneous support services.<\/p> <p>  Disability services were allocated &euro;1.78 billion in 2018.  This funding is providing specialist disability services to 36,000 persons across all nine CHO, community healthcare organisation, areas, ensuring that services are delivered in line with nationally agreed policy for persons with a disability, while, at the same time, endeavouring to maximise value.  A wide range of disability services is provided to those with physical, sensory, intellectual disability and\/or autism.<\/p><p>Over 60% of the resources available are allocated to provide a range of residential services to approximately 8,400 people with a disability.  A further 20% is targeted at the provision of more than18,000 day places and supports to nearly 25,000 people.  The remaining 20% provides respite care services to just over 5,700 people, over 4 million personal assistant and home support hours for 2,500 people, as well as multi-disciplinary teams and other community services and supports to children.<\/p><p> Last month, I met the Joint Committee on Public Petitions on the HSE-funded personal assistant service.  I am also aware that personal assistants, PAs, have been discussed in this forum.  The term \"personal assistance user\" refers to a person with a disability choosing a personal assistant of his or her choice to aid him or her in everyday tasks.  The 2004 Health Act does not mandate the HSE to provide PA services.  It is, rather, an ancillary service.  However, the Department of Health and the HSE are committed to protecting the level of personal assistant services available to persons with disabilities.  From 2013, the HSE has consistently, year on year, increased the number of hours of PA service delivered to persons with a disability.  Last year, 1.5 million hours were provide to approximately 2,500 people at a cost of &euro;42 million.<\/p><p> Day services are a key component of support services that enable service users to live within the community.  Currently, day services are transitioning to a new approach outlined in the policy, New Directions.  This policy is underpinned by the values of person centredness, community inclusion, active citizenship and quality.  There are approximately 25,000 people availing of day services and there is an annual intake of approximately 1,000 additional young people who require such a service on leaving school.<\/p><p> Within the New Directions service approach, people in receipt of a HSE-funded day service are offered a choice of 12 supports.  These include support for making choices and plans; support for inclusion in one's local community; support for accessing education and formal learning; support for maximising independence; and, support for accessing vocational training and work opportunities.<\/p><p> The first support referred to is support for making choices and plans.  This sets the foundation for each individual's service.  A person-centred plan is formulated for each individual and within that context, if a person has ambition to progress to employment, a plan is developed to support the person to achieve this target.  The plan may incorporate a range of all of the 12 supports.<\/p><p> The range of supports and the timeframe involved in supporting a person to achieve his or her goal will depend on the needs and abilities of each individual.  One of the key supports for people who express a wish to progress to employment is support for accessing vocational training and work opportunities.  Within this support, depending on a person's social and work-related skills, preparation for the world of work commences.  This support will include work experience placements which can act as a transition for people into employment.<\/p><p> The rehabilitative training programme, which is also provided within the framework of New Directions, acts as a foundation programme for people with disabilities.  Work-related social skills are also a key focus of this programme together with work experience placements and trialling of vocational training programmes.  There are rehabilitative training programme places available throughout the country.  Rehabilitative training places are managed at CHO level and are often reallocated or moved within the CHO area to meet demand.  They include all ages and disabilities, including mental health.<\/p><p> Since 2016, all HSE CHOs are allocated the funding required to meet the needs of all school leavers in their area.  All school leavers in 2017 received the quantum of day service requested and a similar outcome is envisaged for this year's school leavers.<\/p><p> The HSE is allocating &euro;12.5 million in 2018, that is, &euro;25 million in a full year, to provide appropriate services and supports to young people with disabilities and autism who will require continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative - life skills - training this year.  As part of the annual school leaver day service process, each service user seeking a day service is individually profiled to ensure that he or she receives the level of support required.<\/p><p> The Department and the HSE works closely with the National Disability Authority and are grateful for its support in ensuring that the right supports are provided at the right time to support each school leaver to maximise his or her potential.<\/p><p> Earlier, I spoke about day services and employment supports.  The range of supports offered can include work experience, therapeutic work following a clinical recommendation, employment in the open labour market and supported employment.  Supported employment can include the national employability programme, which my colleague, Ms Simonetta Ryan, from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, spoke about, or service provider supported employment initiatives.<\/p><p>In the absence of appropriate supported employment programmes being available to people with disabilities in recent years the HSE has funded some providers to provide this element of employment.  This support will continue for those who are availing of it while a more responsive arrangement is developed as part of the comprehensive employment strategy.<\/p><p> The Department of Health and the HSE are collaborating with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills as part of the comprehensive employment strategy 2015-2024.  This initiative is led and co-ordinated by the Department of Justice and Equality, which has a co-ordinating role for disability matters.  With the assistance of the National Disability Authority, the Departments are exploring the development of a pilot project to test the policy approach for a comprehensive supported employment programme.  Such a programme could be implemented over 2018 to 2020 and focus on a specific target group.  This will provide learning for any future scaling of such an approach.<\/p><p> The 2017 report of the Make Work Pay group made two principal recommendations regarding medical cards to address a barrier to employment for people with disabilities.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has committed to deliver on the recommendation to raise the medical card earnings disregard from its current level of &euro;120 per week for people on disability allowance or on partial capacity benefit associated with invalidity pension.  The Department has collaborated with colleagues in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and is working with the HSE on the operational aspects to enable implementation of this recommendation as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> A second recommendation made by the group sought to amend the medical card guidelines requiring that employment must be of a rehabilitative nature for the associated income to be disregarded when being assessed for a medical card.  I am pleased to say that the guidelines were amended and the disregard has applied since April 2017.<\/p><p> Disability is not a health issue or an education issue or an employment issue.  It is, however, an equality issue and Government has had a whole-of-government approach to disability for a number of years.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has responsibility for disability issues in the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Department of Health.  The Department of Justice and Equality is the lead Department for policy co-ordination for all disability and equality issues.  The Department of Health works on a cross-sectoral collaborative basis with colleagues in Departments on national policies for adults and children with a disability.  For instance, an interdepartmental cross-sectoral group at assistant secretary level meets regularly to ensure a co-ordinated approach to policy development across the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs, and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We know that more people with a disability have more complex needs.  Government is responding by providing the supports that people with disabilities need to live the full and independent lives that we all take for granted.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting me here today.  I am glad to have the opportunity to meet in such a collaborative forum and I am happy to take any health related questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Patsy Carr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":852,"content":"<p>The first comment I wish to make relates to the three presentations.

Ms Carr said that disability is not a health issue or an education issue or an employment issue but an equality issue.  She said Government has taken a whole-of-government approach to disability for a number of years.<\/p><p>At our two previous sessions, the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, indicated that the current activation measures are not impacting on the employment rates of people with disabilities in post-recession Ireland.  That view is echoed by numerous other organisations that deal specifically with people with disabilities.  There are serious question marks over how successfully the measures are impacting on the ground.<\/p><p> To home in on one area, much has been said about the comprehensive employment strategy which has been in place for two years.  The strategy has not had any impact on the employment levels of people with disabilities.  That view is borne out by statistics that are available for everybody to see and have been referred to in a couple of presentations.  It has also been echoed by the DFI and other organisations.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has responsibility for 33 actions in the comprehensive employment strategy, most of which were to be delivered in 2016.  How many of those specific actions have been implemented?  I can state categorically that few of them have been implemented, even though the target date for implementation was 2016.

The most obvious action to point out is the large amount of work done on the Make Work Pay report, consulting people with a disability to try to come up with the best way to take matters forward.

In the past month or so, we have built on DACT by introducing a mainstream programme known as the Ability programme which implemented the findings of the review of the DACT programme.  The review included a number of recommendations, including several on systematic engagement with people with disabilities.  That recommendation also featured in the Making Work Pay report.  For the past year, my colleagues and I have been engaging with disability groups, parents and stakeholders on how this recommendation could be implemented in practice, particularly how the principle of early engagement with young people might be systematised in Intreo services.

It talks about a lot of activity, but there is no critical analysis of what is working, or rather what is not working, where additional resources are required, where enabling legislation is required or anything else.  That is very disappointing because there is very little we can do with the information supplied.

The reality is that he was discharged almost a year ago.  He is in the wrong setting and his bed is needed by about 50 other people.  That is the reality.<\/p><p> Can I ask the HSE how it can possibly be, with all this activity going on and all this emphasis on and work and money aimed at helping people with disability lead as full a life as they can, that someone can be discharged from the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, last September and still be meeting me, his clinicians and members of the HSE last Friday?

There has been a lot of talk about the need for assessment and the need for transition.  Certainly in Wicklow, and I imagine in most if not in every other constituency, one of the most frustrating conversations one has as a Deputy when canvassing is to meet the parents of children with disabilities who are waiting for years for assessment.<\/p><p>I am not even talking about getting the supports; I mean for assessment.  I met a mother whose daughter has serious spinal issues who has been waiting a year for an assessment for a wheelchair because the curvature of the wheelchair that she has is wrong.  She is in pain and cannot use the wheelchair.  She sits on the ground for most of the time.  She is not waiting a year for a wheelchair; she is waiting a year for someone to assess the wheelchair requirement.  In the meantime the HSE will not fix wheelchairs and throws them into a big skip.<\/p><p> I talk to parents who are waiting literally years for speech and language assessment for their children.  We all know that early assessment is incredibly invaluable.  How is that happening?  Is anything being done to get the assessments and the supports in place for young children with various disabilities, be they physical, learning or intellectual disability.  It seems that things are moving in the wrong direction and that this is a profoundly stupid, dangerous, damaging and unnecessary thing for us a State to be doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#P00700","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528801200,"counter":888,"content":"<p>There are three separate questions there and I will have to bounce some of this back to Ms Carr because the main provider of assessments is the HSE.  However, we have a National Educational Psychological Service.  Its function is not to provide assessments but to upskill and support schools and to ensure that they are supporting children within the schools as well as they possibly can.  We are conscious of the long delays that have been there for assessments historically and we have been engaging with our colleagues in the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, in a cross-sectoral format on a very regular basis about this.  Back as far as 2012, we engaged with the National Disability Authority, NDA, and it was telling us at the time that assessments just for educational supports were costing the equivalent of in excess of 75 whole-time equivalent psychologists across the State.  We took the view that that was wasteful because it is better that our therapists and practitioners are providing services rather than assessing for services.  We were proactive about this and the committee will be aware that we introduced a new resource teacher allocation model in September 2017, which removed the need for an assessment in order that resources would be provided.  In the past, a child had to have an assessed disability before additional teaching hours were provided but that is no longer the case.<\/p> <p>  The special needs assistant, SNA, review I mentioned in my presentation contains similar recommendations.  Hopefully, if these recommendations are accepted and implemented by Government in the future, it will no longer be necessary for children to have an assessment of need before they can access SNA-type support.  I am conscious that that review also had a number of other recommendations which primarily all blend together to ensure that in future children will get the right support from the right person and at the right time.  In order that that would happen the over-reliance of the assessment of need process will be discontinued or rolled down.  We know, of course, that children will continue to need assessment for clinical reasons and perhaps to guide the professionals and practitioners in understanding the levels of support and the types of needs that children have.<\/p> <p>  On speech and language therapy, we are very conscious, that while the Department of Education and Skills is not currently the provider of speech and language therapy services, there is a commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government to develop an in-school approach and language support service to ensure that children can get access when and as they need support.  To that end, from this September, in collaboration with our colleagues in the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, we will roll out a pilot project across CHO 7, involving 76 schools, including a number of special schools, and 76 preschools, where therapy services will be delivered in school in line with the continuum of support service - a high level of support for the higher level of need; a middle level of support for the middle level of need and a whole school approach to children to try to identify and deal with needs as they first arise in order to try to prevent them from getting worse, so to speak.<\/p> <p>  That pilot is being rolled out in on a collaborative basis.  We work on a very regular basis with our colleagues in the Department of Health to ensure that the need for clinical governance and clinical support for therapists currently being recruited for this particular pilot will be available.  The HSE will do the recruitment process for us and the NCSE will manage the programme for us.  This heralds a new era of enhanced co-operation and collaboration between our Departments to ensure that children get access to supports without having to wait years for assessments.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, will manage the programme.

I accept this will take some time.

Something that came across very strongly was that the huge level of administrative and bureaucratic work that individuals have to undertake - sometimes in a supported capacity, since they may be lucky enough to have strong advocates, or they may not - seems to begin again at each new chapter in their lives.  There is a question of transition points.  A key reason we have all these Departments in together is those problems of transition points.  I will not ask for all of the points in the comprehensive employment strategy to be discussed.  I am sure we are due to receive a report on that.  It would have been wonderful if one that was mentioned was ready in time for these hearings since it relates strongly to them.  It is priority action 5.1, which focuses on transition points for persons with a disability.

That was a key question.  I will give input regarding a couple of points that really struck me on that issue of transition points from the testimony of others.  Special needs assistants were mentioned.  People may have had special needs assistance in our higher education institutions or post-primary institutions and then find themselves wishing to transition into employment but the educational supports that they had were tied to their educational chapter.  There are people who may have managed to navigate and, for example, receive a degree but in that period immediately afterwards, when it is so important for translating into employment, they are almost entering a brand new system cold, starting the negotiations again and trying to get support again, rather than having a period of overlap which allows them to transition into employment.  That was one example.  Those transitions are a key concern.  I welcome that there is a fast-track for those who may seek to leave disability allowance and return to it.  It is positive that that may happen a number of times.<\/p><p>I have a couple of concerns on the social protection system.  One is the fact that people can become invisible in terms of their disability at a number of points.  For example, if somebody transitions into full-time employment the fact he or she is a person with disability can become invisible.  We have talked about the level of income disregard on medical cards.  There are many situations when we talk about making work pay and the cost of disability where people may well need quite extensive medical supports over the course of a lifetime that are not going to go away and are not going to be fundable.  We heard from people who felt they had to go back on disability allowance because of that cost and the fear they would lose their entitlement to the medical card and who would have preferred not to be getting disability allowance and the medical card but simply getting the medical card.  However, they had to transition back to get both again.<\/p><p> The other concern I have is where people get to pension age and they disappear as somebody with a disability in terms of the visibility of that issue.  There were a lot of concerns on the question of the invalidity pension.  The transition to partial capacity benefit was mentioned.  Partial capacity benefit is an interesting one because the recognition of partial capacity is not as well recognised for those on a disability allowance, although they have the disregard.  Given that we know some people are working, using the income disregard while on disability allowance, and others are seeking to work, and perhaps Ms Ryan might answer this question, are there quality part-time educational and employment options that recognise that people may be available and seeking work on a part-time basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#R01200","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":902,"content":"<p>Would the Senator like answers to some of those-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#S00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":903,"content":"<p>Yes.

We have the two different schemes - invalidity pension and disability allowance.  They are different schemes and have different conditionality.  One is based on contributions and the other is means-tested and the payment rates are slightly different.  It always becomes complicated if one tries to merge two schemes because it does not lend itself to it.  We are doing a lot on the ground with people and are developing our services to engage with people.  If the committee would like it, we can talk a little about what we are doing.  We recognise also that we have a lot more to do and that is what hopefully will come from the work we have done on the Make Work Pay and the article 5.1 group.  Part of that is to look at how one helps people who need more supports and what are the options as one goes forward.  All these things, to some extent, have to be iterative, because one has to try different ways of working to see what is going to work.<\/p> <p>  The Senator talked about the full-time or part-time option.  As regards part-time, we have the part-time capacity benefit for people on illness pension.  That is a good scheme.  Given that disability allowance, DA, is different, the way it is dealt with in DA is through the disregards.  There is an option for people on DA to work and to still retain quite a lot of benefits for quite a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Simonetta Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I am talking education and part-time options and not simply the entitlement to same.  I refer to things like quality part-time educational options.  For example, the CE scheme is one of the few schemes that is part-time.  Perhaps this is too micro in detail but that is not available to people on certain schemes.  The question is about quality part-time options.<\/p> <p>  Another key issue that relates to this is the concern around the invisible, that is, those who have a disability but because disability allowance is means-tested may not be on disability allowance and, moving away from the payments, their access to the educational, the training and the employment supports.  That is what I was talking about in terms of there being suitable good quality options.  Are they available to people, regardless what payment scheme they are on, and to those who may not be on a payment scheme but who may have a disability?<\/p> <p>  The other witnesses might answer my question on what we heard about the iterative process because there is a real concern here.  Disability is one of the issues that has not landed suddenly; it is one of the most known issues.  We know it is a long-term fact of society and yet it seems there is a huge reliance on pilot schemes.<\/p><p>JobPath, for example, scaled up very quickly and yet we have had a litany of excellent practice schemes which seem to have come and gone.  WALK PEER was mentioned as was the three-year funding.  Is it national?  Is it available everywhere?  There is the Care project and the Inclusive Learning Project at Maynooth University, about which we heard great things but then the funding stopped.  There is also the Career Pathways, a transition to employment scheme in Trinity College.  There is a litany of excellent good-practice schemes.  However, what seems to happen is that the pilots are put in place but then the scale-up does not happen.  I am very concerned about a new project, namely, the pilot project testing the policy approach for a comprehensive supported employment programme.  This is just another example, which will be a pilot from 2018 to 2020, and will provide learning for any future scaling of such an approach.

That is giving Intreo offices a much greater visibility as to the full range of education and training offerings that are out there where previously most of the referrals would have been to the training side because the employment and training side were together in F&Aacute;S at one point.  That includes quite a lot of part-time provision - for example, the back to education initiative and a range of programmes at various levels, including in areas like literacy, numeracy, digital skills and basic skills.<\/p><p> More broadly, in further education, training and, indeed, higher education, there is a major push to increase the range of flexible options available.  Members will be aware of the Springboard programme, for example.  Springboard was previously heavily pushed towards people who were unemployed, were on jobseeker's assistance or benefit but now it has been opened up much more broadly and provides good options, including for people in employment, which may include people with disability.  There has been a considerable push and some funding through the higher education funding mechanisms, through the Higher Education Authority, and also in further education, through SOLAS, on technology-enhanced learning, with blended approaches.  That is through both the use of technology in classrooms, which is something that can be very important to people with disabilities, and also online, with blended approaches which deliver greater flexibility.  It is reasonable to say that those protocols have been in place for two years for Intreo offices and ourselves.<\/p><p> Our Department, SOLAS and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection regularly meet on a tripartite basis to review how that is working locally.  As the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection broadens its focus more clearly beyond people who are unemployed - and some capacity maybe has freed up in Intreo services - our Department also needs to look at how we can support the broader range of clients that are likely to come our way.  That is a focus of our discussions too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#T01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phil O'Flaherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":919,"content":"<p>My apologies for being absent for quite a long time.  I had to attend another meeting.  It is very difficult when two meetings are being held at the same time.<\/p> <p>.  I welcome our guests.  I have a couple of quick comments.  Something that has become obvious to me and, I am sure, everybody in public life is that families that are affected by disability spend much of the time waiting for something to happen, waiting for services to kick in or waiting for attention.  It has become a burden to them with the anxiety that is attached.  Can the Departments do anything to try to eliminate that?  For example, why should children with special needs of an acute nature have to wait indefinitely for urgent surgical procedures?  These families have to wait a long time and they do not know when an outcome will be forthcoming<\/p> <p>   The burden on families has to be experienced by means having close contact with the families.  These people will readily relate the facts.  The mother of a teenager who has a serious disability recently informed me that she has been at it for 20 years, day and night and on call all the time.  She said that some things are well done and some are not; that sometimes provision was made and sometimes it was not.  Certain families have more than one member with a disability and that increases the burden.  I would like the service providers to bear that in mind when they refer to waiting.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the disability allowance versus the invalidity pension, the former is insurance-based but there was a tradition whereby a person, a year from coming off a disability allowance, particularly when coming off a domiciliary care allowance, automatically qualified for an invalidity pension.  This does not happen any more.  That is a huge disadvantage to people who may have a limited income and who may find themselves in a difficult position.  Any extra money is a huge advantage to them.<\/p><p>That needs to be looked at again.<\/p><p> This is important and I do not want an answer to it.  It is a comment.  Some people can overcome disability to a huge extent, whether a physical disability or a sensory disability.  Others cannot.  Others may find the disability so overpowering, whether inherited or a disability following an accident, that they find themselves at a huge physical and psychological disadvantage and feel unable to cope, and feel very pressurised, as I saw at a recent case where it was suggested that an amputee should seek employment.  It was an appalling decision.  I cannot understand how an official or anybody could stand over a decision like that.  The simple reason was the unfortunate person was at a very severe physical disadvantage to start with and, to overcome that physical disability mentally, in itself, was a huge issue for him.  To suggest to the person concerned that he should be looking for a job and there was no reason he should not get a job is crazy.<\/p><p> The Intreo people have been referred to.  The jury is still out on that for me.  They have done some interesting and useful work but they have also gone off on a tangent on some occasions where a little more thought could have gone into what eventually became a decision and a burden on the people affected by that decision.  I am not asking for answers.  I am making a comment.  I have serious concerns about the things I have mentioned because I have daily contact with people who are affected in that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#U00200","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I will come back to the Deputy in a moment.  I want to be fair to the witnesses we had here a couple of weeks ago.  I will make a couple of comments and they can be referred to specifically.  I reflected on it before I came in.  Something the witnesses all said collectively was that they felt lucky about where they have got to.  Despite all the programmes and policies we have in place, they all felt lucky to have worked through the system and for their entitlements.  They all came by different pathways but there was an element of luck.  That was the way they felt about it and, in that way, there is something wrong with the system in that there are not clearer, more identifiable pathways onto which those people or their advocates can see them.  They all referred to it as luck.  I was very taken with it.  The witnesses have quite rightly explained a significant range of programmes that are available but the people who are to avail of them do not see it as easily as that.  Information and education are issues.<\/p> <p>  I will address a couple of specifics that the individuals referred to, in no particular order.  One lady spoke about what she was able to do because she had a personal assistant.  She was a little bit older and had the personal assistant for some time, but she made the point that if she was a younger person, she would not have access in the same way that she does.  She recognised the old system versus the new system and was quite specific in it.  We had one person who spoke about special needs assistants and their support in primary, secondary and third level.  There was no continuity of support.  There was a significant drop-off in second level and they were quite impressed with the level of support they got in third level.<\/p> <p>  We heard about the special schools and the fact that, in many of them, there is no pathway either to do the leaving certificate or applied leaving certificate, and what that means for those people in the future.  Mr. Mulkerrins alluded to the fact that careers guidance in those special schools is not done in the normal way, as it would be done in a regular school.  These were highlighted.  Everyone expressed concern about the loss of the medical card or the travel pass.  They all said to us in different ways that, while they might have a job, they still have their disability and the associated costs that go with it.<\/p><p>While they might have a job, the people concerned still have disabilities and face associated costs.  We need to look at more than just means testing.  One of the delegates is visually impaired.  Some of the equipment covered by the medical card scheme is relatively expensive and she faced a huge personal burden.  When the transition is considered in the round, people with disabilities face additional costs in getting to work.  There is a feeling of nervousness and vulnerability in losing the medical card and free travel.  <\/p><p> There was much talk about the disability allowance and illness benefit.  I understand there are approximately 2,500 in receipt of partial capacity benefit.  It was rightly set out that the person was assessed.  My experience of partial capacity benefit is that many persons who are availing of it and have re-entered the workforce do not have a regular weekly salary because many do not work full time.  The partial capacity benefit does not recognise whether a person has worked in a given week.  Such persons are on a reduced payment, in comparison to the previous benefit of which they availed.  We should look at the benefit specifically for those who are beginning to go back to work where the nature of the work is part time or casual or for a few hours a week.  That is the stepping stone for them, but partial capacity benefit is only for a set amount, irrespective of what a person earns in a given week.  I suggest a system be put in place to provides the full benefit if a person has not worked in a given week for a specified period of time.  For many, it is a transition.  <\/p><p> My colleagues will speak briefly about this issue, but they are the main points.  I am taken by the reports and the actions proposed for the future, but I emphasise that the delegates who were here a couple of weeks ago all said they were lucky.  They had all transitioned and were making progress in their lives.  However, there was a feeling there was no clear stepping stone or that another person could follow exactly what they had done.  There was a feeling those who had transitioned had met the right person at the right time or had been on the right programme at the right time.  I was taken when I heard the delegates say that they had got lucky.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#V00200","speaker":"1298","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":923,"content":"<p>I was struck by what was said about technology in assisted learning.

There were some strong recommendations for an overhaul in that area, particularly in the use of technology and in terms of how important it is.  This applies not only to the provision of reasonable accommodation for those in work but also to the provision of reasonable accommodation in applying for work.  One of the people who spoke mentioned the obstacles faced in merely applying for work.  The update on that aspect was important.<\/p> <p>  In terms of SNAs and personal assistants, the question of autonomy and choice arose, as well as questions about the hours and quality of support available.

This matter needs to be investigated further, but I am confident that it is going to happen in the next couple of months.<\/p> <p>  We all agree with Deputy Durkan on his point about families waiting for services and assessments for whom this is particularly traumatic, especially those with children with special needs who are then going for acute services.  I was only made aware recently that there are disability liaison nurses in the major acute hospitals, so those processes for a child with a disability requiring acute services can be streamlined.  That is a positive.<\/p> <p>  No one disputes the huge burden families face.  This year, as part of the Estimates for 2018, the Government allowed an extra &euro;10 million to provide extra respite services.  It is a drop in the ocean, but it helps provide an extra respite house in each community healthcare organisation, CHO, area.  This is having a positive impact throughout the country, and we would hope to build on that next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#X00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Patsy Carr"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1528801200,"counter":934,"content":"<p>I will make three points, if I may.  The first is a general point that I imagine reflects all of our views.  The Department of Education and Skills accepts that while it has provision and policies for support in place, individual experiences may not necessarily reflect that.  We are aware that individual experiences are less than satisfactory, and it makes it all the more important that we have opportunities to come to committees to hear about individual experiences.  We also hear about such experiences through parliamentary questions and representations as well.  We are very conscious of it, and it affords us an opportunity to try to modify our arrangements to make the individual experiences better.<\/p> <p>  On the second point, I read some of the presentations that were made at earlier meetings about special needs assistants, SNAs, the experiences of one particular person at primary, secondary and third level, and the drop-off in the service that person experienced at second level.  I was somewhat surprised by that individual example, because if I recall the case correctly the drop-off occurred during leaving certificate year.  I was surprised to hear that because we operate a policy, between ourselves and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that when an SNA allocation is reviewed, unless there was absolute clarity that the individual need had diminished substantially, there would be no removal of that level of support in the final year.  I suspect that was an individual example of something falling through the gaps.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure when this happened, but I would make the point that between 2001 and 2010, the number of SNAs in the system grew by approximately 1,000 every year.  There was a period of cooling off between 2010 and 2013, largely because of the economic downturn, I suspect.  However, we continued to make additional provision.  By the end of this year there will be 15,000 SNAs in the system.  A person attending school ten years ago may not have had the same level of access to SNA support as one would get now.  We recognise that the levels of need have not changed greatly in the intervening years.  The levels of assessed understanding of what those needs are has changed very substantially.<\/p><p>All of those needs existed in pupil populations ten, 20 and 30 years ago.  We just were not supporting them the way we should have done, or in the way we now understand we needed to do.  <\/p><p> Two points were raised about special schools, the first was about pathways to leaving certificate and applied leaving certificate.  The committee knows that we have introduced levels 1 and 2 and there have been significant improvements in terms of accreditation for pupils.  It is important that students' performance and abilities are recognised.  In respect of the leaving certificate and applied leaving certificate there is a discussion between us and the National Council for Special Education which takes the lead in providing us with policy advice, having conducted research and consultation in the sector, about how we need to consider provision for special schools in the future.  There is a discussion about getting the balance right.  We recognise that there will always be children who will require the supports of special schools but who will have the capacity to go on and do leaving cert and applied leaving cert.  That, unfortunately, is not the case for the majority.  The issue is what the appropriate provision would be for pupils who are attending special schools but have aspirations to go on and do leaving cert applied and the ordinary leaving cert.  It is a matter of getting the balance between where provision should be made, whether children should be provided with greater levels of access, even part-time, perhaps in the mainstream or access to a special class with transition to mainstream for appropriate subjects and whether the needs are such that they require special schools.  That is a challenge we face and we hope to be able to improve our consideration of that over the coming year.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018061200002#X00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Mulkerrins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528801200,"counter":936,"content":"<p>That concludes today's meeting.
