Since then I also attended the European Council meeting in Ypres and Brussels on 26 and 27 June.  I reported to the House on the outcomes of that Council in a comprehensive statement on 2 July.  While I did not have any separate bilateral meetings with PM Cameron at either meeting I did, of course, see him and all of my colleagues at both meetings.<\/p><p>The agenda for the June meeting of the European Council was prepared in the normal way.  President Van Rompuy prepared an annotated draft agenda. This was considered by the General Affairs Council on 13 May which was attended by Minister of State Donohoe.  <\/p><p>President Van Rompuy then circulated Draft Conclusions for the June European Council, which were discussed by Ambassadors and senior officials in Brussels and by Ministers at the meeting of the General Affairs Council, attended by Minister of State Donohoe, on 24 June.   In the usual manner, at each step in the process, Ireland contributed views, as appropriate.<\/p><p>The meeting of Heads of State and Government on 27 May took place shortly after the European Parliament elections and leaders discussed the results, including those of extremist parties.  At that meeting we also discussed the process for the election of the new President of the European Commission and tasked President Van Rompuy to consult with the presidents of the new political groups, and to report back.  This led to the nomination, which I welcomed, of Jean Claude Juncker at the June European Council.<\/p><p>The selection process for the President of the European Council is determined by Article 15 (5) of the Treaty on European Union which states that the European Council shall elect its President, by a qualified majority, for a term of two and a half years, renewable once.<\/p><p>The term of office of the current President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, ends on 30 November 2014. The European Council is convening tomorrow, 16 July to discuss a number of high level key appointments.<\/p><p>At our May meeting, Heads of State and Government also had an initial discussion on the Union's future priorities and strategic agenda for the period ahead. There was general agreement that we must maintain the focus on growth and jobs.  This important discussion was continued at the June European Council and led to the adoption of a strategic agenda for the EU for the coming period.<\/p><p>The Strategic Agenda identifies the priorities which will guide the work of the European Union over the next five years.  These cover: (1) jobs, growth and competitiveness, (2) empowering and protecting all EU citizens, (3) energy and climate policy, (4) freedom, security and justice, and (5) the EU's external relations.  The agenda forms part of the Conclusions adopted by the June European Council and are a public document. Overall I am pleased that the Strategic Agenda reflects a clear commitment to strengthening the economic recovery across Europe. <\/p><p><b><i>Ukraine<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>We discussed Ukraine at the meeting of Heads of State and Government in May and again at the June European Council.  Although there have been some positive developments in recent weeks &ndash; not least the Presidential elections, and the announcement of a peace plan together with a ceasefire by President Poroshenko on 20 June &ndash; we remain very concerned about the situation in eastern Ukraine.  <\/p><p>At the June European Council leaders called for several steps to be taken, including agreement on a verification mechanism, monitored by the OSCE, for the ceasefire and for effective control of the border; the return to the Ukrainian authorities of three border checkpoints; the release of hostages including all of the OSCE observers; and the launch of substantial negotiations on the implementation of President Poroshenko's peace plan. We also urged the Russian Federation to actively use its influence over illegally armed groups, and to stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border with Ukraine, in order to achieve rapid and tangible results in de-escalation. <\/p><p>In the meantime, there have been contacts between the Foreign Ministers of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine with a view to restoring peace and stability in Ukraine, and they have adopted a Joint Declaration reconfirming their commitment to that objective. <\/p><p>Ireland supports their efforts.<\/p><p><b><i>Direct Bank Recapitalisation.<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>Deputies as you are aware, the Euro-area Heads of State and Government agreed in June 2012 that &quot;it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns&quot;, and that when a Single Supervisory Mechanism, involving the ECB, is in place and operational, the European Stability Mechanism, the ESM, could recapitalise banks directly. <\/p><p>On 10 June 2014 the euro area Member States reached a preliminary agreement on the operational framework for the ESM&rsquo;s Direct Recapitalisation Instrument. This includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument. Therefore, the agreement, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it. <\/p><p><b><i>Berlin Visit<\/i><\/b><\/p><p>In terms of recent political contacts with European partners, I visited Berlin on 3 July for a programme of economic and trade promotion engagements, during which I met with Chancellor Merkel. This programme included a networking event at the Embassy of Ireland with clients of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Bord Bia as well as members of the Global Irish Network. I also participated at the formal opening of a new Primark store in Berlin, the Irish group&rsquo;s 13<sup>th<\/sup>store in its expanding network in Germany.<\/p><p>My programme concluded with a speech at the opening session of the annual economic conference of the Wirtschaftsrat Economic Council, entitled &ldquo;Real Recovery, Sustainable Jobs and Lasting Growth &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s story and Europe&rsquo;s next steps&rdquo;. My speech set out the progress of Ireland&rsquo;s recovery so far, drawing attention to the sacrifices of the Irish people and to the remaining fragilities in our economy including debt-related issues. I outlined my priorities for an action-focused EU agenda for the years ahead while also setting out the advantages of trading with Ireland given the presence of a large number of major German employers in the audience.  <\/p><p>Chancellor Merkel participated at the same session of this conference, prior to which we met together to discuss current European issues and the Irish economy. The main focus of our discussion was tomorrows European Council, which will deal with the ongoing situation in the Ukraine and the remaining appointments to high-level positions in the EU institutions following the nomination of Jean-Claude Juncker as Commission President. <\/p><p>We discussed the Irish economy and in that context I pointed to ongoing progress with the completion of Banking Union, in particular the recent provisional agreement reached among EU Finance Ministers on the operational framework for the European Stability Mechanism&rsquo;s Direct Recapitalisation Instrument. As I have already stated, this is a further important step in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s legacy banking debt.<\/p><p>Chancellor  Merkel and I also discussed the strong progress made on our previous agreement regarding the investment by the KfW (Kreditanstalt f&uuml;r Wiederaufbau), Germany&rsquo;s state-owned development bank, in the new Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI). The SBCI will provide over &euro;500million in new credit to be made available to Irish SMEs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500052#WRA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":23,"content":"<p>Question No. 25 resubmitted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":24,"content":"<p>Question No. 26 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":25,"content":"<p>Question No. 27 resubmitted.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500052#WRA02350"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[19970\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500052#WRA02400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the last meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Health was held.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[19971\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500052#WRA02500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Health that have been held since the start of 2014.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[24136\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500052#WRA02600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of times the Cabinet Committee on Health has met since the EU and local Government elections.","asker":"1066","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","counter":30,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[25455\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500052#WRA02700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of times the Cabinet Committee on Health has met since the May elections.","asker":null,"askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":31,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 to 31, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Cabinet Committee on Health has met five times since the start of 2014 with the last meeting held on 30 June.

The aim of my visit was to help cement and reinforce existing investor relationships, as well as build new connections, with a view to securing new jobs and investment for Ireland, and supporting exporting Irish firms and entrepreneurs.  Throughout the visit, I emphasised  the progress we have made towards economic recovery and highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s strengths as a location for investment and high-potential start-ups and ambitious entrepreneurs.  <\/p><p>  I visited the headquarters of a number of companies, including some of the most significant multi-national companies located in Ireland who, between them, employ close to 16,000 people here.  The companies I visited included:  Apple, Hewlett Packard, eBay, LinkedIn, Facebook, Tesla Motors, Google, CISCO, Yelp, Workday, New Relic, PCH International, and AirBnB.   I also met representatives from Boeing, Cubic Telecom and Voxpro.   <\/p><p>  During my visit, I also opened the Enterprise Ireland Access Silicon Valley event, and met with the representatives of companies participating in the programme.  This programme assists Irish companies in breaking into the US market and partnering with US firms. I had the opportunity to meet exporting Irish companies who have recently secured significant contracts with US partners located in California.<\/p><p>  I also addressed an event organised by IDA Ireland for its client companies and prospective investors in Ireland.  My programme also included a meeting with representatives of the Global Irish Network based in the West Coast area. Ambassador Anderson and Consul General Grant jointly hosted an event at the United Irish Cultural Center in San Francisco, where I met members of the Irish community and local GAA clubs. I had a brief opportunity to meet the Mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Ed Lee, in the margins of this event.<\/p><p>  I also met with the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, during my visit.  Our discussions focused on strengthening the strong economic, trade, investment and tourism links between Ireland and California. Naturally, I raised the issue of undocumented Irish immigrants and the prospect of immigration reform in the US in this discussion.  <\/p><p>  Governor Brown is a strong champion of immigration reform and has introduced a number of progressive legislative Bills at State level in California aimed at improving conditions for the undocumented in California.  <\/p><p>  Since my own U.S. visit and that by then T&aacute;naiste Eamon Gilmore to Washington D.C. to engage with key political and community leaders on the issue, political controversy has arisen in the U.S. Congress in relation to unaccompanied migrant children from Central America \u00a0who are seeking to enter the United States via its southern border. This has impacted negatively on the prospects for wider immigration reform legislation being achieved over the period ahead. On June 30, President Obama announced that he intends to address certain immediate immigration-related matters via his executive powers within existing U.S. law. <\/p><p>  I must stress that this issue remains a very important focus for this Government. The extent and nature of any action that the U.S. Administration will be ready to take remains to be seen.\u00a0 The legal terrain involved is highly complex and there is clearly no guarantee as to the outcome that can be achieved for Ireland&rsquo;s interests.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  We are continuing to press our case at all levels through Ambassador Anderson and her Embassy team in Washington D.C. and the Irish American community groups with whom they are working closely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500052#WRA05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":66,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 55 to 57, inclusive, resubmitted.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[29233\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500052#WRA06000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will provide an update on the recent meeting of the British Irish Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>I attended the 22nd British-Irish Council (BIC) Summit hosted by Chief Minister, Jonathon Le Tocq, in Guernsey on 13 June 2014.

Since the lowest point of the jobs crisis, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of over 15% to 11.6% at present.    The latest QNHS figures show that the number of long-term unemployed has fallen from 204,000 (9.5%) in the first quarter of 2012 to 156,000 (7.3%) in the same period this year.  The number of unemployed young people has fallen from 64,000 (29.7%) to 47,500 (25.3%) over the same period. The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to reduce unemployment has been through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  This strategy is working.

To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.

The revised estimates for the Department of Social Protection provide for expenditure of &euro;3.3bn in 2014 in respect of the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes.  Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009.

To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.5%).<\/p><p>  Self-employed workers may access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.<\/p><p>  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. <\/p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500053#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Internship Scheme Administration","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500053#WRB02950"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[30870\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500053#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"in view of the NESC finding that 23% of households are underemployed, which is more than twice the EU average, if she is concerned that the JobBridge scheme may be exacerbating the underemployment crisis; if her Department has researched the link between the availability of free labour via the JobBridge scheme and the poverty of hours crisis in certain sectors; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>I am satisfied that JobBridge is not exacerbating under-employment.

Legally, the Exchequer is the residual financier of the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and Exchequer contributions were the norm for over 40 years.  For example, in 1967, the State contribution was 38% of SIF expenditure; and almost 29% in 1985.  However, no Exchequer contribution was required over the period 1997 to 2007 inclusive when social insurance income exceeded Fund expenditure.  In 2008, the current operating balance of the SIF moved into deficit with expenditure exceeding income by &euro;255m.  This deficit accelerated in 2009 when it reached &euro;2.49 billion and further rose to &euro;2.75 billion in 2010.  This resulted in the requirement for an Exchequer subvention in 2010 as the accumulated surplus was exhausted and this requirement will continue (in the absence of revenue raising measures).  The Revised Estimates provides for a subvention of &euro;0.69 billion from voted expenditure to fund the deficit on the SIF in 2014. The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund as at 31 December, 2010, highlighted the growing deficit in the Fund and the prospect that it will, in the absence of measures to address the deficit, accelerate further in the future, driven primarily by pension costs.  It is estimated that in excess of &euro;900m additional provision will be required over the next 5 years to fund increases in the numbers of recipients of the State pension (contributory) scheme.   The Programme for Government commitment is to retain core weekly social welfare rates of payment.  This Government has successfully achieved this objective over the last three Budgets.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware persons in self-employment who pay class S PRSI are entitled to access a range of long-term social insurance benefits which are funded from the SIF, including State pension (contributory).  <\/p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. <\/p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. <\/p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person. <\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500054#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Income Supplement Payments","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500054#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[30928\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500054#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to raise the living standards of low income families within her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>The Revised Estimates Volume for 2014 provides for expenditure of &euro;19.6 billion by the Department of Social Protection on schemes, services and administration.  The vast majority of this expenditure goes on weekly income support payments as well as monthly child benefit payments.     The Department currently provides income support to over 1.4 million recipients each week. When increases for qualified adults and children are included, more than 2.2 million directly benefit each week.  These weekly payments have been fully maintained over the past three years in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. <\/p><p>In addition to the weekly rates of payment, child benefit is paid to over 600,000 families each month, in respect of almost 1.2 million children.  The Department also provides a wide range of supplementary payments and some benefits in kind. <\/p><p>The immediate impact of these payments, known as social transfers, is to reduce poverty.  In 2012, CSO data shows that social transfers reduced the at-risk-of poverty rate from 50.3 per cent (before social transfers) to 16.5 per cent (after social transfers, including pensions), a &lsquo;poverty reduction effect&rsquo; of 67.2 per cent.  If pensions are excluded, the reduction is from 39 per cent to 16.5 per cent, or 57.7 per cent in relative terms.

There are approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. I do not intend to abolish the rent supplement maximum rent limits.  However, a review of the maximum rent limits has commenced and will feed into the budgetary process.  This review involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of external sources, including the Private Residential Tenancies Board, in addition to seeking the views from a number of stakeholders including staff, relevant Departments and Agencies and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul.    Prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, particularly in urban areas, are finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties. <\/p><p>  The Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.

Ensuring that Northern Ireland's institutions deliver for its people is a challenge that requires leadership and constructive engagement in the face of complex, contentious issues.  When the Taoiseach spoke with Prime Minister Cameron last week, both leaders underlined their support for the Good Friday Agreement institutions, as well as calling for dialogue and calm during the marching season.

The new election observation roster was established in May 2013 following a review of the existing roster.  It comprises 200 individuals with a strong mix of skills and experience relevant to election monitoring.  Applicants for the roster were scored independently by two assessors external to the Department, against four criteria specifically related to election observation.  These were: experience of election observation; knowledge of human rights and\/or governance issues; language skills; and experience of challenging environments.  <\/p><p>  For each election observation mission, the EU or OSCE set out their specific requirements and, on the basis of expressions of interest from roster members, the Department draws up a list of eligible observers.

Israel stated that a Hamas unit in Hebron had abducted and murdered the three Israeli youths, and arrested large numbers of Hamas operatives in the West Bank, both before and after the youths were found to have been killed. Israeli military forces also struck a number of Hamas targets in Gaza.<\/p><p>  This situation has quickly escalated, and the current large scale violence around Gaza, while originating in these incidents, has taken on a terrible life of its own.  An estimated 800 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv and West Jerusalem, and at the nuclear reactor at Dimona.  Israel in response has carried out some 1300 air strikes on Gaza.  While these are stated to be aimed at missile launchers and other targets associated with Hamas and other militant groups, as is always the case the resultant casualties, now estimated at approximately 190 dead in Gaza, include large numbers of civilians.<\/p><p>  Israel has stated that it seeks what it calls &quot;quiet for quiet&quot;, that is, a resumption of the truce which has largely held since November 2012.  The attitude of Hamas is less clear, but it seems uninterested for the moment in a ceasefire.  It may be that, have been weakened in a number of ways in recent months, it is seeking to reassert its standing in a military confrontation with Israel.  It is however the ordinary people, especially of Gaza but also of Israel, who suffer the cost of these events.<\/p><p>  Our position is clear.  This violence &ndash; in both directions &ndash; is not acceptable.  Since taking office I have repeated the clear call of my predecessor for an end to firing by both sides, and a restoration of the truce.  All Israelis, and all Palestinians, have the right to live in peace and security without this constant threat of violence.  I welcome the proposal by the Government of Egypt providing for an early ceasefire to come into effect, and note the statement by Israel that it would accept this proposal. I very much hope this initiative will succeed.<\/p><p>  High Representative Ashton has made similar calls on behalf of the EU, as have many of my EU colleagues.  Foreign Minister Steinmeier of Germany and Foreign Minister Mogherini of Italy are due to visit the region in the coming days for discussions with Israeli and Palestinian leaders.

The Foreign Affairs Council on 22 July was already scheduled to discuss the Middle East Peace Process and will certainly now consider this upsurge in violence.

Human rights have been a priority of successive Irish governments, and are a key dimension of our foreign policy. Ireland works bilaterally and through the EU and UN to ensure that human rights are respected in Myanmar\/Burma.  In June 2014 the EU Delegation to Myanmar and EU Heads of Mission visited Nay Pyi Taw for political consultations with the Myanmar Government, including Union Ministers of the President's Office, and the Deputy Foreign Minister.  They also met with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  <\/p><p>  At the EU Foreign Affairs Council in May 2014, EU Foreign Ministers approved the establishment of a formal EU-Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue.  The first such Dialogue took place in Myanmar on 20th May.  It was co-chaired by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights and the Myanmar Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and covered major issues of concern with regard to human rights, including discrimination, hate speech and inter-communal violence against the Rohingya in Rakhine, and in other parts of Myanmar.  At the dialogue the EU stressed that continued efforts to achieve ethnic peace and end discrimination and violence in Rakhine State were key for the success of Myanmar's continued transition to democracy.  The EU encouraged the Myanmar government to address the underlying causes of inter-communal violence, including the status and welfare of the Rohingya and expressed regret that Rohingya could not self-identify during the recent census.  The EU also expressed readiness to cooperate with Myanmar on initiatives which promote inter-communal understanding.<\/p><p>  In April 2014, Ireland was involved in organising with several NGOs an event at UN Headquarters in New York that focused on sexual violence in Myanmar.  It featured interventions from a Burmese woman human rights activist, Naw K'nyaw Paw, and Ireland's Permanent Representative to the UN, David Donoghue.<\/p><p>  In March 2014, the UN Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member, adopted an EU-led resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, which urged the Government of Myanmar to step up its efforts to put an end to remaining human rights violations and abuses.  In particular, the Council reiterated its serious concern about the situation of the Rohingya and other minorities in Rakhine State, including repeated instances of violence and other reported abuses, requested that an independent investigation be undertaken into those events and that those responsible be held to account.  <\/p><p>  Officials from my Department met with Burma Action Ireland, the Chairman of the European Rohingya Council and a member of the Irish Rohingya Community earlier this month to listen to their concerns and to brief on the Irish Government's actions in relation to Myanmar.  Ireland's (non-resident) Ambassador to Myanmar met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Myanmar during a visit to the country in May 2014.  The Ambassador raised Ireland's ongoing concerns about the situation in Rakhine State, including the poor conditions that the some 140,000 displaced Rohingya people are enduring in the IDP camps, and the lack of humanitarian access, given that many international NGOs have been forced to leave Rakhine State.  <\/p><p>  The Ambassador also visited Rakhine State in September 2013.  The purpose of the visit was to assess the humanitarian situation on the ground, particularly for the displaced members of the Muslim Rohingya community and to assess whether there are any areas where Ireland could offer support to help alleviate their plight.  The Ambassador visited several IDP camps, called on the Chief Minister of Rakhine state, met with local Buddhist religious leaders, and had discussions with the heads of the main UN agencies working on the ground.<\/p><p>  Since 2007, Ireland has provided more than &euro;7.87 million to Myanmar through NGOs and Irish missionaries for both long term development work and emergency and recovery responses.  In July 2013, officials from my Department undertook a scoping visit to Myanmar\/Burma.  The purpose of the mission was to assess developments in the country, and examine how Irish Aid could develop an assistance programme for the country.  The visit encompassed a wide range of meetings with political, business, diplomatic and civil society contacts.  The range of meetings allowed a broad assessment of developments in the country and to identify key elements of a possible aid programme.<\/p><p>  On foot of this scoping visit, in December 2013, the T&aacute;naiste announced an additional programme of funding of &euro;500, 000 for a bilateral development assistance programme in 2013.  The same level of funding has also been agreed for 2014.  Irish Aid also granted funding of &euro;425,825 to Tr&oacute;caire in 2014 under the Humanitarian Programme Plan for Food Security, Livelihood and Protection assistance programme in Laiza, Kachin State, Myanmar.<\/p><p>  The Ambassador to Myanmar also visited Kachin state in Upper Burma in March 2013, as part of a field trip by EU Ambassadors accredited to Myanmar.  The purpose of the trip was to visit IDP camps to assess the situation of those displaced by fighting in Kachin state; to get an update on efforts to broker a ceasefire agreement between the Government and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA); and to meet with local government, NGOs (including a number of Irish missionaries) and UN agencies to discuss how the EU can best assist in peace efforts and humanitarian relief.<\/p><p>  Ireland and our international partners recognise that complex challenges remain in Myanmar and will continue to urge its government to address human rights abuses.  We will continue to press for the Myanmar government to implement its commitment to open a local country office of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights which would have a mandate for monitoring and reporting on human rights issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500056#WRE01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500056#WRE01950"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[31128\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500056#WRE02000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when his Department will publish its annual report for 2013.","asker":"1100","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>My Department intends to publish its annual report for 2013 by October this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500056#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft Landings","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500056#WRE02150"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[31164\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500056#WRE02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"how far in advance requests for military aircraft to land or overfly Irish airspace are required; and if assurances are sought or given on every single occasion they are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, do not engage in intelligence gathering, and where the flights in question do not form any part of military exercises or operations.

Africa Day Family Days, incorporating musical entertainment, cultural activities and an African Bazaar, were hosted by the Department at the Farmleigh Estate in 2013 and 2014. <\/p><p>In recent years the Department has helped broaden coverage of global development themes and of the countries with which Irish Aid works through support to the Simon Cumbers Media Fund.  Other media initiatives include co-funding of the RTE Radio Series 'One World' in 2013 to allow for a more consistent and integrated approach to coverage of development issues on the national broadcaster.  The Department also provides grant funding to support the 'What in the World' television series, produced by KMF Productions, and broadcast on RTE television.  Figures for the costs associated with these initiatives are contained in the following table.<\/p><p>My Department avails of the services of external photographic agencies where it is warranted, in particular, for major events and State occasions.  This is a service which my Department provides so that the media can easily and freely avail of photography where their own staff photographers cannot be fully accommodated.  In the case of Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2013, there was a demand for photography which would not routinely apply.  My Department continues to make greater use of in-house resources for photography.<\/p><p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.  The total communication costs for 2014 are expected to be broadly in line with 2013.

Court fees orders are made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. \u00a0During 2013, the Courts Service carried out a comprehensive review of court fees.  Court fees in connection with bankruptcy proceedings are currently regulated by the Supreme and High Court (Fees) Order 2014 (S.I. 24 of 2014) which came into effect on 3 February 2014.<\/p><p>  The fees comprise &euro;190 payable on the petition for bankruptcy and &euro;20 payable on the verifying affidavit.\u00a0 As the Deputy will appreciate, court fee income forms a significant part of the funding for the general operation of the courts and the Courts Service keeps its fee structure under continuous review in accordance with the power given to it under the Courts Service Act.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has no plans to reduce the fees payable under S.I. 24 of 2014.  However, the operation of the law in this area is kept under review by her Department. <\/p><p>  In addition, the Minister for Justice and Equality asks that the Deputy should note that fees are also payable to the Insolvency Service of Ireland during administration of a bankruptcy as set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 (Prescribed fees in Bankruptcy Matters) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 465 of 2013).  These fees are similarly kept under review.  The law relating to bankruptcy was already changed in 2013 (by the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013) to reduce the costs of bankruptcy for debtors by providing that the necessary publication could be made without charge on the website of the Insolvency Service, rather than by advertisements in national newspapers.  The resulting saving for a person wishing to become bankrupt was estimated at up to &euro;500.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p><p>  With regard to eliminating the VAT on court fees, I would point out that fees charged by the Court service are not within the scope of VAT.\u00a0 Therefore, VAT should not apply to such fees.\u00a0 I would however point out that VAT does apply to the services of all insolvency practitioners, including the activities carried out by liquidators, receivers, examiners and personal insolvency practitioners (PIPs) involved in the debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements as provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.\u00a0 The fees charged by insolvency practitioners are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.\u00a0 The Revenue Commissioners have considered in the past the nature of the services provided by PIPs and concluded that the services provided by a PIP do not qualify for exemption in accordance with the VAT Directive, Irish VAT Law, and relevant decisions of the European Court of Justice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500056#WRE04500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Insurance Cover","counter":323,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500056#WRE04550"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[30767\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500056#WRE04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to insurance companies refusing home insurance, including but not limited to flood insurance,  to householders in Dublin based on a supposed risk of flooding, even though there is no history or projected risk of flooding in the area in question.

However, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland,\u00a0have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals.  The provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the need to make adequate provisioning to meet these risks.\u00a0 As a matter of course, insurance companies carry out reviews of the risks they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make decisions to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk.  Insurance Ireland has indicated that 98% of policyholders have household insurance which includes flood cover.<\/p><p>Government policy in relation to flooding is focussed on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.\u00a0\u00a0The Office of Public Works (OPW)\u00a0is carrying out an assessment of flood risk throughout the country under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.\u00a0 This programme will include the\u00a0 production of a comprehensive suite of flood risk maps and the development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk.\u00a0 The plans will consider the best possible options, both structural and non-structural, for dealing with the risks on a long-term basis. \u00a0 <\/p><p>This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.  Works are completed on a prioritised basis.\u00a0 Because of the cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, this approach will see benefits over the medium and long term.<\/p><p>The OPW and Insurance Ireland have agreed on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes.  The outcome of this arrangement is that the insurance industry will have a much greater level of information and understanding of the extent of the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence works and will therefore be able to reflect this in assessing the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed.<\/p><p>The Deputy has raised the issue of flood insurance in the Dublin.\u00a0 The OPW has been involved in a number of flood relief projects in various parts of Dublin.\u00a0 The River Tolka scheme is completed and details of\u00a0the completed works have been provided to Insurance Ireland.\u00a0 Work is continuing on the River\u00a0Dodder and River Wad schemes and work will begin soon on the\u00a0River Poddle scheme. <\/p><p>My Department is\u00a0undertaking a review of measures which could be taken to\u00a0increase the availability of flood insurance cover, including the past experience and future\u00a0proposals in other countries.\u00a0 In assessing these, care has to be taken that the proposed solutions do not put in place arrangements which, over time, would weaken the provision of commercial insurance cover by the market with possible negative long-term consequences for the economy.<\/p><p>I am advised that in cases where individuals\u00a0are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.

Furthermore, in the context of non-life insurance, the EU framework provides non-life insurers with the freedom to set premiums, as has been acknowledged in case law by the European Court of Justice (Case C-518\/06). In this regard, Member States may not\u00a0require non-life insurance undertakings to make prior notification or seek prior approval of proposed increases in premium rates, except as part of a general price-control system. <\/p><p>The Central Bank does not regulate premiums in the insurance market. Insurance companies consider a number of risks when determining the premium for a proposed insurance policy, whether that is a general insurance policy such as motor or home insurance, or a life assurance policy. A premium is based on the actuarial calculation of risk. For example, a consumer with penalty points may be subject to a higher premium on motor insurance than a consumer with no penalty points. Similarly the claims history of the consumer seeking the insurance is considered. An increase in claims in the geographical location of the asset to be insured can also impact on the premium cost.<\/p><p>Consumers are encouraged to shop around at the time of insurance renewal.

The NAMA Board in 2012 determined that one of its main objectives would be the redemption of all senior bonds by 2020. <\/p><p>  I\u00a0am advised that the NAMA Chairman has recently stated that NAMA may now be in a position to complete its work sooner than the 2020 date initially envisaged. This is due to the strong performance of the Irish property market over the past year and NAMA's ability, as a result, to increase its Irish sales activity substantially. <\/p><p>  Its success in generating cash from asset sales has enabled NAMA to redeem &euro;13 billion of its senior debt to date and it expects to redeem another &euro;2 billion before the end of 2014.

On May 16, 2014, Moody's upgraded the Irish sovereign by two notches from Baa3 to Baa1, citing the accelerated reduction in the State's contingent liability due to the acceleration of NAMA's debt redemptions and the recent successes of the IBRC liquidation.\u00a0 On June 6, 2014, S&amp;amp;P upgraded the Irish sovereign to A-, specifically recognising the benefits to Ireland's credit worthiness from NAMA's accelerated bond repayments and going further in anticipating that NAMA would increase the pace of bond redemptions in 2014.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500057#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Government Debt","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500057#WRF03650"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[31063\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500057#WRF03700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected average annual interest rate to apply to general Government debt in 2014.","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":381,"content":"<p>The forecast average rate of interest on general government debt for 2014 is given as 3.9% in my Department's Stability Programme Update, 2014 published last April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500057#WRF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Bonds","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500057#WRF03850"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[31064\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500057#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the expected average annual interest rate to apply to the &euro;17 billion of extant senior bonds at the National Asset Management Agency in 2014.","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>I am advised by NAMA that 0.33% is the forecast expected average 6 month euribor interest rate on the NAMA senior bonds currently outstanding in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500057#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GDP-GNP Levels","counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500057#WRF04050"},{"type":"question","counter":386,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[31065\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500057#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"following the revision to the basis on which the national accounts are prepared, and the release of GDP and GNP figures by the Central Statistics Office for the first three months of 2014, if he will confirm the current best estimate budgetary adjustment required, in percentage and real terms, in 2015 to meet the agreed target as a result of GDP recalculation and revision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1107","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":387,"content":"<p>The most recent fiscal forecasts were contained in the Stability Programme Update published in April.\u00a0 The forecast for 2015 is predicated on a consolidation package of &euro;2.0bn which has been well flagged over recent years and represents no change in stated Government policy.\u00a0 This is estimated to deliver a general government deficit of 2.9% of GDP. <\/p><p>  However, as the Deputy notes, this forecast doesn't take into account the recently revised estimates of GDP by the Central Statistics Office.

A partial year yield is not available as it would depend on the date of introduction of the proposal. This estimate includes corporate gains. I am advised by the Commissioners that the estimate assumes no behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers.

Any such properties sold within seven years of being acquired will not qualify for the relief. Disposals made after the seven year period of ownership will be subject to CGT on any gain but effectively at a reduced rate by reference to the fraction that seven years bears to the overall period of ownership.

","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>The following arrangements currently apply to retirement lump sums paid under pension arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax.  They are also paid free of USC.  The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and &euro;575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%.  This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.  No USC is chargeable.  Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;575,000 is taxed at the individual's marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available).  In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess.  These amounts are lifetime amounts with prior lump sums aggregating with later lump sums.<\/p><p>  As there is no general requirement for data on retirement lump sums to be returned to my Department or to the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to provide definitive figures on the Exchequer impact of reducing the tax-free retirement lump sum amount from &euro;200,000 to &euro;80,000.  Furthermore, details of the marginal rate of income tax that each individual would pay on a taxable lump sum pension payment in the scenario outlined in the Deputy's question are not available.  Based on broad assumptions and an extrapolation of certain available data in relation to the public service, it is estimated that the additional tax yield from taxing lump sums of &euro;80,000 and over at the higher income tax rate of 41% could be about &euro;20 million in a full year.<\/p><p>  I have no data on which to provide a similar estimate in relation to the private sector.  I should point out, however, that one significant difference between public sector and private sector pension schemes is that private sector schemes invariably allow scheme members the option of commuting part of their pension fund for a tax-free lump sum.  The option of receiving benefits in the form of pension only is not available to members of public sector schemes.  Depending on the impact of any new tax charge on retirement lump sums, the option to commute part of a pension fund may no longer be exercised by private sector pension scheme members or may be exercised in a manner that reduces the value of the lump sum taken to minimise or avoid any immediate tax charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500059#WRH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":491,"content":"<p>Question No. 226 answered with Question No. 217.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":493,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[31247\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500059#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the partial and full-year revenue that would be raised for the Exchequer by increasing the stamp duty on share transactions from 1% to 1.5%.

However, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland,\u00a0have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals. <\/p><p>The provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting and the need to make adequate provisioning to meet these risks.\u00a0As a matter of course, insurance companies carry out reviews of the risks they are prepared to insure against and sometimes make decisions to discontinue certain types of cover which they consider high risk. Insurance Ireland has indicated that 98% of policyholders have household insurance which includes flood cover.<\/p><p>Government policy in relation to flooding is focussed on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.\u00a0\u00a0 The Office of Public Works (OPW)\u00a0is carrying out an assessment of flood risk throughout the country under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme.\u00a0 This programme will include the\u00a0 production of a comprehensive suite of flood risk maps and the development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk.\u00a0 The plans will consider the best possible options, both structural and non-structural, for dealing with the risks on a long-term basis. \u00a0 <\/p><p>This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016. Works are completed on a prioritised basis.\u00a0Because of the cost and scale of these types of flood defence works, this approach will see benefits over the medium and long term.<\/p><p>The OPW and Insurance Ireland have agreed on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes. The outcome of this arrangement is that the insurance industry will have a much greater level of information and understanding of the extent of the protection provided by completed OPW flood defence works and will therefore be able to reflect this in assessing the provision of flood insurance to householders in areas where works have been completed.<\/p><p>After the flooding events which took place in December 2013 and January 2014\u00a0the Government provided humanitarian assistance in areas affected by flooding under a new Department of Social Protection (DSP)\u00a0Humanitarian Assistance Scheme which was allocated of up to &euro;25 million. It provides means-tested financial support to people who have suffered damage to their homes as a result of\u00a0flooding.\u00a0 This\u00a0scheme will continue to be available.<\/p><p>In dealing with emergency events of this nature, the DSP generally adopts\u00a0an approach whereby it provides emergency income support payments in the immediate aftermath of the event to cover needs such as food, clothing, toiletries and accommodation, it\u00a0covers the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items after the flood water abates and the houses have dried out and\u00a0identifies what longer term financial support or works are required.\u00a0\u00a0Works carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting. Throughout this process, DSP staff engage with local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.<\/p><p>My Department is\u00a0undertaking a review of measures which could be taken to\u00a0increase the availability of flood insurance cover, including the past experience and future\u00a0proposals in other countries.\u00a0In assessing these, care has to be taken that the proposed solutions do not put in place arrangements which, over time, would weaken the provision of commercial insurance cover by the market with possible negative long-term consequences for the economy.<\/p><p>I am advised that in cases where individuals\u00a0are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance and believe that they are being treated unfairly it is open to them to contact the Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500060#WRJ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Rate","counter":592,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500060#WRJ03850"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[31521\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500060#WRJ03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider introducing a higher rate of property tax for residential units that are left vacant for more than six months as an incentive to ensure properties are either leased or sold; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>I have indicated previously that the central national rate of LPT would not vary for the lifetime of this Government.

While there are communicative aspects to the teaching and assessment of languages in post-primary schools, including oral\/aural examinations, there is also a significant written aspect, including essay writing, poetry and prose. For that, and other, reasons it is difficult to directly relate achievement in Leaving Certificate Irish with the CEFR.<\/p><p>  The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), now Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), produced a document in 2007 exploring the issues involved in establishing a relationship between the CEFR and the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ, in which the Leaving Certificate itself is placed across Levels 4 and 5. The document also set out some tentative equivalences between CEFR levels and NFQ levels.<\/p><p>  This informal process found that there could be considered to be a relatively strong correspondence between NFQ Level 3 (i.e. Junior Certificate level) and CEFR level A1, and between NFQ Level 5 and CEFR level B1. Therefore varying levels of achievement in Leaving Certificate Irish, across Levels 4 and 5 of the NFQ, might be considered to be broadly comparable to levels A2 and B1 of the CEFR.<\/p><p>  However, it must be stressed that the comparisons above are the result of an informal, exploratory process conducted by the NQAI to assess the feasibility of relating the NFQ to the CEFR. Establishing a direct relationship between the language competence demonstrated by achievement in the Leaving Certificate and the CEFR would require a more formal, detailed process to be undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500061#WRK04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[31005\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500061#WRK04600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will reverse the decision to remove the compulsory status of CSPE in the new junior cycle curriculum in view of the fact that Ireland has an obligation to provide human rights education as a result of various United Nations Conventions to which the Irish State is a party; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>In the context of the implementation of the new Framework for Junior Cycle the only subjects that will be \"compulsory\" are English, Mathematics and Irish. This decision has been taken to give schools the flexibility to develop their Junior Cycle programme mindful of the educational needs of their own students and mindful of the principles, statements of learning and key skills as set out in the Framework.<\/p><p>  Education about active citizenship and the promotion of human rights issues are an integral component of the new Framework for Junior Cycle. For example, one of the 24 'Statements of Learning', that encompass the key knowledge and skills that students will develop during their junior cycle, requires that all students will &quot;value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context&quot;.<\/p><p>  In addition, the 8 key skills which underpin the new Framework for Junior Cycle, include &quot;working with others&quot; whereby students should realise and experience how they can &quot;contribute to making the world a better place&quot;. As junior cycle students will experience the statements of learning and key skills, it is expected that education for active citizenship and education about human rights and responsibilities will continue to be an important part of the new Junior Cycle.<\/p><p>  A new short course in CSPE, which has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), will be available to schools to implement from this September, should they wish to do so as part of their Junior Cycle programme. Alternatively, schools may choose to continue to offer the current CSPE syllabus. The new short course is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.<\/p><p>  The new short course aims to inform, inspire, empower and enable young people to participate as active citizens in contemporary society at local, national and global levels based on an understanding of human rights and social responsibilities. One of the three strands in the short course focusses on 'rights and responsibilities'. The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR), the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), are key documents which underpin the course. Informed by these documents, CSPE students will be expected to participate in activities which include designing a campaign to highlight a human rights issue.<\/p><p>  As with Junior Cycle, education about active citizenship and human rights issues are also reflected at Senior Cycle. As part of transition year, students are afforded the opportunity to further interrogate some of the themes encountered in CSPE at Junior Cycle. This is facilitated by the availability of resources and materials that have been developed by a number of NGOs, including Amnesty International, for use by transition year pupils.<\/p><p>  I have also indicated my intention to introduce 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject. One of the objectives of the draft syllabus, which has been developed by the NCCA, is to develop 'a sense of care for others and a respect for and a valuing of diversity in all areas of human life within the parameters of human rights principles'.

In the circumstances I am advised that allowing for this option could likely accrue a substantial additional cost to the existing\u00a0accrued\u00a0liability of\u00a0public service pensions.\u00a0<\/p><p>As a\u00a0consequence I do not intend to bring forward proposals\u00a0to facilitate serving and former\u00a0civil servants (appointed prior to 1<sup>st<\/sup>September 1984) and\u00a0who exercised the option in 1984 not to join the Revised\u00a0Spouses' and Children's Superannuation Scheme to revisit that option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies Expenditure","counter":788,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01350"},{"type":"question","counter":789,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[31022\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the amount spent on legal fees by the Office of the Ombudsman for each of the past four years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":790,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's question, I am informed by the Office of the Ombudsman that the following are the amounts paid in Legal Costs by that Office for each of the years 2010 - 2013: <\/p><p><br \/><table><tr><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;343,000<\/td><td>&euro;455,000<\/td><td>&euro;156,000<\/td><td>&euro;543,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Relief Schemes Data","counter":791,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01550"},{"type":"question","counter":792,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[31088\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the planned flood relief scheme in Cork city; the timeline for the delivery of the project; the nature of the public consultation that will be held; if he will ensure that a fully manned consultation period over a number of days in the city is held; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This information day will be attended by members of the Design team to deal with queries from the public.  It is also intended to keep all information on display for up to a further five days to facilitate those who might wish to comment at this stage.  Committing the Design team to be available for all of this period would not be warranted.

There will be a number of days where members of the Design Team will be in attendance to deal directly with members of the public, all of which will be widely advertised.  At that stage, the outline design of the proposed scheme will be displayed with full drawings to ascertain the views of the public and other stakeholders.  Significant consultation is expected to take place with interested parties at this stage. <\/p><p>  Once the Exhibition is completed in early 2015, the Design Team will fully consider all submissions made and amendments, where appropriate, may be made and developed in the detailed design of the Scheme.  The OPW will then issue responses to all parties who made submissions.  It is expected that the detailed design phase will commence in the second quarter of 2015, with the procurement of civil works contractor to begin towards the end of 2015.  The timescale will, of course, be dependent on the acceptance of the proposed scheme by the public and the amount of amendments which may be proposed as a result of submissions made. Progression of the project to construction will be subject to the approval of my Department.  The OPW has made provision for the cost of the Scheme in its multi- annual budget profiles. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":794,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01750"},{"type":"question","counter":795,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[30825\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of positions filled in the role of administrative officer in each stream from the specialist panels recruited for in 2013 and to date in 2014; the geographic locations and Departments to which roles have been appointed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1041","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":796,"content":"<p>Five specialist streams\u00a0were included in the\u00a0Administrative Officer (AO)\u00a0competition in 2013 - Finance and Banking; Tax Policy; Law; Human Resources; and Economics.<\/p><p>In total, there have been 43\u00a0assignments and all were to posts in Dublin.<table><tr><th>Department\/Office<\/th><th>AO Finance and Banking<\/th><th>AO Tax Policy<\/th><th>AO Law<\/th><th>AO Human Resources<\/th><th>AO Economics<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Finance<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PER<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Revenue<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ombudsman<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Health<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public Appointments Service<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Children and Youth Affairs<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Communications, Marine and Natural Resources<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Oireachtas<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":797,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM01950"},{"type":"question","counter":798,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[30982\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500063#WRM02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps being taken to address flood risks within the Shannon basin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":799,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Commissioners of Public Works that the core strategy for addressing flood risk in the Shannon Basin is the River Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study.

During the year a total of 13,367 new jobs were created in IDA Ireland client companies and 164 investments were won which exceeded the targets set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.  Of the 164 investments won, 78 came from companies investing in Ireland for the first time, with 59 expansions and 27 Research, Development and Innovation projects.

The projects approved during the first half of 2014 will lead to the creation of 8,000 jobs this year and over future years as the companies roll out their investment plans.<\/p><p>Continuing the strong flow of jobs growth from multinational companies is a crucial part of our Action Plan for Jobs.  We have put in place a range of measures to support jobs growth in this area, including extra IDA staff overseas, an increase in the number of Ministerial trade missions and new advance facilities in regional cities and towns.  In the past three years we have seen a total of more than 18,000 net new jobs created in multinational companies across the country.

These are focused on assisting Irish firms target and secure international contracts and overseas partners.  In Ireland, Enterprise Ireland works directly with Irish firms to help them start up, develop their businesses, build competitiveness, and innovate so they can become successful exporters.

The number of ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions has more than doubled since 2011.  The impact of trade missions together with the many other sales, marketing and trade promotion efforts of Enterprise Ireland are reflected in the growth in exports of Enterprise Ireland clients and the jobs they sustain and create. As announced recently, Irish companies supported by Enterprise Ireland set a new export record of &euro;17.1bn in 2013.  This represents an increase of 8% on 2012.

These pilot programmes will now be rolled out into other companies across the Division, allowing us to show companies the talent we have on the live register which in turn should lead to increased opportunities for participants. <\/p><p>  Three major recruitment fairs were held in Dundalk and Drogheda with a further fair planned to take place in Monaghan in September this year. In addition DSP has hosted on-going employer briefing and breakfast sessions with local employers. The new employer unit is working very closely with local employers and offering a very hands-on proactive service, ensuring we are matching suitable people to vacancies. This approach is beginning to pay dividends with the employer unit fast becoming the first choice recruiter for many employers both large and small in the area. <\/p><p>  Department officials in the North East are also beginning work on many new initiatives for their area including establishing a tourism group to identify job opportunities, skills shortages and future need in this and are working closely with the local Chamber of Commerce, Louth economic Forum and Dundalk Business Investment District Scheme to help create opportunities for jobseekers in the area.<\/p><p>  At present there are more than 7,000 people employed in companies based in Co. Louth and supported by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and LEO Louth - the Local Enterprise Office.  In 2013 alone, almost 1,000 jobs were created in Co. Louth in companies supported by these three bodies, in comparison to just over 800 created in 2012.  This pattern suggests that the jobs that are being created are adding value to the local economy and have every potential to be sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500064#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":874,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500064#WRN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":875,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[30664\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500064#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the correct level of rent allowance in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; if and when it will be reinstated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":876,"content":"<p>The client is in receipt of their maximum entitlement to rent supplement based on location, family configuration and means  .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500064#WRN02800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":877,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500064#WRN02900"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[30713\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500064#WRN03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on correspondence (details supplied) regarding social protection payments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>I understand the Deputy is referring to entitlement to a jobseeker&rsquo;s scheme by persons who have completed a Youthreach programme.

Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act must comply with the provisions in the Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Authority.  This guidance makes provision for the notification of all scheme members in advance of any application to the Pensions Authority to issue a notice to the trustees of a pension scheme to restructure scheme benefits.  In such circumstances, scheme members will have at least one month to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such a proposal.  The Pensions Authority must be satisfied that all the provisions in the guidance are complied with before the Authority will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits.  <\/p><p>  The provisions in section 50 of the Pensions Act were amended in 2009 and again in 2013. Prior to the amendments made in 2009, the benefits of active scheme members could only be considered in the context of a restructuring of scheme benefits under section 50 of the Act. This provision was broadened in 2009 to include the benefits of deferred scheme members and future increases in scheme benefits for all scheme members. The Social Welfare and Pensions (No.2) Act 2013 made further changes to section 50 of the Pensions Act and extended the provisions to include a portion of pensioner benefits in any consideration of the restructure of scheme benefits.   These changes essentially provide for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members.  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interest of all scheme members.

The incentive is payable, on a monthly basis, over a two year period if the employee is retained in full-time employment for two years.  JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed.  The value of the aggregate monthly payments is &euro;7,500 for employing a jobseeker 12 to 24 months on the Live Register and &euro;10,000 if the jobseeker was on the Live Register for over 24 months.  <\/p><p>Since its launch in July 2013 to the end of June 2014, JobsPlus has supported 2,634 jobseekers in full-time employment with 2,007 employers nationally. Around 60% of jobseekers being supported had been on the Live Register for over 24 months at the time of recruitment.  Up to the end of June 2014, payments under the JobsPlus scheme have amounted to just over &euro;4.4 million.  Overall, payments under the scheme have amounted to &euro;5.5 million since the first payments were made in August 2013.  The table below gives a breakdown of expenditure on a monthly basis since the scheme commenced. <\/p><p>A provision of &euro;13.5 million has been included in the Vote for the Department for the scheme in 2014.  On the basis of the current pace of applications and expenditure, this provision is considered to be adequate to meet projected costs of the scheme in 2014.  <\/p><p>In line with Pathways to Work, jobseekers on the Live Register are a particular focus for intervention and the JobsPlus Incentive is, therefore, exclusively targeted at this cohort. As a result, a person in receipt of a one parent family payment is not considered eligible. The Department is completing a review of the initial phase of implementation of JobsPlus and this will inform any proposals for its development and expansion.  The review will consider a range of matters, including uptake, costs and benefits, altering eligibility requirements, and if changes are need to improve access and administration. Any changes will, of course, be subject to budgetary considerations. <\/p><p>Table: JobsPlus - Number of Employee Supported<table><tr><th><b>Month<\/b><\/th><th><b>Employees supported<\/b><\/th><th><b>Businesses supported<\/b><\/th><th><b>Grants paid - <\/b><br \/><br \/><b>&euro;<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>August 2013<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>78<\/td><td>31,771<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September 2013<\/td><td>235<\/td><td>208<\/td><td>88,031<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October 2013<\/td><td>517<\/td><td>456<\/td><td>194,063<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>November 2013<\/td><td>844<\/td><td>707<\/td><td>316,772<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December 2013<\/td><td>1,114<\/td><td>888<\/td><td>418,856<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>January 2014<\/td><td>1,286<\/td><td>1,117<\/td><td>483,440<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February 2014<\/td><td>1,589<\/td><td>1,230<\/td><td>596,357<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March 2014<\/td><td>1,874<\/td><td>1,434<\/td><td>704,066<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>April 2014<\/td><td>2,115<\/td><td>1,611<\/td><td>794,691<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>May 2014<\/td><td>2,385<\/td><td>1,811<\/td><td>896,254<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>June 2014<\/td><td>2,634<\/td><td>2,007<\/td><td>989,901<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Expenditure for 2014 only<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>4,464,709<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cumulative expenditure to date<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>5,514,202<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500064#WRN06900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Education Allowance Eligibility","counter":918,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500064#WRN07000"},{"type":"question","counter":919,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[31050\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500064#WRN07100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the qualifying criteria for back to education allowance; if a person who has previously received the allowance may reapply if undertaking studies at the same level as when previously receiving the allowance; if certified illness will be considered in the circumstance whereby illness prevented an applicant from completing their initial course while on the allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":920,"content":"<p>Back to education allowance (BTEA) is an education scheme for people in receipt of certain social welfare payments who wish to pursue a full-time second level or third level course of education.<\/p><p>  A person wishing to pursue BTEA will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, commencing a full-time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college.

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A. (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.5%). <\/p><p>  Self-employed workers may, similar to PAYE workers, access social welfare supports by establishing eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment. <\/p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral. <\/p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. <\/p><p>  The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. <\/p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person. <\/p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO02400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Eligibility","counter":955,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO02450"},{"type":"question","counter":956,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[31435\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her views on the recent proposals made by the Carers Association in relation to the contributory State pension entitlement for lifetime family carers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":957,"content":"<p>The State pension is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system. <\/p><p>  Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. This is particularly important given the challenges in relation to the future sustainability of the State pension, with increased numbers of older people living longer.<\/p><p>  When assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension, and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account.<\/p><p>  The State already assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory). The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.   The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. <\/p><p>  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions.  They also need to satisfy a yearly average condition.   A yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate pension, and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages.  <\/p><p>  However, for those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the overall State pension system provides alternative methods of support.   In this instance, these individuals may have access to alternative income supports, depending on their circumstances.  They may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219.   If their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30.   This increase is paid directly to the qualified adult. <\/p><p>  A total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) in 2020, although that date is subject to change. Issues such as equality of outcomes for women and men, including those who spend some years outside the labour market on caring duties, will be considered carefully in the context of that reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO02600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":958,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO02650"},{"type":"question","counter":959,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[31437\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO02700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if the improvements made in relation to domiciliary care allowance can be extended to carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant, as recommended by the Carers Association; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1078","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":960,"content":"<p>In its 2015 pre-budget submission to the Department, the Carers Association welcomed the recent review of domiciliary care allowance (DCA), acknowledged the very significant improvements that the revised application process for DCA will offer parents caring for children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) and requested that the application process for carers payments be similarly revised.   <\/p><p>  The Department will discuss this issue with the Carers Association in the context of its ongoing consultation with the association and other carers&rsquo; representative groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO02800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Register Data","counter":961,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO02850"},{"type":"question","counter":962,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[31470\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will provide a breakdown by month since March 2011 of the number of persons who are on the live register in County Louth; including the number of persons who are short term and long term unemployed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":967,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 399 and 408 together.<\/p><p>  The one-parent family payment (OFP) has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents since its introduction in 1997.  The number of OFP recipients stood at 74,426 in June, 2014, and an estimated &euro;863 million will be spent on the scheme during 2014.<\/p><p>  The OFP scheme is in the process of being reformed. These reforms are reducing on a phased basis, the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases to 7 years from 2014 for new entrants and from 2015 for existing recipients. <\/p><p>  On 3 July the latest phase of the OFP reforms was implemented when 5,140 lone parents entitlement to OFP ceased. It is expected that approximately 3,600 of these customers will seek to transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) payment.  The exact number of affected customers who will be moving to the JA scheme will depend on the number of these customers who may instead be eligible to apply for the family income supplement (FIS) payment.<\/p><p>  Some 70% of affected customers who make the transition from the OFP payment to the JA payment are not working and, as such, will not suffer any reduction in their new income support payment as the JA payment pays the same personal and qualified child rates as the OFP payment.  One of the aims of the OFP reforms is to provide lone parents with access to the Department&rsquo;s activation supports with the purpose of assisting the large cohort of former OFP recipients who are currently not working, improve their prospects of securing employment. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, any of these customers with a child aged under 14 years will be entitled to the JA transitional arrangement, which exempts them from having to be genuinely seeking, and available for, full-time employment.  This special arrangement enables lone parents with young children who are working part-time &ndash; e.g. during mornings only &ndash; to remain in work and to receive income and activation supports as appropriate.  The arrangement thus allows them to balance their caring responsibilities and, at the same time, significantly reduces their requirement for child care.<\/p><p>  Lone parents who are working and who transfer to the JA scheme may suffer a reduction in their income support payment due to the fact that the JA means test is less generous than the OFP means test.  The exact amount of this reduction will depend on a person&rsquo;s respective earnings.<\/p><p>  However, if a lone parent is working a minimum of 19 hours per week, or is in a position to increase their working hours up to that level, they will be advised by the Department to apply for the FIS payment as this is the most beneficial income support for them.  New FIS applications from these lone parents are, as a result, being expedited.  <\/p><p>  Lone parents who transition to either JA or FIS and who are in employment, may be able to avail of the after school child care (ASCC) scheme. This scheme provides subsidised childcare for children of primary school age. Under this scheme parents make a parental contribution of &euro;15 per child per week and receive after school child care for 5 days a week. This is a significant support and it builds on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs other childcare schemes, which currently support approximately 35,000 children from low income families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO03300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":968,"content":"<p>Question No. 400 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Eligibility","counter":969,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO03450"},{"type":"question","counter":970,"qnumday":401,"qnumall":"[31519\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 226 of 9 July 2014, her views on whether it is reasonable that a MS sufferer (details supplied) was refused disability allowance because their means were two cent over the statutory limit.","asker":"1192","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":971,"content":"<p>Disability allowance is a means tested scheme and the way means are assessed is laid down in social welfare legislation.

CE participants will now also receive full support for children in primary school. <\/p><p>  As a result of this change, CE participants will no longer require access to the after-school childcare (ASCC) programme as their childcare needs will now be met under the CEC programme.  CE participants already on the ASCC programme will not be affected.<\/p><p>  The budget for this childcare programme is &euro;7.5m for 2014. There will be 1,200 part-time places available for CE participants with children up to 5 years of age (as CE is a part-time programme), and 800 places available for CE participants with children who require after-school childcare. Places are filled on a first come, first served basis.  The changes are due to be implemented from Monday, 14 July 2014. <\/p><p>  Childcare is a crucial element for parents embarking on CE or returning to the workforce. These changes are aimed at ensuring that CE participants get the childcare supports they need to have a better future for themselves and their families. This Department continues to work closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500065#WRO04200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":981,"content":"<p>Question No. 405 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":983,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":984,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[31589\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the progress made in implementing the youth guarantee scheme; if data is available on the progress of the pilot programme under the scheme; when the scheme will be more widely introduced; and the lead agencies in its implementation.","asker":"1110","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":985,"qnumday":416,"qnumall":"[31636\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which the issue of youth unemployment continues to be tackled by her Department; if she has discussions with other relevant Departments in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":986,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 406 and 416 together.  <\/p><p>The Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan was published in January.  It provides for the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed. It also provides for over 28,000 programme opportunities for unemployed young people in 2014, as set out in the appendix table, as follows. This figure excludes some 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.  These PLC and apprenticeship places, together with the wide range of vocational third-level courses provided for the young, although not reserved for unemployed jobseekers, nevertheless contribute to the spirit of the guarantee. <\/p><p>In relation to the 28,500 places for unemployed young people, approximately 6,800 of these were taken up in the first half of 2014 (see table below for a detailed breakdown). This is broadly in line with expectations, as some programmes such as the student intake on programmes such as the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and Vocational Training Opportunity Scheme (VTOS) are concentrated in September\/October in line with the academic calendar.  A new intake of young people to the second iteration of the Momentum programme for long-term unemployed jobseekers is also scheduled for later in the year.

This legislation is being enacted as part of the Spring Social Welfare Bill which has now passed all stages in the Oireachtas.  Two employment schemes in particular, the Youth Guarantee developmental internship programme and the JobsPlus variant for young people, are dependent on this legislation being passed. The JobsPlus variant will be available as soon as possible after the relevant legislation has been cleared. The developmental internship, which will include a pre-internship training period, will be in place no later than autumn. Passage of the legislation will also permit the proposed introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed.<\/p><p>With specific reference to the Ballymun pilot, the latest data (June 24<sup>th<\/sup>)  shows that a total of 689 young people have attended Group Engagement sessions since the launch of the pilot. Of these a further 403 have been profiled. In total, there have been 1,388 guidance meetings conducted, with clients often attending multiple guidance meetings as part of an intensive guidance process prior to an appropriate offer being made. To date a total of 334 offers have been made, including 115 offers of employment and 187 offers of training or further education.<\/p><p>While the Youth Guarantee is being piloted in Ballymun it is also being rolled out nationally. Full implementation of the national Youth Guarantee will, as previously mentioned, only take place in the autumn.  Implementation in specific areas of the country will be determined primarily by the level and trend of youth unemployment and the resulting demand for places, and the programme mix of such places, in each area. Local implementation of the Youth Guarantee will be a matter for the respective Department of Social Protection Divisions in each respective divisional area.<\/p><p>Prior to the design of the Youth Guarantee for Ireland, the Department of Social Protection set up an interdepartmental Youth Guarantee Implementation Group with officials and programme managers from the Department of Education and Skills, Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The terms of reference for this group were to review the current range of youth employment policies in Ireland to assess what measures were needed for the implementation of the Guarantee.<\/p><p>While the Department of Social Protection (DSP) has been identified as the lead co-ordinating organisation for the youth guarantee it will partner with other Departments and agencies in the roll out of the Guarantee. The main partner bodies, working alongside DSP, in the central administration will be:<\/p><p>- the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills (DES), and its relevant agencies including SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority;<\/p><p>- the Department of Jobs, Enterprise &amp;amp; Innovation (DJEI), which will provide jobs for young people, including through the promotion of entrepreneurship;<\/p><p>- the Department of Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs (DCYA), responsible for state policy and provision on youth work services, and for securing good educational and welfare outcomes for young people through the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB);<\/p><p>- the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform (DPER), responsible for overseeing exchequer funding and ensuring that Youth Guarantee-related programmes will be thoroughly evaluated and will provide value for money. <\/p><p>The Department of Social Protection remains in constant contact with these government departments and agencies with regard to the implementation of the Youth Guarantee scheme and collates statistics monitoring the progress of the Youth Guarantee scheme.<\/p><p>Annexe Table<\/p><p>Expected participation, activation programmes, 2014<table><tr><th>Programme<\/th><th>Average participation<\/th><th>Inflow of new participants<\/th><th>Expected inflow<br \/><br \/>of young people<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Youthreach\/CTC<\/td><td>6,000<\/td><td>3,300<\/td><td>3,300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including planned reserve)<\/td><td>7,700<\/td><td>13,300<\/td><td>5,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tus<\/td><td>7,500<\/td><td>7,500<\/td><td>1,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobsPlus<\/td><td>4,000<\/td><td>2,000<\/td><td>1,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Momentum<\/td><td>6,500<\/td><td>6,500<\/td><td>2,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)<\/td><td>18,500<\/td><td>9,300<\/td><td>3,300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BTWEA<\/td><td>11,000<\/td><td>5,500<\/td><td>200<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>VTOS<\/td><td>5,600<\/td><td>2,800<\/td><td>500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FAS\/Solas<\/td><td>10,300<\/td><td>25,000<\/td><td>9,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>700<\/td><td>700<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CEB\/MFI micro-loans for young people<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>150<\/td><td>150<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training<\/td><td>250<\/td><td>250<\/td><td>250<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gateway<\/td><td>3,000<\/td><td>3,000<\/td><td>450<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Employment<\/td><td>25,300<\/td><td>12,700<\/td><td>500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>105,650<\/td><td>92,000<\/td><td>28,350<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PLCs<\/td><td>35,000<\/td><td>32,000<\/td><td>22,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/><br \/>Apprenticeship<\/td><td>8,000<\/td><td>2,500<\/td><td>2,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><br \/><br \/>Vocational Third Level<\/td><td>It is estimated that at least 50% of the 41,000 entrants to third level each year are entering courses leading towards defined occupations <\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":987,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP00450"},{"type":"question","counter":988,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[31600\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when an application for carer's allowance will be approved in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford.","asker":"1096","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":989,"content":"<p>The Department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person in question and that a decision has issued to the person concerned on 14 July 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP00600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":990,"content":"<p>Question No. 408 answered with Question No. 399.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Data","counter":991,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP00750"},{"type":"question","counter":992,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[31628\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which the number in receipt of jobseeker's allowance has fluctuated in each of the past five years to date;

This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy.<\/p><p>The most recent figures for participation on the main activation programmes are set out in the following table:<\/p><p><b>Activation Programmes (May 2013 and May 2014)<\/b><table><tr><th><b>-<\/b><\/th><th><b>MAY - 13<\/b><\/th><th><b>MAY - 14<\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Work allowance scheme &ndash; Employee strand.<sup>[1]<\/sup><\/td><td>16<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Work Enterprise allowance scheme &ndash; self-employed strand.<\/td><td>10,406<\/td><td>10,419<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Short-term Enterprise Allowance<sup>[2]<\/sup><\/td><td>1,041<\/td><td>546<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total - Back to Work schemes<\/b><\/td><td><b>11,463<\/b><\/td><td><b>10,971<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Part-time Job Incentive <\/td><td>258<\/td><td>343<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>T&Uacute;S - Community Work Placement Initiative<\/td><td>5,059<\/td><td>7,379<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>JobBridge -National Internship Scheme<\/td><td>6,137<\/td><td>6,977<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total - Other Activation Programmes<\/b><\/td><td><b>11,454<\/b><\/td><td><b>14,699<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS)<\/td><td>5,000<\/td><td>5,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Back to Education Allowance<sup>[3]<\/sup><\/td><td>17,830<\/td><td>13,300<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total - Back to Education Courses:<\/b><\/td><td><b>22,830<\/b><\/td><td><b>18,300<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Community Employment Schemes (excluding Supervisors)<\/td><td>21,252<\/td><td>23,142<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>FAS full time training for the unemployed &ndash; Provisional for May 14<\/td><td>9,395<\/td><td>7,475<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL<\/b><\/td><td><b>76,394<\/b><\/td><td><b>74,587<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table>[1]<b><\/b>This scheme was closed to new applications from 1st May 2009.<\/p><p>[2]<b><\/b>This scheme was introduced from 1st May 2009.

Includes MOMENTUM participants from February 2013.<\/p><p>Within this wide range of programmes and services to help jobseekers back to employment,  the Department of Social Protection operates four main schemes whose purpose is to provide a pathway to employment:<\/p><p>- JobsPlus is targeted specifically at encouraging employers to recruit people who are long-term unemployed.  Over 2,600 long-term unemployed people have been placed in employment as a result of JobsPlus and over 60% of these have been unemployed for 2 years or more;<\/p><p>- Community Employment and T&uacute;s provide work experience opportunities for long term unemployed jobseekers mainly within the community and voluntary sector.  The numbers of participants on Community Employment and T&uacute;s as of May 2014 were 23,142 and 7,379 respectively up from 21,252 and 5,059 in May 2013;<\/p><p>- The JobBridge scheme provides a stepping stone for unemployed people to employment in the wider economy.  As of the end of May there were just under 7,000 participants on the Scheme, up 14% from 6,137  in May 2013.  To date nearly 30,000 people have participated in the scheme.  Evaluation results indicate that 61% of leavers from JobBridge find employment within 5 months of leaving their internship;<\/p><p>With specific reference to the long-term unemployed, targets were set for participation by this group in DSP activation schemes and Department of Education and Skills Further Education and Training for 2013. Taken together approximately 80,462 places out of 263,788 were reserved for the long term unemployed in 2013. Progress in meeting this target is shown in the following table:<\/p><p>2013 Outturn<table><tr><th><b>-<\/b><\/th><th><b>Total Number of Starters<\/b><\/th><th><b>LTU Starters<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>(Year End Estimates) <\/b><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total DSP<\/b><\/td><td><b>43,442<\/b><\/td><td><b>23,291<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total DES Part Time provision<\/td><td>149,207<\/td><td>36,373<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total DES Full Time provision<\/td><td>67,576<\/td><td>23,282<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Total DES<\/b><\/td><td><b>216,753<\/b><\/td><td><b>59,655<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Overall Total<\/b><\/td><td><b>260,195<\/b><\/td><td><b>82,946<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table>Overall for both Departments, it is estimated that 82,946 places were filled by the long term unemployed. This represents 103% of the 2013 LTU target and a 78% increase in LTU participation in 2013 compared to 2012.<\/p><p>In terms of impact, there are definite signs of improvement in the labour market since the launch of Pathways to Work in 2012. Official figures from the CSO show that long-term unemployment has been falling over this period. Since the lowest point of the jobs crisis, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of over 15% to 11.6% at present while the long-term unemployment rate has fallen from 9.5% to 7.3%.  The number of long-term unemployed has fallen from 204,000 in early 2012 to 156,000 at present.  In terms of the Live Register, a target was set in Pathways to Work that 75,000 of those who were long-term on the Register at the beginning of 2012 would move into employment by the end of 2015; the number who have already done so is now almost 50,000.<\/p><p>The impact of Pathways to Work cannot be precisely separated from the impact of other factors affecting the decline in long-term unemployment (such as the general improvement in the economy and the labour market resulting from the government&rsquo;s overall economic and employment policies).  A full evaluation of the Pathways to Work programme will be commissioned next year which will seek to quantify what aspects of Pathways to Work are most effective and the reasons for their effectiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1008,"content":"<p>Question No. 416 answered with Question No. 406.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Applications","counter":1009,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1010,"qnumday":417,"qnumall":"[31637\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the degree to which applications for various forms of assistance or allowance including jobseeker's allowance from the self-employed continue to be processed by her Department; the number of such applications that have been successful in each of the past five years to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Following an assessment of the proposal, I granted approval for the sale on 29 July 2013, subject to a number of specific conditions being fulfilled. I am advised that the sale of Arramara Teo was concluded on 7 May 2014 and that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is satisfied that the conditions laid down have been fully complied with.<\/p><p>With regard to the sale process itself, I understand that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta considered that the most appropriate mechanism was to engage consultants to identify potential strategic partners in the seaweed industry for the purpose of securing the future development of Arramara Teo. I am advised by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that that process was carried out in accordance with the   <i>Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies (2009).<\/i><\/p><p>I understand that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta engaged consultants RSM FGS in July 2010 to assist in identifying a potential strategic partner for Arramara Teo. I understand that RSM FGS compiled a list of nine potential partners, who were invited to submit expressions of interest. Six expressions of interest were received, which were assessed and shortlisted to three preferred potential partners, ranked first, second, and third. I understand that the first-ranked preferred potential partner was granted a period of exclusivity in order to enable it to undertake a process of due diligence and that it subsequently indicated that it was no longer interested in Arramara Teo. As the next ranked preferred potential partner, I understand that negotiations were opened with Acadian Seaplants Ltd, which culminated in the sale to it of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta's shares in Arramara Teo. The identification process and the negotiations with the potential partners identified took place during the period from July 2010 to February 2013.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the best value that could be obtained for Arramara Teo was achieved through this course of action. As a multinational company based in Nova Scotia, Canada with significant experience in the seaweed processing sector, I am satisfied that Acadian Seaplants Ltd has the expertise to develop Arramara Teo and secure its long-term future for the benefit of its stakeholders. I believe that this strategic partnership will secure Arramara's future in Connemara and will result in the development of the seaweed processing sector here.<\/p><p>In that context, I particularly welcome the announcement made by Acadian Seaplants Ltd on 4 July that it is to make an initial investment of &euro;2 million in Arramara Teo as a first step and that further investment will follow in areas of research, development of value-added products, market development, processing technologies and capital expenditure. I am confident that these investments will ensure a continuous demand for seaweed from the local harvesters and will provide additional employment in the area.<\/p><p>While I am unable to give any further details with regard to the terms of the sale of Arramara Teo because of the confidentiality provisions of the contract, I am advised by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that continuity of supply to Arramara's existing Irish customers is assured. One of the conditions of the sale agreement between &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Acadian Seaplants Ltd related to existing Irish customers of Arramara Teo being guaranteed supply of product on reasonable terms and conditions into the future. In that regard, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has confirmed that the sale agreement provides for the protection of future supply to existing Irish customers of Arramara Teo, with no increase in price for Year 1 and with prices advantageous to the Irish customers as against international customers being secured. It is also understood that Acadian Seaplants Ltd has covenanted to continue to supply the Irish customers. In the event of a breach of covenant, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has advised that penalties would apply.<\/p><p>With regard to the hearings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the licensing and harvesting of seaweed on 8 July, I understand that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta advocated that the harvesting of wild seaweed should be regulated in the interest of attracting investment to develop the sector. I understand that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has been advocating regulation in the sector since 2006, when it first made submissions to the relevant Departments on the issue of licensing. I also understand that this position was underlined in work carried out in 2007 on <i>A Resource Development Strategy for the Gaeltacht Coastal Zone<\/i>by Dr. Valerie Cummins, Director of the Coastal and Marine Research Centre (CMRC), University College Cork. Accordingly, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that this issue is independent of the sale of Arramara Teo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP03300","answer":true,"speaker":"973"},{"type":"question","counter":1029,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[30719\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500066#WRP03400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if he will provide detail all grants and public funds allocated to an organisation (details supplied) in County Limerick over the past 20 years; the corporate structure of this organisation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"973"},{"type":"speech","counter":1030,"content":"<p>The annual administration grants provided to the organisation referred to by the Deputy from 2004 to date are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Grant<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2004<\/td><td>&euro;50,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2005<\/td><td>&euro;70,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>&euro;80,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>&euro;90,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>&euro;150,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>&euro;140,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>&euro;110,500<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>&euro;100,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>&euro;110,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>&euro;110,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014\u00a0 <\/td><td>&euro;110,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table>In addition to the above allocations, the organisation in question also received a number of project-specific grants from my Department.

There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.<\/p><p>  In terms of the direct financial contribution to the State, profits from the three Kinsale area gas fields are taxed at a rate of 25%. In addition royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head. The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields.<\/p><p>  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field or from future production from the Corrib gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987. Profits from the Corrib gas field will be taxed at 25% when the field goes into production. The Corrib partners have indicated that the expected timeline for first gas is mid-2015.<\/p><p>  The rate of tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence or licensing option granted from January 2007 to May 2014 will be between 25% and 40% depending on the profitability of the field.<\/p><p>  Under the Wood Mackenzie recommendations the rate of tax that will apply to profits arising from any future commercial discoveries made under an exploration licence or licensing option granted from June 2014 onwards will be between 25% and 55% depending on the profitability of the field.<\/p><p>  The level of profits arising from a field depend on a combination of factors including, the volume of recoverable gas or oil, the cost of developing and operating the infrastructure, the price of gas or oil over the life of the field, together with the timing and profile of production.<\/p><p>  The operation of the taxation system and the receipt of taxation are matters for the Revenue Commissioners. As a consequence I am not in a position to provide the Deputy with the current position as regards tax paid or due to the Exchequer in respect of the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads (Kinsale area) fields, nor to provide estimates of how such a position might alter under hypothetical increased tax rates.

This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and a State-led intervention for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. Commercial operators combined have either invested, or committed to invest, approximately &euro;2.5 billion in their Irish networks, delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses. <\/p><p>As a result of this accelerated investment the addressable area required by the State-led intervention has been reduced by 30% since the National Broadband Plan was launched. While the commercial developments are welcome the acceleration of investment is largely contained to cities and towns. Consequently, the speeds that are available in these areas are demonstrably better than those that are available in more rural areas. <\/p><p>On 25 April last, the Government's commitment to a major telecommunications network build-out to rural Ireland, with fibre as the foundation of its investment, as part of the State-led intervention under the National Broadband Plan was announced. This commitment is a clear expression of Government&rsquo;s determination to address the connectivity challenge in rural Ireland in a meaningful and sustainable way. <\/p><p>Central to the strategy will be a long term, future proofed infrastructure build with next generation backhaul infrastructure (likely to be primarily fibre based) as the key component underpinning whatever access technology delivers the service (fixed or wireless). This infrastructure build will extend to locations in every county in the State identified as having no existing or planned enabling fibre network. It will be part of an end-to-end strategy that will address all parts of Ireland that cannot access commercial high speed broadband services.<\/p><p>A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department which will identify those areas that will require a State intervention. A county-by-county list of towns and villages which have already been identified for a fibre build-out has been published and is available on my Department's website, . Currently, a total of 33 areas in County Leitrim, including Drumleerin, have been identified as requiring an intervention. This is an indicative list and is subject to the completion of the mapping exercise. Further locations may be identified as this process continues. Similarly, it may be determined that some locations on the list will be addressed by the commercial sector and will therefore not require State intervention. <\/p><p>I would point out that the EU Commission&rsquo;s guidelines on State aid for high speed broadband infrastructure preclude Member States from intervening in regions in which private investors have demonstrated plans to roll out their own infrastructure within the following three years. In this regard, I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 15 fibre based broadband networks in County Leitrim by July 2016. Furthermore, the recent announcement regarding a joint venture between ESB and Vodafone includes a proposal to provide high speed broadband to Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim.<\/p><p>A stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the State-led intervention has recently been launched. This consultation, among other things, seeks views on the proposed criteria to be used in finalising those locations which require a State intervention. The outcome of this consultation will enable finalisation of the mapping exercise, which I expect will be concluded in the autumn. <\/p><p>In tandem with the completion of the mapping exercise, intensive design and planning work is ongoing in my Department with a view to producing a detailed end to end strategy for the State-led intervention. It is my intention to conduct a full public consultation on the outcome of the mapping process and the proposed strategy. EU State aid clearance will also be required for the intervention once finalised.

In the case of water services, under the provisions of the Water Services Act 2007, households&rsquo; pipes internal to the boundary of a property are considered the responsibility of the householder, and thus water meters are being fitted at the stopcock at the boundary of the property.  Meters will be read automatically and the information will be provided directly to customers in their bills.<\/p><p>Of the estimated 1.35 million domestic properties connected to public water supplies, approximately 300,000 properties will not be metered as part of the current phase, due to the cost or technical difficulty of doing so.  These properties would include apartment blocks, other multi-occupancy buildings and houses with shared service connections.  Irish Water commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections.  This report has been submitted to my Department and its   recommendations are being considered. In particular, my Department is exploring with Irish Water the potential to include a new phase of metering of some 48,000 apartments, which the report suggests can be easily metered as part of a separate procurement. <\/p><p>Households that are connected to the public water supply, but do not have a water meter installed, will be charged on an assessed basis, primarily based on occupancy.  There will also be provision for a rebate, when a customer moves from an assessed charge to a metered charge and usage is deemed above a reasonable threshold by comparison to the subsequent metered usage.<\/p><p>The proposed approach to charging has been outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it has submitted to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in line with the provisions of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 . The CER is responsible for approving the plan. I understand that the CER will initiate a public consultation shortly in relation to the water charges plan.

There is a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat.  My Department continues to be responsible for a range of programmes and initiatives to support communities and disadvantaged groups, including the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) which is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State.  The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281m over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 pending the rollout of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) from January 2015.   <\/p><p>  The objective of the LCDP is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities.  It is a key tool of Government in providing supports for the 'harder to reach' in the most disadvantaged areas and communities.\u00a0 &euro;47.707 million has been allocated to the LCDP for 2014, a reduction of &euro;1 million or 2% on the 2013 allocation, the smallest reduction to the Programme since 2010.  Pavee Point, the National Traveller Partnership and the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum are currently all in receipt of funding under the LCDP.   <\/p><p>  My Department also supports a number of Traveller projects under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO).

A number of Traveller community groups were successful in applying for funding under the scheme, including Pavee Point, the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum and the Irish Traveller Movement.   <\/p><p>  In the case of housing capital funding for Traveller-specific accommodation, the allocation for 2014 is &euro;3 million.  While this represents a decrease of &euro;1 million compared to 2013, I do not expect that this will have a major impact on activity in 2014 as the Traveller Accommodation Programmes 2009 to 2013 came to an end in December 2013.  This capital funding stream is used to provide 100% funding to housing authorities for the provision and maintenance of Traveller-specific accommodation and, in doing so, is designed to meet the specific and distinct accommodation needs of the Traveller community, such as halting sites and group housing schemes.  In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, new multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes, which will run for the 5-year period to the end of 2018, will be introduced in 2014.  As a result, 2014 is a transition year with a strong emphasis on the planning of programmes for the period up to the end of 2018.  Based on the current status of approved Traveller-specific projects and considering that the new programmes were put in place in April, this is considered sufficient to meet current requirements.  If it transpires that the 2014 provision is insufficient, I will review the position with a view to augmenting the capital provision, if possible.   <\/p><p>  It should be recognised that the vast majority of Traveller families have opted for, and are accommodated in, standard housing provided by local authorities and financed from my Department&rsquo;s capital allocations for social housing, or in private rented accommodation with Rent Supplement support.  It is open to Travellers to opt for any form of accommodation and local authority Traveller Accommodation Programmes are intended to reflect these preferences.     <\/p><p>  My Department also provides funding for accommodation-related supports and social inclusion measures for Travellers which operate in tandem with the capital programme.

The less calcium ions the greater the absorption and more effective the result.  Milk products are rich in calcium.

Section 86 explicitly provides that the Register shall contain the address of the property, the price at which the property was sold and the date of sale of the property. <\/p><p>  The Register contains information on residential properties purchased in Ireland since 1 January 2010, as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes. It contains the price paid for individual properties and contains details of all residential sales - both cash sales and sales with mortgages. These stamp duty declarations are primarily filed electronically by persons doing the conveyancing of the property on behalf of the purchaser and errors may occur when the declaration is being made. Any errors in the data are errors made by those making the declaration. In this context, it should be noted that there are a range of penalties which the Revenue Commissioners may impose in circumstances where incorrect stamp duty returns are made to them.<\/p><p>  As stated, the information on which the Register is based, is provided to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes. Consequently, only the Revenue Commissioners are in a position to verify and, where necessary, amend the data in question. The Property Services Regulatory Authority is not in a position to do so. I am advised that on being informed of any apparent inaccuracy in the data in the Register, the Authority immediately informs the Revenue Commissioners and requests that they take whatever remedial action, if any, they deem necessary. The Revenue Commissioners provide data to the Authority weekly in order to maintain the Register up to date and any amendments which they deem necessary are included in the weekly updates. The type of errors reported: include inaccurate prices - generally explained by the fact that prices of new properties in the Register are VAT-exempt; total price of block sales given rather than the individual unit prices; and inaccurate spelling of addresses. <\/p><p>  The Property Services Regulatory Authority has indicated that currently there are a total of 107,579 residential properties on the Register and to date there have been more than 3.3 million visits to the Register by members of the public. The current level of traffic is over 30,000 visits every week. I understand that in the period January 2013 to June 2014 a total of 340 alleged errors were reported to the Authority by members of the public and all of these were referred to the Revenue Commissioners for investigation and any appropriate follow up. I am advised that some 83 of the records concerned have been subsequently amended by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>  Given the number of entries on the Register, the high number of visits to the website by members of the public and the very low level of reported errors (0.3%), I am assured that the Register gives a full and accurate picture of residential property prices in Ireland since 1 January 2010.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500071#WRU05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Council of Europe","counter":1432,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500072#WRV00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1433,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[30776\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500072#WRV00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if applicants for the nomination of the Irish member of the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment will be carried out by an independent panel of experts, as proposed in resolution 1540\/2007 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"977","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1434,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that in June of this year expressions of interest were sought from suitably qualified and experienced persons for nomination as Ireland's representative to the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT).

In addition to the persons directly involved in these judicial review applications there may be other associated family members in the system who have applications pending whose cases cannot be finalised while the judicial review is ongoing<font color=\"#FF0000\">. <\/font>Moreover, many other failed protection applicants do not leave the State when subject to a Deportation Order even though the clear legal requirement is for them to leave the State.<\/p><p>The consequence of all of this is that persons spend longer in direct provision than would be desired.  I have said on a number of occasions since taking up office in my Department that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed.  My immediate priority is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with so that protection seekers spend as little time as necessary in direct provision.<\/p><p>The Government remains committed to legislative reform in this area as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme. In this regard, legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection is a key priority for this Government.<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>Such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  In consultation with my officials, I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide on how best to progress the implementation of the Government's priorities, in particular to expedite those relating to the establishment of a single application procedure.<\/p><p>The direct provision system, which facilitates the State providing for the basic needs of those seeking protection or on other grounds to be allowed to stay in the State, is managed by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department in accordance with Government policy. As at 29 June 2014 there were 4,324 persons availing of direct provision accommodation in 34 centres under contract to RIA.  Approximately 38 % of these residents are children under the age of 18.  Overall, 68 % of RIA residents had first claimed international protection in Ireland three or more years previously.  More detailed information is available on the RIA website - <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i>. The current occupancy of 4,324 compared to the number residing in direct provision at its highest point in April, 2005 (8,080), shows that there has been a reduction of 46%, or 3756 persons in the intervening period.<\/p><p>In relation to accommodation standards and practices, RIA affords the highest priority to the safeguarding and protection of children.   RIA has a fully staffed child and family service unit, the head of which is seconded from the HSE and whose role is to manage, deliver, coordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all residents in the direct provision system.  The unit also acts as a conduit between RIA and Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the latter having statutory functions in this area.<\/p><p>A key feature of the Irish system of accommodating asylum seekers is that services are &lsquo;main streamed&rsquo;.  Social Work supports for children in centres are thus provided through HSE\/Tusla on the same basis as for children in the wider community. Centre staff are provided with training and with any guidance needed on a day-to-day basis by the Child &amp;amp; Family Services Unit in RIA.<\/p><p>In addition to the standard accommodation services and supports provided through Direct Provision accommodation centres, both RIA and other State service providers, particularly the HSE and Tusla, link in with those centres to provide on-site services and monitoring of children and families through Public Health Nurse and GP services, social work teams, mental health specialists and through the positive engagement of accommodation centre management teams.<\/p><p>As regards education, children of asylum seekers are linked to local mainstream primary and post-primary schools in a like manner to the general population and the role of the accommodation centre manager is central to this process. In addition, asylum seeker children can avail of the free ECCE preschool.  More detail on the services and supports available to direct provision centres can be found in RIA&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2013 on its website.<\/p><p>As a general point, RIA engages with service providers to ensure that, from a contractual perspective, standards are continuously improved. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500073#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":1515,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500073#WRW00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1516,"qnumday":598,"qnumall":"[31558\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500073#WRW00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; assigned to tackle child pornography exclusively; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1193","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1517,"content":"<p>I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are tasked with the investigation of criminal activity.<\/p><p>  Investigations and complaints are normally investigated in the Garda District where the report was received and\/ or an investigation commences.<\/p><p>  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are investigating child pornography can avail of the assistance of specialised units within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the investigation of these offences (e.g. the examination of computer and digital media which is suspected to contain child abuse material, is carried out by the Computer Crime Unit attached to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation).<\/p><p>  There is a specialist unit which is part of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with responsibility to investigate child pornography including assisting with reports and investigations that have an international dimension.

Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.

Generally, for the over 70s, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel to work related costs. <\/p><p>  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs.

In addition, a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging (TILDA) is underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500073#WRW02800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tobacco Control Measures","counter":1545,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500073#WRW02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1546,"qnumday":608,"qnumall":"[31418\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500073#WRW02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he notified the Department of the Taoiseach in the context of the preparation of the national risk assessment that he expects the tobacco industry to sue the Government when it introduces plain packaging for tobacco products for compensation over loss of intellectual property rights; if this risk has been or will be quantified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1547,"qnumday":675,"qnumall":"[31419\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500073#WRW03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department has notified the Department of the Taoiseach of any economic or social risks in the context of its preparation of the national risk assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":1548,"qnumday":676,"qnumall":"[31421\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500073#WRW03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department has notified  the Department of the Taoiseach of any economic or social risks to in the context of its preparation of the national risk assessment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1549,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 608, 675 and 676 together.<\/p><p>In its publication entitled &quot;Technical Resource for Country Implementation of WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Article 5.3&quot;, the WHO has outlined the various forms of tobacco industry tactics to interfere with tobacco control measures.

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines. <\/p><p>In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.<\/p><p>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of Fampridine under the GMS or other community drug schemes. <\/p><p>However, I am aware that studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of Fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with MS.

The HSE has established an Expert Panel to examine the range of conditions and services that should be considered as part of this process.  A public consultation has also been undertaken to seek the views of the public, including patients, patient representative groups and professional bodies. The submissions received will inform the work of the Expert Panel.  The panel has been asked to report to the Director General of the Health Service by September 2014.<\/p><p>The first step for a medicine to be placed on the Irish market involves the manufacturer seeking an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency. A determination on the application for authorisation is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against legal and regulatory requirements.  Once authorised on the Irish market, the supplier must make an application to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for the product to be included on the list of products covered under the GMS and other community drug schemes. The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p><p>Applications for reimbursement are considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the HSE may ask the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) to conduct a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the new product which provides detailed information on the potential budget impact of the medicine. It also assesses whether the product is cost effective at the price quoted by the company in question. The NCPE report is an important input to assist the HSE in its decision making process and informs further discussions between the HSE and the supplier. The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500074#WRX00700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Reviews","counter":1599,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500074#WRX00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1600,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[30834\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500074#WRX00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the generic letter requesting further details of savings and investments sent to over-70s undergoing the medical card review is causing much confusion and duplication of documents, as the information needed in each individual case is not specified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1601,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

In November 2012 the Government announced its decision that the new children&rsquo;s hospital will be co-located with St James&rsquo;s on its campus, ensuring it benefits from the broadest possible range of adult sub-specialty expertise and research capability, and will ultimately be tri-located there with a maternity hospital. Satellite centres, which will share governance and staffing with the new children's hospital, will be built on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.   While issues such as access are clearly very important, the Government's decision was based on the over-riding priority of best clinical outcomes for our children. Tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services brings benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers. In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus. In addition, tri-location that delivers the most significant depth and breadth of clinical and academic research on site will enhance the potential of research to drive best clinical outcomes. St James's Hospital has the broadest range of national specialties of all acute adult hospitals, as well as strong and well established research and education infrastructure.<\/p><p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is the body responsible for planning, designing, building and equipping the hospital and has been actively progressing the project on the new site. The Project Brief for the hospital on the St James's campus has been agreed, a decant strategy for the site is in place and is actively being progressed, and a preferred design team has been selected and is expected to be appointed in mid-July. Design development will then begin with the aim of making a planning submission in February 2015. <\/p><p>  A number of specific concerns have been raised by this parent.  Firstly, in regard to road access, I would like to reassure this parent that access planning will be a significant part of this project. The design team, to be appointed in mid-July, will include traffic management specialists as a key component. These specialists' role will include modelling of access routes and development of a mobility management plan to address traffic peaks. <\/p><p>  In regard to green spaces, I can confirm that the Project Brief as approved specifies that the new hospital will include play areas, external gardens and courtyards.<\/p><p>  On the concern about adult patients, I want to emphasise that no adults will be treated in the new children's hospital. Although it will be on a shared campus with St James's, with controlled corridor linkage, the new children's hospital will be a separate building with its own public entrance, paediatric ED and outpatient entrances, and only children will be treated there.<\/p><p>  As design development gets underway, there will be structured process of stakeholder consultation and input which will be led through the Children's Hospital Group and will include children, young people, families, advocacy groups, the staff of the three children's hospitals and the community. I urge all stakeholders, including parents and parents' groups, to engage in this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500074#WRX03600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":1641,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500074#WRX03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1642,"qnumday":638,"qnumall":"[30971\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500074#WRX03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 139 of 25 June 2014 and 209 to 212, inclusive, of 4 June 2014, when the information requested will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1643,"content":"<p>I am aware that a reminder issued to the HSE and I have issued a further one.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  However, in light of legal advice following on a ruling of the High Court, children born after 1 June 2002 are being treated by the HSE as eligible to apply for an assessment under the Act.  Part 2 of the 2005 Act provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants, occasioned by their disability, to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  <\/p><p>  Although the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it has taken a number of measures to address the issue.  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child. <\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into integrated multidisciplinary geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the implementation of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme.  This involves the roll-out of a new model of service, the objective of which is to bring about equity and consistency, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their difficulty.

Under the legislation, there is no entitlement to a medical card based on a particular disease or illness.<\/p><p>Therefore, the Government has decided to develop a new policy framework of eligibility for health services to take account of medical conditions, in addition to the existing basis of financial means. The HSE has established an expert panel to examine the range of conditions and services that should be considered as part of this process. A public consultation was also undertaken and the HSE is putting in place a Consultative Forum of representative patient groups to enable them to feed into the process in a structured fashion.  The expert panel has been asked to make a report by September. <\/p><p>In the context of this policy development, the HSE suspended reviews, including appeals, of existing medical cards where discretion had been exercised to take account of medical circumstances, pending the outcome of this process. The HSE has extended eligibility of the individuals concerned.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding the measures outlined above, the legislative provisions of the Health Act have not changed. All applications for a medical card will continue to be assessed against the HSE&rsquo;s National Assessment Guidelines in accordance with the overall legislation. However, the HSE is currently examining how individuals, who are not entitled to a medical card, could still receive services that meet their needs. The clear intention is to maximise the supports that can be provided in each case to the fullest extent possible.  The HSE is seeking to find the best way to achieve this in order to ensure families will receive the support they need.<\/p><p>The Government was also concerned that a number of people with serious medical conditions had been refused the renewal of their discretionary medical card since the centralisation of medical card assessment was completed in mid-2011.  Therefore, the Government decided that medical cards or GP visit cards are to issue to persons, with a serious medical condition or disability, who had the renewal of their discretionary card refused by the HSE, having completed an eligibility review during the period from 1 July 2011 to 31 May 2014. <\/p><p>The HSE has been working to identify persons with serious medical conditions who may qualify for a discretionary card. In this regard, the HSE has already issued in the region of 10,000 cards.  However, until the HSE has completed its examination on a case by case basis, it is not possible to provide a definitive figure of the cards that will issue.<\/p><p>With regard to <i>ad misericordiam<\/i>appeals, it should be borne in mind that the HSE might not have a record of a person having a serious medical condition and so, therefore, cannot make contact. This approach provides an opportunity to those individuals who did not complete their review during the defined period due to circumstances relating to their medical condition, e.g., hospitalisation during treatment, change of residence during treatment, to contact the HSE. The HSE envisages that most people, about whom it has information, that qualify for a discretionary card will have been contacted by mid July.<\/p><p>The Government remains committed to the introduction of a universal GP service for the entire population as part of Universal Health Insurance, in line with the Programme for Government. The over 70s will be prioritised in the next phase of the roll-out of free access to GP care, with the subsequent extension of free GP care to the 6-11 year old and then 12-17 year old cohorts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500077#WRAA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1868,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500077#WRAA03250"},{"type":"question","counter":1869,"qnumday":721,"qnumall":"[31674\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500077#WRAA03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a medical card application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":1870,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

In the case of Dublin Bus services, the routes that will be opened to tender are the orbital routes and some local routes around the city. For Bus &Eacute;ireann services, the routes for tender will be the city services in Waterford and certain commuter routes into Dublin along the N4 and N7 corridors,\u00a0including\u00a0route 120 from Tullamore.<\/p><p>  The principal concern when looking at the future of bus services is to provide a better service to those people who currently use those\u00a0services, and more importantly, getting those people who don&rsquo;t, to use those bus services. As at present, the fares, timetables and service standards will be set by the NTA. I have been informed that the NTA intends that free travel passes will be honoured by any new operator and is currently in discussion with the Department of Social Protection in this regard.

One of the recommendations contained in that report was that <i>&ldquo;&hellip; section 11(1)(e) should be amended to clarify that the exclusion regarding the administration of law in the area of asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship relates solely to decisions taken by the relevant authorities in accordance with statutory procedures for determining whether  a person is entitled to a particular status.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>My Department engaged with the Department of Justice and Equality, which has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration. The then Minister for Justice and Equality considered that no legislative change was required and this position has recently been reaffirmed by that Department.<\/p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality outlined a number of concerns with regard to the complexity of the multistage asylum process, the existing avenues of appeal inherent in that process and difficulty in divorcing decisions relating to immigration status from other aspects of a case. He referred to similarities with the exclusion of immigration matters from Freedom of Information and Ombudsman legislation and felt that it would be incongruous that a different approach would be taken in respect of the Ombudsman for Children. The Minister pointed out that Direct Provision services require that each relevant Department or State agency provide services to residents in line with their role. In this way, the HSE provides health services and supports, Department of Social Protection provides Community Welfare and associated supports and the Department of Education and Skills, through the schools, provide for the education needs of school going children. The Minister further noted that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service continues to engage with the Office of the Ombudsman for Children on an administrative basis in relation to any case it brings to its attention and respond to any issues raised.<\/p><p>The matter to which the Deputy refers concerning asylum seekers in direct provision was debated with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform during Second and Committee Stages of the parliamentary process towards enactment of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012. This debate also addressed the situation of children in direct provision. That Act of 2012 primarily addressed the office of the Ombudsman and significantly amended the Ombudsman Act 1980. In the process towards the enactment of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, my Department worked closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Ombudsman for Children to achieve a significant expansion of the remit of her office. With effect from 1<sup>st<\/sup>May 2013, the bodies within the remit of each Ombudsman and the process for changes to their remits have been greatly expanded and largely aligned. <\/p><p>Some outstanding recommendations from the above-mentioned reports of March 2012 are being reviewed in conjunction with other Departments and I will consider the need to bring forward legislative proposals in due course, if appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500080#WRDD03700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Provision","counter":2049,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500080#WRDD03750"},{"type":"question","counter":2050,"qnumday":810,"qnumall":"[30837\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500080#WRDD03800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding the promised review on both the CCS  and the CETS schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

To date the ASCC programme primarily provided support for those entering employment.  This enhancement will provide eligible customers with the choice to avail of after-school child-care support while on an employment programme, when entering or increasing their employment or a combination of both.  In addition OFP customers will now receive the same level of support under the programme as those in receipt of a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment i.e. they can avail of this support if they take-up part-time work or an employment programme, and still retain part of their OFP payment.  Previously OFP recipients were only eligible if they left the payment to take-up employment.

Pobal's role involves supporting and overseeing fiscal management, grant administration, and governance, while CES focuses on supporting service design, implementation, and evaluation. <\/p><p>  With specific reference to the Consortium in question, the pre-approval design stage involved further development of their Consortium&rsquo;s proposal.  Support and guidance was provided by the Centre for Effective Services (CES) and Pobal. On 26 February 2014 both Pobal and CES informed all ten consortia that an arrangement had been agreed with the funders for a &quot;Fast-Track&quot; approval mechanism for any Area in a position to progress immediately once they could provide a fully-developed proposal for immediate consideration (i.e. a sufficiently developed Logic Model, implementation plan and budget).  On 4 April last, the National College of Ireland (NCI) on behalf of the Docklands and East Dublin ABC Consortium applied for the Fast-track stream. <\/p><p>  The applications and documentation from Docklands and East Dublin ABC Consortium were reviewed by CES and Pobal at a meeting on 23 April.  The recommendation of the CES and Pobal as managing Agencies of the ABC Programme was that the proposal from Docklands and East Dublin ABC Consortium was not ready to proceed to operational phase and that the proposal required additional clarification and refinement.  This recommendation was submitted to the ABC Programme Working Group on Thursday 1 May, which decided that the application of Docklands and East Dublin ABC Consortium would not be fast-tracked, but rather considered in the next phase of applications to allow sufficient time to prepare a thorough and clearly costed plan.<\/p><p>  This decision was communicated to the Consortia with follow-up from CES and Pobal.<\/p><p>  The ABC Consortium has met with CES and Pobal who have outlined a clear course of action to progress this project. This on-going work includes the preparation and submission of a fully developed proposal (i.e. a sufficiently developed Logic Model, implementation plan and clearly identified and aligned budget).<\/p><p>  I understand that work is on-going with the Consortia and in this regard, I want to confirm that the budget remains available to this Consortium subject to the Consortium meeting the relevant requirements including the development of relevant programmes which all of the other successful Consortia are required to meet.  <\/p><p>  You will appreciate that where programmes for children and young are being provided and where State funding is concerned, robust plans including budgetary plans and systems must be in place in order to ensure the effective delivery of programmes for those for whom funding is being provided.<\/p><p>  I look forward to the completion of this work in the near future and the successful progression of the six remaining projects, including Dublin Docklands Consortia, into the operational phase of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500081#WREE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Completion Programme","counter":2077,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500081#WREE01850"},{"type":"question","counter":2078,"qnumday":821,"qnumall":"[31053\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500081#WREE01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the total funding for the school completion programme, for each of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1038","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2079,"content":"<p>The School Completion Programme (SCP) aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort.

It involves 124 locally managed projects and related initiatives operating across 470 primary and 224 post-primary schools to provide targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.

It is a matter of record that the Centre at Darndale has been experiencing cash flow difficulties.  The Centre incurred expenditure of &euro;2.022m in 2013 and received funding amounting to &euro;1.96m, resulting in a deficit of &euro;62,000. Projections by the Centre show that income of approximately &euro;1.8m is anticipated during 2014.  With such a level of financial support available, it should be possible to work constructively to continue services and avoid the closure scenario that has been outlined by the Centre. <\/p><p>  As Minister Flanagan indicated last week, senior representatives from the Child and Family Agency, Pobal, Dublin City Childcare Committee and representatives from the board and management of the Centre have met on a number of occasions to explore options available to ensure that the service can operate on a sustainable basis into the future within the allocated funding. A number of options were considered and to assist in this process, Dublin City Childcare Committee engaged the services of an external mentor to undertake an independent detailed analysis of the matter. In parallel, a wider examination will be undertaken of the level and range of early years services supported by the State in the Darndale\/Belcamp\/Moatview area generally.   <\/p><p>  The Child and Family Agency, as one of a number of State funders of the Centre, kindly agreed to make additional pre-payments to the end of August while the review was being conducted. I want to acknowledge the support of the Agency in this regard. The payments were in addition to previous pre-payments advanced by the Agency for May and June. The Agency stressed that this is as much as they are prepared to commit to while the process outlined above is continuing. <\/p><p>  I understand that the external mentor has now completed a detailed analysis and review of the services provided. Officials from my Department are meeting today with representatives from the Child and Family Agency, Pobal and the Dublin City Childcare Committee, at which the Department will receive a briefing on the content of the report and the options available arising from the review process. I will be briefed by my officials arising from today's meeting and will consider the findings of the report. <\/p><p>  I understand that the Board of the Centre is due to meet again on 17 July. The Centre last week reiterated its previously expressed view that it will be forced to close thereafter in the absence of additional funding. This is to be regretted, given that the final report was only made available yesterday, 14 July, 2014. Furthermore, I understand that the draft report prepared by the external mentor, and seen by the Centre, identified a number of actions that can be taken to create a sustainable model of service delivery within the resources currently available to the Centre. <\/p><p>  In all of the circumstances I would hope that the constructive dialogue which has taken place over recent weeks between the parties will continue until all options have been jointly and fully discussed. I very much hope that a satisfactory outcome can be arrived at which will ensure the continued operation of the Centre within the significant funding levels available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500081#WREE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":2090,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500081#WREE02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2091,"qnumday":825,"qnumall":"[31441\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500081#WREE02800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will provide a list of all the youth groups funded by his Department that are based in the Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central constituencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2092,"content":"<p>My Department administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.

As is the case with other services, funding requirements for the operation of this service going forward will be considered in the context of the Estimates process.<\/p><p>  Members of the public may call the 116 000 Hotline if they see a missing child or if they have information to pass on regarding a missing child. Information in this regard is published on the ISPCC web page entitled 'Missing Childrens Hotline.' It is important to appreciate that the Hotline is a support service rather than an emergency service.  Where callers require assistance outside the scope of the services provided by the Hotline, they are referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or whichever branch of the emergency services is appropriate. Staff of the Missing Children Hotline will also pass on information to the emergency services when it is appropriate to do so. <\/p><p>  The 116 000 Hotline was set up to provide advice and emotional support to parents\/guardians whose child is missing. This advice and support may also be accessed by the extended family of a child who is missing or, indeed, by the child themselves. A key component of the service is an awareness programme. <\/p><p>  During the initial set up phase of the service, the ISPCC focused on community based promotion of the service.  This included presentations to local community groups.  Subsequently, posters, flyers and business cards have been distributed to all Garda stations from Garda Headquarters, and promotional material has been distributed to a variety of community based projects in various locations throughout the country.  Further, the ISPCC makes extensive use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter to advertise this service on an ongoing basis.  The 116 000 Missing Children Hotline website (www.missingchildrenhotline.ie) also serves to promote the service.  Website hits in the first quarter of 2014 were 16,468, an increase of 182%  over the total number of hits for the entirety of 2013 -  i.e. 6,059.  <\/p><p>  Service promotion for the Hotline has continued in 2014.  Traditional advertising such as poster distribution, outreaches and networking is continuing.  Social media is also being utilized.  The ISPCC has secured advertising space in bus and train stations nationally.  <\/p><p>  Posters have been distributed in Louth, Meath, Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Cork and Galway.  These posters were placed in schools, community centres, health centres, libraries and local shops.  <\/p><p>  From its inception in 2013 to the end of the first quarter of 2014 a total of 591 calls were made to the Hotline.<\/p><p>The core aim of the service is to connect with potential service users.  In order to achieve this the ISPCC will continue to promote the service locally and nationally.  International Missing Children&rsquo;s Day took place on 25 May 2014 and the ISPCC held a national social media campaign to highlight the issue of missing children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500081#WREE04400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Preschool Services","counter":2114,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500081#WREE04450"},{"type":"question","counter":2115,"qnumday":832,"qnumall":"[31591\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014071500081#WREE04500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will include a child (details supplied) in the ECCE programme.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2116,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is a free and universal programme which provides  a free preschool year to all eligible children. <\/p><p>  Children are eligible to avail of the free preschool year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September in the relevant year.
